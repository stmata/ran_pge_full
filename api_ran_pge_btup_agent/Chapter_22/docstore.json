Cahill\nNorth Union Associates, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA\nDiscusses Wright\u2019s recent\nattack on targeting andsegmentation theory. Pro-poses that, although Wrighthas some valid criticismsabout speci\ufb01c applications ofthe concepts, targeting andsegmentation are acceptableand defensible marketingstrategies if properlydesigned. Gives some indica-tions of possible methods forsegmenting that may meetWright\u2019s criticisms.Recently , Malcom Wright presented a daunt-\ning challenge to the marketing discipline[1] \u2013to justify the ongoing use of segmentationand target marketing. Although his article\nwas written in response to what he character-\nized as a \u201cstartling\u201d argument by Mitchellthat zodiac signs be used for segmentation[2],he used the occasion to attack the concepts ofsegmentation and targeting per se.\nAlthough Mitchell\u2019s example of zodiacal\nsegmentation was perhaps light-hearted, hisargument is not. Mitchell posits, as do mostmarketing academics and practitioners, thatthe \ufb01rm will be better off \u2013 in terms of greaterunit sales at (possibly) higher prices and/orlower cost of sales \u2013 by emphasizing ourapproach to certain groups of people and de-emphasizing our approach to others.\nWright\u2019s argument\nIn essence, Wright totally denies the validityof segmentation and targeting on twogrounds. The \ufb01rst ground is that, for segmen-tation to have validity , the segments are asso-ciated with a stable set of preferences. Thesecond ground is that, even if segmentationworks, we need to prove that targeting thesesegments provides a superior return to the\ufb01rm than does shotgun marketing. Heholds[1] that neither ground has been proven,either by Mitchell or by marketers in general.But is he correct?\nTarget marketing de\ufb01ned and \nexplained\nNot all customers are alike. As unprofound as\nthis statement may appear , it is one whichneeds to be repeated frequently . Hallbergmakes the point succinctly by making it thetitle of his book[3]. He further makes thepoint bluntly in stating that the Pareto Prin-ciple holds \u2013 and the 20 per cent (or whateverthe percentage actually is) who are your mostpro\ufb01table customers are going to be the onlygroup that holds your brand\u2019s pro\ufb01ts abovewater in the future. Further , if you do not\nbuild brand loyalty through a sound loyalty\nprogramme with your high-pro\ufb01t customers,you are dead. Duboff[4] phrases this slightlydifferently , stating that the steps are to iden-\ntify pro\ufb01table customers, learn their values,\nanalyse the offerings they need and use, focusmarketing on them (and, implicitly , ignorethe non-pro\ufb01table customers), and monitortheir satisfaction. This is as good and suc-cinct a description of target marketing andsegmentation for pro\ufb01tability as I have seen.\nA \u201ctarget market\u201d is, at its most basic,\nsimply the market or submarket (such as asegment) at which the \ufb01rm aims its market-ing message(s). There is nothing inherent inthe concept of target marketing that requiresa \ufb01rm to segment, or \u2013 having segmented \u2013 todevelop multiple product offerings or market-ing messages. It simply means that a group ofcustomers has been identi\ufb01ed for whom theoffering should be \u201cright\u201d and to whom the\ufb01rm will direct the majority of its marketingtime, resources, and attention, with the ratio-nale that it is better to use a ri\ufb02e than a shot-gun to get results. (This rationale shouldpossibly be reconsidered; in the Gun\ufb01ght atOK Corral, it was Doc Holliday using a shot-\ngun who killed people, not the Earps using\npistols.) Nevertheless, it seems usual thatwhen \ufb01rms target market, they do so for mul-tiple targets within a broader market.\nIn a brief case study , Freeman[5] outlines\nthe story of COMBAT , an insecticide whichfollowed a highly targeted strategy with adegree of success. As Freeman points out,there are problems with such a strategy . \u201cTheonly disadvantage of this focused segmenta-tion approach was that while the businesswas clearly stronger where advertising wasfocused, it was also clearly less strong whereit was not focused\u201d[5, p. 17].", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4163, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b17ee977-ec37-483a-87e5-2a060957c6fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b17ee977-ec37-483a-87e5-2a060957c6fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e790f28-6a2e-4c18-8e33-0879ce344c6b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "hash": "487cdc310f7b708c377066cf68fd95567121356e0c0e6431f03201195dbe8792", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e7180c7-18a7-40ec-b64d-46d2e07431c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "hash": "92b4cd8f95fcf7d5abaaf291f52d3bbd95f7e1f7ed838ad8657e0d393bd20c49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "228933ed-3bca-456c-8d2e-8b2068e9531d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d1dff0dc1ca4011bb1f100a5c650cdb648c4ad1bf467e88556ef9dbf8c4168c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(This rationale shouldpossibly be reconsidered; in the Gun\ufb01ght atOK Corral, it was Doc Holliday using a shot-\ngun who killed people, not the Earps using\npistols.)

No.\nAnything new in the above argument? Not\nreally , at least not for those who have kept up\nwith trends in several areas of marketing,\nnamely database and direct marketing. Themajor thrust of the Hallberg thesis, h owever,\nis that all of this applies even to brandedpackaged goods; one of the examples he cites\nover and over again is Zip-Loc bags \u2013 hardly a\nbig-ticket item. Much of what he says hasbeen touted for years for higher-priced items;Hallberg states that the same points are true\nfor a grocery store item costing about $1.00\nper unit, or even less.\nHallberg, who has worked at both J. Walter\nThompson and (currently) Ogilvy and\nMather , reports on several years of research\ndone by task forces at Ogilvy which investi-gated the erosion of their clients\u2019 margins;the cause was increased spending on promo-\ntion and reduced spending on advertising \u2013\nnothing new here, either . Nor without self-interest, as advertising agencies typicallymake higher fees from advertising than they\ndo from promotion. The leap that Hallberg\nwas able to make was to translate this state-ment into a means of building brand prof-itability by building customer loyalty to the\nbrand. He states that loyal customers will\nspend more for the brands in their consideredset. When this is coupled with a search for theheavy users in the category (again, hardly anew concept), the willingness to pay a higher\nprice plus heavier-than-average usage of the\nproduct makes for explosive pro\ufb01tability ofthis segment. Hallberg also presents themathematics to back up his assertions. It is\nclear (and intuitive) that loyal heavy users\nmake a bigger-than-average contribution tothe brand\u2019s pro\ufb01tability . The difficulty is in\ufb01nding these people and keeping them loyal;\nbut there is no doubt that such a search is\nworthwhile.\nThat is what target marketing is all about:\nde\ufb01ning who it is that we want to attract for\ncustomers \u2013 and striving to ensure that these\nwill be the loyal, high-pro\ufb01t customers Hall-berg and others emphasize. And, at least asimportant, de\ufb01ning who it is that we do not\ncare to attract. For target marketing at least\nimplies that there are customers whom we donot wish to target, that we will serve if possi-ble but will make no special effort to serve \u2013\nand that there may be individuals whom we\ndo not wish to serve at all. And that is all thata target market consists of \u2013 and truly all thattarget marketing is.\nWhy is target marketing so important?\nThere are really two major reasons. The \ufb01rst\nis that it forces a strategic focus to the \ufb01rm,forcing the \ufb01rm to look towards a realisticapproach to its customers and its product/service offerings and to determine the best\n\ufb01t(s) between them. Second, it forces a strate-gic focus on the \ufb01rm, which begins outsidewith the customers and the market, and not\ninside with the \ufb01rm. In short, it requires the\nuse of the marketing concept as part of the\ufb01rm\u2019s strategic marketing planning.\nSegmentation considerations\nSegmentation \u2013 the dividing of a total marketinto its component parts by some scheme(various methods will be described here) \u2013 isnot new .

We want to develop cus-tomers in the segments that are most prof-itable to our \ufb01rm by giving the customers inthose segments what they want and commu-nicating with them, in language that they canunderstand, that we have done so. If we can dothis in a way that keeps customers whom wedo not want to attract from seeing or hearingour communications and thus staying away ,so much the better . This is what Yavitz andNewman[12, p. 162] in another context havecalled \u201cthe right person and the right carrot\u201d.In other words, the correct segment of cus-tomers and the correct offering. This is theeasiest and surest method for developingcompetitive advantage \u2013 doing somethingbetter than the competition.\nWhat is the real question here?\nAlthough Wright\u2019s argument is based on thefact that segmentation and targeting arede\ufb01cient in theoretical foundations, whatseems to be his true objection seems to be\nthat product-speci\ufb01c segmentation schemes\nare frequently subject to judgement-baseddecisions made prior to the cluster analysisthat creates most segmentation typologies.Although Wright is correct, so far as hisargument goes, he is not necessarily correct.\nTypologies can be an important method of\ntheory building, not just a descriptive tool.\nDoty and Glick[13] state that typologies arenot simply \u201csloppy classi\ufb01cation system[s]\u201d.Properly constructed they are \u201ccomplex theo-retical statements that should be subjected toquantitative modeling and rigorous empiricaltesting\u201d. \nThey state the following guidelines to\nimprove the development of typologies whichare theory-building: typological theoristsshould make explicit their grand theoreticalassertion(s); typologies must de\ufb01ne com-pletely the set of ideal types; typologies mustprovide complete descriptions of each idealtype using the same set of dimensions; typo-logical theories should explicitly state theassumptions about the theoretical impor-tance of each construct used to describe the\nideal types; typological theories must be\ntested with conceptual and analytical modelsthat are consistent with the theory .\nIs there a way out?\nFurther research is not the answer to theseeming dilemma posed by Wright\u2019s argu-ments against segmentation and target mar-keting. These two techniques are far tooimportant to marketing to be abandoned (seeCahill[14] for a further discussion).\nSo where do we go?\nPart of Wright\u2019s difficulty with segmentationseems to be the plethora of single-use segmen-tation schemes to which he (and anyone elsewho reads the literature) has been exposed.And, given the defects of these schemes \u2013 thesmall sample sizes, the fact that many of thestudies are based on convenience samples ofuniversity students who may or may not\nactually use the product in question, etc. \u2013 he\nhas every right to be concerned about suchdefects as segment stability .

Cahill\nTarget marketing and \nsegmentation: valid and\nuseful tools for marketing\nManagement Decision\n35/1 [1997] 10\u201313banks to build a composite picture of his\nconsumer behaviour . \nSchemes such as V ALS and V ALS 2 (by SRI\nInternational of Menlo Park, California (see[15] for an introduction) or List of Values (byLynne Kahle of the University of Oregon and\nvarious associates (see [16] for an introduc-\ntion) address these larger issues of stabilityand predictability across a vast array of prod-ucts and services, albeit largely for the USA.A further bene\ufb01t to the use of such schemes isthe additional understanding of the\nconsumer and the ability to communicate\nwith him or her that such a broad-brushscheme permits.\nIt is particularly important to remember\nwhy we segment: to increase total salesand/or reduce sales costs. We do not segment\nsimply because we can, nor do we segment to\nderive a theoretically elegant scheme. With-out the ability to communicate easily withpeople in a segment while excluding thosewho do not belong in that segment, a scheme\nloses applicability . Thus, an interesting explo-\nration into segmentation based on theLuscher Color Test \u2013 an attempt to link thetest back to psychographic pro\ufb01les[17] \u2013 failsin the practicality test because, no matterhow effective the results, they cannot be used\nwell to communicate with the segments,\nwhich is part of the goal of any segmentationscheme. Ultimately , this is the rock on whichMitchell\u2019s fanciful use of astrological signswould founder .\nNevertheless, we do have ways to segment\nbeyond the syndicated methods discussed\nabove. Given the rise of loyalty programmesmonitored by scanners, retailers (and manu-facturers, to a lesser extent) can certainlysegment their customers on behaviouraldata: what are they actually buying, matched\nagainst who they are (data which are col-\nlected when the individual joins the loyaltyprogramme), where they live, and where elsethey shop. The drawback with these data is, ofcourse, that they are only valid for customerswho join the programme: non-customers are\nnot included. Nevertheless, scanner data hold\nout the promise of taking segmentation to thenext level of applicability \u2013 if, perhaps, not tothe next level of theoretical integrity whichWright would like to see.\nReferences\n1 Wright, M., \u201cThe dubious assumptions of\nsegmentation and targeting\u201d, Management\nDecision, Vol. 34 No. 1, 1996, pp. 18-24.2 Mitchell, V .-W ., \u201cUsing astrology in market\nsegmentation\u201d, Management Decision, Vol. 33\nNo. 1, 1995, pp. 48-57.\n3 Hallberg, G., All Consumers Are NOT Created\nEqual: The Differential Marketing Strategy for\nBrand Loyalty and Pro\ufb01ts, John Wiley & Co.,\nChichester and New York, NY , 1995. \n4 Duboff, R.S., \u201cMarketing to maximize prof-\nitability\u201d, Journal of Business Strategy, Vol. 13,\nNovember-December 1992, pp. 10-3.\n5 Freeman, K.M., \u201cTarget marketing: the logic of\nit all\u201d, The Journal of Consumer Marketing,\nVol. 9 No. 3, 1992, pp. 15-8.\n6 Wilkie, W .L. and Cohen, J.B., \u201c An overview of\nmarket segmentation: behavioral concepts andresearch approaches\u201d, Marketing Science\nInstitute, Cambridge, MA, Working Paper 77-\n105, 1977.\n7 Weinstein, A., Market Segmentation: Using\nNiche Marketing to Exploit New Markets,\nProbus Publishing Co., Chicago, IL, 1987.\n8 Weinstein, A., Market Segmentation: Using\nDemographics, Psychographics and Other\nNiche Marketing Techniques to Predict Cus-tomer Behavior , revised ed., Probus Publishing\nCo., Chicago, IL, 1994.\n9 Porter , M.E., Competitive Advantage: Creating\nand Sustaining Superior Performance, The\nFree Press, New York, NY , 1985.\n10 Schnaars, S.P ., Marketing Strategy: A Cus-\ntomer-Driven Approach, The Free Press, New\nYork, NY , 1991.\n11 Davidow , W .H., Marketing High Technology: An\nInsider\u2019s View, The Free Press, New York, NY ,\n1986.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3821, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e159af54-e00c-422d-9bb2-2ceb4e1e7d88": {"__data__": {"id_": "e159af54-e00c-422d-9bb2-2ceb4e1e7d88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2205d158-d6e1-4e74-8cd5-cce11913e22a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "hash": "0c4d84427cf104a4bec1b4e267676cde84a00d6034ab40c570f207dcf1edfe86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e5cdb8b-b57b-4053-97d9-979c72532051", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap22.pdf"}, "hash": "bf463d377bba33eadd46d8ea246e7a2703c849d1d9ceec4fdd55192d7d21fc9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7 Weinstein, A., Market Segmentation: Using\nNiche Marketing to Exploit New Markets,\nProbus Publishing Co., Chicago, IL, 1987.\n8 Weinstein, A., Market Segmentation: Using\nDemographics, Psychographics and Other\nNiche Marketing Techniques to Predict Cus-tomer Behavior , revised ed., Probus Publishing\nCo., Chicago, IL, 1994.\n9 Porter , M.E., Competitive Advantage: Creating\nand Sustaining Superior Performance, The\nFree Press, New York, NY , 1985.\n10 Schnaars, S.P ., Marketing Strategy: A Cus-\ntomer-Driven Approach, The Free Press, New\nYork, NY , 1991.\n11 Davidow , W .H., Marketing High Technology: An\nInsider\u2019s View, The Free Press, New York, NY ,\n1986.\n12 Yavitz, B. and Newman, W .H., Strategy in\nAction: The Execution, Politics, and Payoff of\nBusiness Planning, The Free Press, New York,\nNY , 1982.\n13 Doty , D.H. and Glick, W .H., \u201cTypologies as a\nunique form of theory building: toward\nimproved understanding and modeling\u201d, The\nAcademy of Management Review, Vol. 19 No. 2,\n1994, pp. 230-51.\n14 Cahill, D.J., How Do You Pick a Hotel?
