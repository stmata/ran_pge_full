As the competition from other streaming services \n(such as Amazon, Apple, and Hulu) intensified and licensing costs for original content increased, \nNetflix began to invest heavily in developing original content. In 2018 alone, Netflix had approxi -\nmately 700 original shows, with more in the pipeline. To pay for new content, Netflix had to augment \nits services and pricing structure. Since the introduction of its streaming service in November 2010, \nNetflix has extended the portfolio of service offerings, while at the same time raising the price. Three \nyears after the launch of the $7.99-a-month streaming service, it introduced a premium version \npriced at $11.99. A year later, in May 2014, Netflix introduced a lower-tier basic service priced at \n$7.99, while raising the price of its standard service to $8.99. The following year, Netflix raised the \nprice of the standard service to $9.99, followed by another price increase to $10.99 in 2017 that \nwas combined with raising the premium service price to $13.99. Then, in 2019, Netflix announced \nanother price hike\u2014the largest since the inception of its streaming services\u2014with the basic \n subscription priced at $8.99, the standard subscription at $10.99 (increased to $12.99 in 2020), \nand the premium subscription at $15.99.

Bargaining \nis still a sport in some areas. Setting one price for all buyers is a relatively modern idea that arose with \nthe development of large-scale retailing at the end of the 19th century. F.W. Woolworth, Tiffany & Co., \nJohn Wanamaker, and others advertised a \u201cstrictly one-price policy,\u201d an efficient approach because they \ncarried so many items and supervised so many employees.\nTraditionally, price has operated as a major determinant of buyer choice. Consumers and purchas -\ning agents who have access to price information and price discounters put pressure on retailers to lower \ntheir prices. Retailers in turn put pressure on manufacturers to lower their  prices. The result can be a \nmarketplace characterized by heavy discounting and sales promotion.\nFor over 25 years, the internet has been changing the way buyers and sellers interact. The internet \nhas enabled buyers to make instant price comparisons from thousands of vendors . Moreover, using \nsmart mobile devices, customers can easily make price comparisons in stores before deciding whether \nto purchase, pressure the retailer to match or better the price, or buy elsewhere. Using promotional \nplatforms such as Groupon, customers can also pool their resources to get better pricing.\nGroupon  Groupon was launched in 2008 to help businesses leverage the internet and e-mail \nto use promotions as a form of advertisement. Specifically, the company sends its large base \nof subscribers a humorously worded daily deal\u2014a specific percentage or dollar amount off the \nregular price\u2014for a specific client\u2019s branded product or service. With these e-mailed discounts, \nGroupon offers client firms three benefits: increased consumer exposure to the brand, the ability to \nprice-discriminate, and the creation of a \u201cbuzz factor.\u201d Groupon takes 40 percent to 50\u00a0percent of \nthe revenues in each deal in the process. Many promotions are offered on behalf of local retailers \nsuch as spas, fitness centers, and restaurants, but Groupon also manages deals on behalf of \nsome national brands. Some businesses have complained that Groupon attracts only deal-seekers \nand is not effective in converting them to regular customers. One study found that 32 percent of \ncompanies lost money and that 40 percent said they would not utilize such a promotion again, with \nrestaurants faring the worst among service businesses and with spas and salons being the most \nsuccessful. Groupon has tried to innovate in several ways. Leveraging its massive sales force to \nsell Groupon Now, the company enlists local businesses to offer  time- and location-specific deals \nvia the Web or smartphones. The iPhone app for the new service has two buttons, \u201cI\u2019m Bored\u201d and \n\u201cI\u2019m Hungry,\u201d to trigger deals in real time. For businesses, the service is a way to boost traffic at \notherwise slow times. Even a popular restaurant might still consider some mid-day and mid-week \ndiscounts, knowing it is rarely full then. After a hyped IPO, Groupon\u2019s stock has not performed well, \nand the company is still struggling to find the right business\u00a0formula.2\n>> Via a daily deal to its \nlarge subscriber base, \nGroupon attempts to \nhelp businesses, many \nof them local, tap into \nthe burgeoning online \nmarket in exchange for \na hefty percentage of \nsales.\nSource: seewhatmitchsee/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3447, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09f98966-5b98-44d5-8a78-489dc9ab1675": {"__data__": {"id_": "09f98966-5b98-44d5-8a78-489dc9ab1675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a8cab6b-ff36-4459-af43-fc2b25de06d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "c1871211c3c5a0c37d527597c12f3e2eab6981e1937119aca82fee38bd3475e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "df47a672-fd11-44a6-82c8-fd0a87612100", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "c65b9ba58c948889778b165a1d48f8bb17a099b58c94f402145f30c2a4d0119f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "272a4274-91d2-4dc0-aaf0-cc6fdea354f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8717295c0396340b153d8e9d5d13fe12605e147f89fff6d3c6b069bd4d74eac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 11    |  MANAGING  PrIcING AND  SALES  PrOMOTIONS  241\nIn addition to empowering buyers, the internet also enables sellers to optimize their pricing. Thus, \nsellers now can monitor market demand and adjust prices accordingly. For example, Uber is using \u201csurge\u201d \npricing, charging higher fares at times of high demand. In addition, companies are now able to offer \ncustom-tailored sales promotions based on the profile of a given market segment or an individual buyer. \nOnline retailers such as Amazon, Wayfair, and Target offer promotional incentives to consumers based \non their demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics. Likewise, many brick-and-mortar \nretail outlets use geolocation to offer promotions to customers who are in close proximity to the store.\nCompanies vary in the way they set their pricing. In many small companies, the owner sets prices. \nIn large companies, division and product line managers do. Even here, top management sets general \npricing objectives and policies and often approves lower management\u2019s proposals.\nWhere pricing is a key competitive factor, companies often establish a pricing department to set, \nor assist others in setting, appropriate prices. This department reports to the marketing department, \nthe finance department, or top management. Others who influence pricing include sales managers, \nproduction managers, finance managers, and accountants. In B2B settings, pricing performance tends \nto improve when pricing authority is spread horizontally across the sales, marketing, and finance \nunits and when there is a balance in centralizing and delegating that authority between individual \nsalespeople and teams and central management.3\nMany companies do not handle pricing well and fall back on \u201cstrategies\u201d such as \u201cWe calculate \nour costs and add our industry\u2019s traditional margins.\u201d Other common mistakes are not revising prices \noften enough to capitalize on market changes; setting prices independently of the rest of the marketing \nprogram, rather than as an intrinsic element of market-positioning strategy; and not varying prices \nenough for different product items, market segments, distribution channels, and purchase occasions.\nFor any organization, effectively designing and implementing pricing strategies requires a thor -\nough understanding of buyers\u2019 pricing psychology and a systematic approach to setting, adapting, and \nchanging prices.\nConsumer Psychology and Pricing\nMany economists traditionally assumed that consumers were \u201cprice takers\u201d who accepted prices at \nface value or as a given. Marketers, however, recognize that consumers often actively process price \ninformation, interpreting it in the context of prior purchasing experience, formal communication \n(advertising, sales calls, and brochures), informal communication (friends, colleagues, or family mem -\nbers), point-of-purchase or online resources, and other factors.4\nPurchase decisions are based on how consumers perceive prices and what they consider the cur -\nrent actual price to be\u2014 not on the marketer\u2019s stated price. Customers may have a lower price threshold, \nbelow which prices signal inferior or unacceptable quality, and an upper price threshold, above which \nprices are prohibitive and the product seems not to be worth the money. Different people interpret \nprices in different ways.\nConsider the consumer psychology involved in buying a simple pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Why \ndoes a black T-shirt for women that looks pretty ordinary cost $275 from Armani but only $14.90 \nfrom the Gap and $7.90 from Swedish discount clothing chain H&M? Customers who purchase the \nArmani T-shirt are paying for a more stylishly cut T-shirt made of 70 percent nylon, 25 percent poly -\nester, and 5 percent elastane with a \u201cMade in Italy\u201d label from a luxury brand known for suits, hand -\nbags, and evening gowns that sell for thousands of dollars. The Gap and H&M shirts are made mainly \nof cotton. Choices abound for pants to go with these T-shirts. The Gap sells its \u201cOriginal Khakis\u201d for \n$44.50, whereas Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s classic button-fly chinos cost $70. But that\u2019s a comparative \nbargain compared to Michael Bastian\u2019s plain khakis for $480 or Giorgio Armani\u2019s for $595. High-priced \ndesigner jeans may use expensive fabrics such as cotton gabardine and require hours of meticulous \nhand-stitching to create a distinctive design, but equally important are the image and the sense of \nexclusivity they come with.5\nUnderstanding how consumers arrive at their perceptions of prices is an important marketing \n priority. Here we consider three topics pertaining to the psychology of pricing\u2014reference prices, \nimage pricing, and pricing cues.\nReference Prices.  Although consumers may have fairly good knowledge of price ranges, surprisingly \nfew can accurately recall specific prices. When examining products, however, they often employ reference \nprices , comparing an observed price to an internal reference price they remember or an external frame", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5020, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "272a4274-91d2-4dc0-aaf0-cc6fdea354f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "272a4274-91d2-4dc0-aaf0-cc6fdea354f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2429378-eba7-437f-aa28-4067dfc21e30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "cf5a493b801488eaa267f92b53d9e8968b357e65039d420991e5fc62e6e16127", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09f98966-5b98-44d5-8a78-489dc9ab1675", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "b5e1c5ae896791bc307d4e444a1e599ec6c32643eb1d903e92d47acccea80da7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc7f1b1a-5ecc-4d84-bc78-b619f09d2188", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c109240ccfa2d9dddee1f56989ac50694522e63d63abddc6082f883cb17a8a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "242 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\n>> Abercrombie & \nFitch\u2019s consumer image \nenables it to charge \nhigher prices than many \nof its rivals.\nSource: Mark Waugh/Alamy Stock Photo\nof reference such as a posted \u201cregular retail price.\u201d6 Possible reference prices include \u201cfair price\u201d (what con -\nsumers feel the product should cost), typical price, last price paid, upper-bound price (reservation price, \nor the maximum most consumers would pay), lower-bound price (lower price threshold, or the minimum \nmost consumers would pay), competitor price, expected future price, and usual discounted price.7\nSellers often attempt to manipulate reference prices. For example, a seller can situate its product \namong expensive competitors to imply that it belongs in the same class. Department stores will dis -\nplay women\u2019s apparel in separate departments differentiated by price; dresses in the more expensive \ndepartment are assumed to be of better quality.8 Marketers also encourage reference-price thinking \nby stating a high manufacturer\u2019s suggested price, indicating that the price was much higher originally, \nor by pointing to a competitor\u2019s high price.\nWhen consumers evoke one or more of these frames of reference, their perceived price can vary \nfrom the stated price. Research has found that unpleasant surprises\u2014when perceived price is lower than \nthe stated price\u2014can have a greater impact on purchase likelihood than pleasant surprises.9 Consumer \nexpectations can also play a key role in price response. On internet auction sites such as eBay, when con -\nsumers know similar goods will be available in future auctions, they will bid less in the current auction.10\nClever marketers try to frame the price to signal the best value possible. For example, a relatively \nexpensive item can look less expensive if the price is broken into smaller units, such as a $600 annual \nmembership for \u201c$50 a month,\u201d even though the totals are the same.11\nImage Pricing.  Many consumers use price as an indicator of quality. Image pricing  is especially \neffective with ego-sensitive products such as perfumes, expensive cars, and designer clothing. A $100 \nbottle of perfume might contain $10 worth of scent, but gift givers pay $100 to communicate their \nhigh regard for the recipient.\nPrice and quality perceptions of cars interact. Higher-priced cars are perceived to possess high \nquality. Higher-quality cars are likewise perceived to be higher priced than they actually are. When \ninformation about true quality is available, price becomes a less significant indicator of quality. When \nthis information is not available, price acts as a signal of quality.\nSome brands adopt exclusivity and scarcity to signify uniqueness and justify premium pricing. \nLuxury-goods makers of watches, jewelry, perfume, and other products often emphasize exclusivity \nin their communication messages and channel strategies. High prices may actually increase demand \namong luxury-goods customers who desire uniqueness, because they then believe fewer other custom -\ners can afford the products.12\nTo maintain its air of exclusivity, Ferrari deliberately restricts sales of its iconic, $200,000-plus \nItalian sports car to below 7,000 despite growing demand in China, the Middle East, and the United \nStates. But even exclusivity and status can vary by customer.

Pricing cues  are also important in the psychology of pricing. Many sellers believe \nprices should end in an odd number. Customers perceive an item priced at $299 to be in the $200 rather \nthan the $300 range; they tend to process prices \u201cleft to right\u201d rather than by rounding. Price encoding \nin this fashion is important if there is a mental price break at the higher, rounded price.\nAnother explanation for the popularity of \u201c9\u201d endings is that they suggest a discount or bargain, \nso if a company wants a high-price image, it should probably avoid the odd-ending tactic. One\u00a0study \nshowed that demand actually increased when the price of a dress rose from $34 to $39 but was \nunchanged when it rose from $34 to $44.14\nPrices that end with 0 and 5 are also popular and are thought to be easier for consumers to process \nand retrieve from memory. \u201cSale\u201d signs next to prices spur demand, but only if not overused. Thus total \ncategory sales are highest when some\u2014but not all\u2014items in a category have sale signs; past a certain \npoint, sale signs may cause total category sales to fall.15\nPricing cues such as sale signs and prices that end in 9 are more influential when consumers\u2019 price \nknowledge is poor; when they purchase the item infrequently or are new to the category; and when \nproduct designs vary over time, prices vary seasonally, or quality or sizes vary across stores.16 They \nare less effective the more they are used. Limited availability (for example, \u201cthree days only\u201d) also can \nspur sales among consumers actively shopping for a product.17\nSetting the Price\nA firm must set a price for the first time when it develops a new product, when it introduces its regular \nproduct into a new distribution channel or geographic area, and when it enters bids on new contract \nwork. The firm must decide where to position its product on quality and price.18\nMost markets have three to five price points or tiers. Marriott Hotels is good at developing different \nbrands or variations of brands for different price points: JW Marriott (highest price), Marriott Marquis \n(high price), Marriott (high-medium price), Renaissance (medium-high price), Courtyard (medium \nprice), TownePlace Suites (medium-low price), and Fairfield Inn (low price). Firms devise their branding \nstrategies to help convey to consumers the price\u2013quality tiers of their products or services.19\nThe firm must consider many factors in setting its pricing policy. The pricing process involves six \nmain steps: defining the pricing objective; determining demand; estimating costs; analyzing competi -\ntors\u2019 costs, prices, and offers; selecting a pricing method; and setting the final price.<< Despite booming \ndemand, Ferrari limits \nproduction and the \n number of sports cars \nthat it sells to maintain \nthe brand\u2019s exclusivity.\nSource: Ian Shaw/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3057, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a24b078-9394-4313-b70a-26d7f02a32e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a24b078-9394-4313-b70a-26d7f02a32e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6193ff9b-71df-45ee-87d0-3ab8833fd0f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "d796f0eb47c0c4163a2f2dfd1456c695aa30488d5f4a00de62d5549a2d684419", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc7f1b1a-5ecc-4d84-bc78-b619f09d2188", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "a04fb84024824abf17f8d297d2615eb94ee75e584d3778919ec25a3ba1879bcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bfdb7b2-8c59-4729-9394-f0d3c2a4428c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b185f386696420c17469aefeb1a08fd96b77eb3ab48f054d7a26ff359152abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "244 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nDEFINING THE PRICING OBJECTIVE\nAn offering\u2019s price is determined by a firm\u2019s overall pricing objective. The clearer a firm\u2019s objective, \nthe easier it is to set price. Four common pricing objectives are current profit, market penetration, \nmarket skimming, and quality leadership.\n\u2022 Short-term profit.  Many companies try to set a price that will maximize current profits . They esti -\nmate the demand and costs associated with alternative prices and choose the price that produces \nmaximum current profit, cash flow, or rate of return on investment. This strategy assumes the firm \nknows its demand and cost functions, but in reality, these are difficult to estimate. Furthermore, in \nemphasizing current performance, the company may sacrifice long-run performance by ignoring \nthe effects of other marketing variables, competitors\u2019 reactions, and legal restraints on price.\n\u2022 Market penetration.  Companies that choose penetration pricing  want to maximize their market \nshare . They believe a higher sales volume will lead to lower unit costs and higher long-run profit, so \nthey set a very low price, assuming the market is price sensitive. Texas Instruments famously prac -\nticed this market-penetration pricing for years. The company would build a large plant, set its price as \nlow as possible, win a large market share, experience falling costs, and cut its price further as costs fell.\nThe following conditions favor adopting a market-penetration pricing strategy: (1) the market \nis highly price sensitive, and a low price stimulates market growth; (2) production and distribu -\ntion costs fall with accumulated production experience; and (3) a low price discourages actual \nand potential competition.\n\u2022 Market skimming.  Companies unveiling a new technology favor setting high prices to maximize \nmarket skimming . In market skimming , a company is setting a relatively high price in an attempt \nto \u201cskim the cream\u201d off the market by making the offering affordable only to customers with the \nhighest willingness to pay. Sony has been a frequent practitioner of market-skimming pricing, in \nwhich prices start high and slowly drop over time.\nMarket skimming is beneficial under the following conditions: (1) a sufficient number of \nbuyers signal a high current demand; (2) the high initial price does not attract more competitors \nto the market; and (3) the high price communicates the image of a superior product.\n\u2022 Quality leadership.  A company might aim to be the quality leader  in the market. To maintain quality \nleadership, a company must charge a relatively high price in order to be able to invest in research and \ndevelopment, production, and service delivery. Brands such as Starbucks, Aveda, Victoria\u2019s Secret, \nBMW, and Viking have positioned themselves as quality leaders in their categories, combining quality, \nluxury, and premium prices with an intensely loyal customer base. Grey\u00a0Goose and Absolut carved \nout a super-premium niche in the essentially odorless, colorless, and tasteless vodka category through \nclever on-premise and off-premise marketing that made the brands seem hip and exclusive.\nNonprofit and public organizations may have other pricing objectives. A university aims for par -\ntial cost recovery, knowing that it must rely on private gifts and public grants to cover its remaining \ncosts. A nonprofit hospital may aim for full cost recovery in its pricing. A nonprofit theater company \nmay price its productions to fill the maximum number of seats. A social service agency may set a \nservice price geared to client income.\nWhatever the specific objective, businesses that use price as a strategic tool will profit more than \nthose that simply let costs or the market determine their pricing. For art museums, which earn an aver -\nage of only 5 percent of their revenues from admission charges, pricing can send a message that affects \ntheir public image and the amount of donations and sponsorships they receive.\nDETERMINING DEMAND\nEach price will lead to a different level of demand and have a different impact on a company\u2019s market -\ning objectives. The normally inverse relationship between price and demand is captured in a demand \ncurve: The higher the price, the lower the demand. For prestige goods, the demand curve sometimes \nslopes upward. Some consumers take the higher price to signify a better product. However, if the \nprice is too high, demand may fall.\nTo estimate the demand for a company\u2019s offering, marketers need to know how responsive, or elas -\ntic, demand is to a change in price.

If demand changes considerably in response to changes in \nprice, it is elastic .\nThe higher the elasticity, the greater the volume growth resulting from a 1 percent price reduction. \nIf demand is elastic, sellers will consider lowering the price to produce more total revenue. This makes \nsense as long as the costs of producing and selling more units do not increase disproportionately.\nPrice elasticity of demand depends on the magnitude and direction of the contemplated price \nchange. It may be negligible with a small price change and substantial with a large price change. It \nmay differ for a price cut than for a price increase, and there may be a price indifference band  within \nwhich price changes have little or no effect.\nLong-run price elasticity may differ from short-run elasticity. Buyers may continue to buy from \na current supplier after a price increase but eventually switch suppliers; here demand is more elastic \nin the long run than in the short run. Or the reverse may happen: Buyers may drop a supplier after a \nprice increase but return later. The distinction between short-run and long-run elasticity means that \nsellers will not know the total effect of a price change until time passes.\nGenerally speaking, price elasticity is low when (1) the product is distinctive and there are few or \nno substitutes or competitors; (2) consumers do not readily notice the higher price; (3) consumers are \nslow to change their buying habits; (4) consumers think the higher prices are justified by factors such \nas the cost of creating the product, product scarcity, and government taxation; (5) the expenditure is \na smaller part of the buyer\u2019s total income or of the total cost of the end product; and (6) part or all of \nthe cost is borne by another party.21\nOne comprehensive review of a 40-year period of academic research on price elasticity found that \nthe average price elasticity across all products, markets, and time periods studied was \u20132.62.22 In other \nwords, a 1 percent decrease in prices led to a 2.62 percent increase in sales. Furthermore, price elasticity \nwas higher for durable goods than for other goods and was higher for products in the introduction/  \ngrowth stages of the product life cycle than for products in the mature/decline stages. Finally, promo -\ntional price elasticities were higher than actual price elasticities in the short run (although the reverse \nwas true in the long run).\nESTIMATING COSTS\nDemand sets a ceiling on the price the company can charge for its product. Costs set the floor. The \ncompany wants to charge a price that covers its cost of producing, distributing, and selling the prod -\nuct, including a fair return for its effort and risk.\nFixed, Variable, and Total Costs.  A company\u2019s costs take two forms: fixed and variable. \nFixed costs  are costs that do not vary with production level or sales revenue. A company must pay \nbills each month for rent, heat, interest, salaries, and so on, regardless of output.\nVariable costs  vary directly with the level of production. For example, each tablet computer \nproduced by Samsung incurs the cost of plastic and glass, microprocessor chips and other electronics, \nand packaging. These costs tend to be constant per unit produced, but they\u2019re called variable because \ntheir total varies with the number of units produced.\nTotal costs  consist of the sum of the fixed and variable costs for any given level of production. \nAverage cost  is the cost per unit at that level of production; it equals total costs divided by produc -\ntion. Management wants to charge a price that will at least cover the total production costs at a given \nlevel of production.FIGURE 11.1 \nInelastic and Elastic \nDemand\n150 50\nQuantity Demanded per Period105$15\n$10Price\n100\nQuantity Demanded per Period(b) Elastic Demand (a) Inelastic Demand\n$15\n$10", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3958, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38375c01-e075-4833-8124-c2a330eea7cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "38375c01-e075-4833-8124-c2a330eea7cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1fe445b4-cbfb-4e7f-9e65-89471da5d8d6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "95264593b48c3ee2f90a5fc689e2055cc937c8ff5f7f562b5332b13040b9c937", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b2fe9b5-f659-4af3-8abf-5a06dadbeab9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "3eca800a78727a8313def6fb22f9c1aa50fe7f0e6b49b54c060026ab4eed6929", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bd56a52-1dfc-4c40-975c-159d01e7b687", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4fc1448503651f0cc0eb90496fead1c63dd8d856de9e9a01d09f0ee60b2051b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "246 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nTo price intelligently, management needs to know how its costs vary with different levels of pro -\nduction. Take the case in which a company such as Samsung has built a fixed-size plant to produce \n1,000 tablet computers a day. The cost per unit is high if few units are produced per day. As produc -\ntion approaches 1,000 units per day, the average cost falls because the fixed costs are spread over more \nunits. Short-run average cost increases  after 1,000 units, however, because the plant becomes inefficient: \nWorkers must line up for machines, getting in each other\u2019s way, and machines break down more often.\nIf Samsung believes it can sell 2,000 units per day, it should consider building a larger plant. \nThe plant will use more efficient machinery and work arrangements, and the unit cost of producing \n2,000\u00a0tablets per day will be lower than the unit cost of producing 1,000 per day. In fact, a 3,000-  capacity \nplant would be even more efficient, but a 4,000-daily production plant would be less so because of \nincreasing diseconomies of scale: There are too many workers to manage, and paperwork slows things \ndown. A 3,000-daily production plant is the optimal size if demand is strong enough to support this \nlevel of production.\nThere are more costs than those associated with manufacturing. To estimate the real profitability \nof selling to different types of retailers or customers, the manufacturer needs to use activity-based cost \naccounting instead of standard cost accounting.\nExperience Curve Effects.  Suppose Samsung runs a plant that produces 3,000 tablet com -\nputers per day. As the company gains experience producing tablets, its methods improve. Workers \nlearn shortcuts, materials flow more smoothly, and procurement costs fall. The result is that aver -\nage cost falls with accumulated production experience. Thus the average cost of producing the first \n100,000\u00a0tablets is $100 per tablet, but when the company has produced the first 200,000 tablets, the \naverage cost has fallen to $90. After its accumulated production experience doubles again to 400,000, \nthe average cost is $80. This decline in the average cost with accumulated production experience is \ncalled the  experience curve .\nNow suppose three firms compete in this particular tablet market: Samsung, Firm A, and Firm \nB. Samsung is the lowest-cost producer at $80, having produced 400,000 units in the past. If all three \nfirms sell the tablet for $100, Samsung makes a $20 profit per unit, A makes $10 per unit, and B breaks \neven. The smart move for Samsung would be to lower its price to $90. This will drive B out of the \nmarket, and even A may consider leaving. Samsung will pick up the business that would have gone to \nB (and possibly A). Furthermore, price-sensitive customers will enter the market at the lower price. As \nproduction increases beyond 400,000 units, Samsung\u2019s costs will drop still further and faster, more \nthan restoring its profits, even at a price of $90.\nExperience-curve pricing  nevertheless carries major risks. Aggressive pricing might give the \nproduct a cheap image. It also assumes competitors are weak followers. The strategy leads the com -\npany to build more plants to meet demand, but a competitor may choose to innovate with a lower-cost \ntechnology. The market leader is now stuck with the old technology.\nMost experience-curve pricing has focused on manufacturing costs, but all costs can be improved \non, including marketing costs. If three firms are each investing a large sum of money in marketing, the \nfirm that has been doing it longest might achieve the lowest costs. This firm can charge a little less for \nits product and still earn the same return, all other costs being equal.\nANALYZING COMPETITORS\u2019 PRICES\nWithin the range of possible prices identified by market demand and company costs, the firm must \ntake competitors\u2019 costs, prices, and possible reactions into account.

The low-cost operation must be designed and \nlaunched as a moneymaker in its own right, not just as a defensive play.\nSELECTING A PRICING METHOD\nGiven the customers\u2019 demand schedule, the cost function, and competitors\u2019 prices, the company is now \nready to select a pricing method. There are three major considerations in price setting: costs, competi -\ntors, and customers. Costs set a floor for the price. Competitors\u2019 prices and the price of  substitutes \nprovide an orienting point. Customers\u2019 assessment of unique features establishes the price ceiling.\nCompanies select a pricing method that includes one or more of these three considerations. We \nwill examine five price-setting methods: markup pricing, target-rate-of-return pricing, economic-\nvalue-to-customer pricing, competitive pricing, and auction-type pricing.\nMarkup Pricing.  The most elementary pricing method, markup pricing , is to add a standard \nmarkup to the product\u2019s cost. Construction companies submit job bids by estimating the total project \ncost and adding a standard markup for profit. Lawyers and accountants typically price by adding a \nstandard markup on their time and costs.\nSuppose a toaster manufacturer has the following costs and sales expectations:\nVariable cost per unit  $           10\nFixed costs  $300,000\nExpected unit sales       50,000\nThe manufacturer\u2019s unit cost is then given by\nUnit cost=variable cost+fixed cost\nunit sales=$10+$300,00\n50,000=$16\nNow assume the manufacturer wants to earn a 20 percent markup on sales. The manufacturer\u2019s \nmarkup price is given by\nMarkup price=unit cost\n(1-desired return on sales)=$16\n1-0.2=$20\nThe manufacturer will charge dealers $20 per toaster and make a profit of $4 per unit. If deal -\ners want to earn 50 percent on their selling price, they will mark up the toaster 100 percent to $40. \nMarkups are generally higher on seasonal items (to cover the risk of not selling), specialty items, \nslower moving items, items with high storage and handling costs, and demand-inelastic items, such \nas prescription drugs.\nDoes the use of standard markups make logical sense? Generally, no. After all, buyers often do not \ncare about a manufacturer\u2019s costs. In fact, any pricing method that ignores current demand, perceived \nvalue, and competition is not likely to lead to the optimal price. Still, markup pricing remains popular. \nFirst, sellers can determine costs much more easily than they can estimate demand. By tying the price \nto cost, sellers simplify the pricing task. Second, when all firms in the industry use this pricing method, \nprices tend to be similar and price competition is minimized. Third, many people feel cost-plus pricing \nis fairer to both buyers and sellers. Sellers do not take advantage of buyers when the latter\u2019s demand \nbecomes acute, and sellers earn a fair return on investment.\nTarget-Rate-of-Return Pricing.  In target-rate-of-return pricing  (or target-return pricing), \nthe firm starts with a rate-of-return objective (e.g., 10 percent of sales revenue) and then sets a price \nthat will yield the desired rate of return. Because it does not take into account customer demand and \ncompetitive offerings, target-rate-of-return pricing is often used in regulated industries. For example, \npublic utilities, which need to make a fair return on investment, often use this method.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4165, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39c82189-0461-440c-a847-5d261165559c": {"__data__": {"id_": "39c82189-0461-440c-a847-5d261165559c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00249d5f-7d50-4a31-9d56-5c2cf8e2eca0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "0df64a973a3168413e5a0cba6131500852d460fb090701ef2608412f148a7dd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff02f4f4-fbf4-4a3b-a3d3-353824bf7d24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "e1bf135663d4863c8d6e0a21ab1ffb4933d7c0010b77a4d5708b3e07a4256927", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4247f79e-f302-4d00-b56a-a3ba09a369a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "717aa172c19e1919524ac321ececcecdee90c1deefb7c97a5bbad82d058b3c41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "248 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nSuppose the toaster manufacturer has invested $1 million in the business and wants to set a price to \nearn a 20 percent ROI, specifically $200,000. The target-return price is given by the following formula:\n Target@return price=unit cost+desired return*invested capital\nunit sales\n =$16+.20*$1,000,000\n50,000=$20\nThe manufacturer will realize this 20 percent ROI, provided its costs and estimated sales turn \nout to be accurate. But what if sales don\u2019t reach 50,000 units? The manufacturer can prepare a break-\neven chart to learn what would happen at other sales levels (see Figure 11.2). Fixed costs are $300,000 \nregardless of sales volume. Variable costs, not shown in the figure, rise with volume. Total costs \nequal the sum of fixed and variable costs. The total revenue curve starts at zero and rises with each \nunit sold.\nThe total revenue and total cost curves cross at 30,000 units. This is the break-even volume. We \ncan verify it by the following formula:\nBreak@even volume=fixed cost\n(price-variable cost)=$300,000\n$20-$10=30,000\nThe manufacturer, of course, is hoping the market will buy 50,000 units at $20, in which case it will \nearn $200,000 on its $1 million investment; however, much depends on price elasticity and competi -\ntors\u2019 prices. Unfortunately, target-return pricing tends to ignore these considerations. The manufac -\nturer needs to consider different prices and estimate their probable impacts on sales volume and profits.\nEconomic-Value-to-Customer Pricing.  An increasing number of companies now base \ntheir price on the customer\u2019s economic value. Economic-value-to-customer pricing  takes into \naccount a host of inputs, such as the buyer\u2019s image of the product performance, the channel deliver -\nables, the warranty quality, customer support, and softer attributes such as the supplier\u2019s reputation, \ntrustworthiness, and esteem. Companies must deliver the value promised by their value proposi -\ntion, and the customer must perceive this value. Firms use the other marketing program elements, \nsuch as advertising, the sales force, and the internet, to communicate and enhance perceived value in \nbuyers\u2019\u00a0minds.\nA seller can successfully charge a higher price than competitors if it can convince customers that \nit offers the lowest total cost of ownership. Marketers often treat the service elements in a product \noffering as sales incentives rather than as value-enhancing augmentations for which they can charge. \nIn fact, one of the most common mistakes manufacturers tend to made is to offer all sorts of services \nto differentiate their products without charging for them.\nCaterpillar uses perceived value to set prices on its construction equipment. It might price  \nits tractor at $100,000, even though a similar competitor\u2019s tractor might be priced at $90,000.  \nFIGURE 11.2 \nBreak-Even chart \nfor\u00a0Determining \nTarget- return Price \nand Break-Even \nVolume\n40 508001,000\n600\n400\n2001,200Dollars (in thousands)\n30 20 10 0\nSales Volume in Units (thousands)Fixed costTotal costTarget pro\ufb01tTotal revenue\nBreak-even point", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3094, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4247f79e-f302-4d00-b56a-a3ba09a369a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4247f79e-f302-4d00-b56a-a3ba09a369a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "78422e52-491e-4ec5-8179-420f1919c30c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "19134bf231bb712ac0e7894530da6dbe7309e5867f927b6095bbaee15f8a27be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "39c82189-0461-440c-a847-5d261165559c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "0df64a973a3168413e5a0cba6131500852d460fb090701ef2608412f148a7dd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5785e6f8-021b-4c09-8c0e-56a94818fdde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b23ca23fc428876972c8156df58f5c2ce66e1eb888f7b2d4795aa525da9edac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 11    |  MANAGING  PrIcING AND  SALES  PrOMOTIONS  249\nWhen a prospective customer asks a Caterpillar dealer why he or she should pay $10,000 more for the \n Caterpillar tractor, the dealer explains as follows:\n$ 90,000 is the tractor\u2019s price if it is only equivalent to the competitor\u2019s tractor\n$  7,000 is the price premium for Caterpillar\u2019s superior durability\n$  6,000 is the price premium for Caterpillar\u2019s superior reliability\n$  5,000 is the price premium for Caterpillar\u2019s superior service\n$  2,000 is the price premium for Caterpillar\u2019s longer warranty on parts\n$110,000 is the normal price to cover Caterpillar\u2019s superior value\n-$ 10,000 Discount\n$100,000 final price\nThe Caterpillar dealer is able to show that although customers are asked to pay a $10,000 premium \nfor this tractor, they are actually getting $20,000 extra value!

Some care only about price. But there is also typically a segment that cares about quality. \nUmbrellas are essential during the three months of near-nonstop monsoon rain in Indian cities such as \nMumbai, and the makers of Stag umbrellas there found themselves in a bitter price war with cheaper \nChinese competitors. After realizing that they were sacrificing quality too much, Stag\u2019s managers \ndecided to increase quality with new colors, new designs, and features such as built-in high-power \nflashlights and prerecorded music. Despite higher prices, sales of the improved Stag umbrellas  actually \nincreased.27\nThe key to economic-value-to-customer pricing is to deliver more unique value than competitors \nand to demonstrate this to prospective buyers. Thus, a company needs to fully understand the cus -\ntomer\u2019s decision-making process. For example, Goodyear found it hard to command a price premium \nfor its more expensive new tires, despite innovative features to extend tread life. Because consumers \nhad no reference price to compare tires, they tended to gravitate toward the lowest-priced offerings. \nGoodyear\u2019s solution was to price its models on the basis of expected miles of wear, rather than their \ntechnical product features, making product comparisons easier.28\nCompetitive Pricing.  In competitive pricing  (or going-rate pricing), the firm bases its price \nlargely on competitors\u2019 prices. All firms in industries that sell a commodity such as steel, paper, or fer -\ntilizer normally charge the same price. Smaller firms \u201cfollow the leader,\u201d changing their prices when the \nmarket leader\u2019s prices change, rather than when their own demand or costs change. Some may charge \na small premium or discount, but they preserve the difference. Thus, minor gasoline retailers usually \ncharge a few cents less per gallon than the major oil companies, without letting the difference increase \nor decrease. Competitive pricing is quite popular. Where costs vary and/or are difficult to measure, \nwhen the demand fluctuates, or when competitive response is uncertain, firms feel competitive pricing \nis a good solution because they believe it reflects the industry\u2019s collective wisdom.\nAuction Pricing.  Auction pricing  is growing more popular, especially with scores of electronic \nmarketplaces selling everything from pigs to used cars, as firms dispose of excess inventories or used \ngoods. Here are the three major types of auctions and their separate pricing procedures:29\n\u2022 English auctions (ascending bids)  have one seller and many buyers. On sites such as eBay and \nAmazon.com, the seller puts up an item and bidders raise their offer prices until the top price is \nreached. The highest bidder gets the item. English auctions are used today for selling antiques, \ncattle, real estate, and used equipment and vehicles. Kodak and Nortel sold hundreds of patents \nfor wireless and digital imaging via auctions, raising hundreds of millions of dollars.30\n\u2022 Dutch auctions (descending bids)  feature one seller and many buyers or one buyer and many \nsellers. In the first kind, an auctioneer announces a high price for a product and then slowly \ndecreases the price until a bidder accepts. In the other, the buyer announces something he or she \nwants to buy, and potential sellers compete to offer the lowest price. SAP Ariba runs business-to-\nbusiness auctions to help companies acquire low-priced items as varied as steel, fats, oils, name \nbadges, pickles, plastic bottles, solvents, cardboard, and even legal and janitorial work.31\n\u2022 Sealed-bid auctions  let would-be suppliers submit only one bid without any knowledge of the \nother bids. The U.S. and other governments often use this method to procure supplies or grant \nlicenses. A supplier will not bid below its cost but cannot bid too high for fear of losing the job. \nThe net effect of these two pulls is the bid\u2019s expected profit .32\nTo buy equipment for its drug researchers, Pfizer uses online reverse auctions in which suppliers \nsubmit the lowest price they are willing to be paid. If the increased savings that a buying firm obtains \nin an online auction translate into decreased margins for an incumbent supplier, however, the sup -\nplier may feel the firm is opportunistically squeezing out price concessions. Online auctions with a \nlarge number of bidders can result in greater overall satisfaction for both parties, more positive future \nexpectations, and fewer perceptions of opportunism.33\nSETTING THE FINAL PRICE\nPricing methods narrow the range from which the company must select its final price.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4727, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0695d557-5891-4eac-8dda-4146376688c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0695d557-5891-4eac-8dda-4146376688c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eeaf7ce5-aacf-4790-b49e-df1ab3ea2b32", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "3f7ed358f3893cabb3ac3b432173b7137440b92bc4bd4e5a36466fb00f4ffc5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5785e6f8-021b-4c09-8c0e-56a94818fdde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "449d112684b3a55cfd27444ac6573c25117264ff21c0aa0cf57922f58169fc5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bcb6cceb-c088-40a1-9d59-135e41eb3474", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4013f741d08d96126d5630ad4f4a4635197ded3955519f5f230d01db5b684d5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The U.S. and other governments often use this method to procure supplies or grant \nlicenses.

Merchants are adjusting process based on inventory levels, item velocity \n(how fast an item sells), competitors\u2019 pricing, and advertising. Even sports teams are adjusting ticket \nprices to reflect the popularity of the competitor and the timing of the game. Online merchants that \nsell their products on Amazon.com are changing their prices on an hourly or even minute-by-minute \nbasis, in part so they can secure the top spot on search results.\nPrice discrimination  occurs when a company sells a product or service at two or more prices \nthat do not reflect a proportional difference in costs. In first-degree price discrimination , the seller charges \neach customer a separate price, depending on the intensity of his or her demand. In second-degree price \ndiscrimination , the seller charges less to buyers of larger volumes. With certain services such as cell \nphone service, however, tiered pricing results in consumers actually paying more  with higher levels \nof usage.\nIn third-degree price discrimination , the seller charges different amounts to different consumer seg -\nments, as in the following cases:34\n\u2022 Customer-segment pricing.  Different customer segments pay different prices for the same \nproduct or service. For example, museums often charge a lower admission fee to students and \nsenior citizens. When online travel agency Orbitz found that people using Apple Mac computers \nspent as much as 30 percent more a night on hotels, it began to show them different\u2014and some -\ntimes costlier\u2014travel options than Windows users saw. Orbitz also considers a user\u2019s location \nand history on the site, as a well as a hotel\u2019s overall popularity and promotions.35\n\u2022 Product-form pricing.  Different versions of the product are priced differently, but not in \nproportion to their costs. Evian prices a 2-liter bottle of its mineral water as low as $1 but sells \n5\u00a0ounces of the same water in a moisturizer spray for as much as $12.\n\u2022 Channel pricing.  Coca-Cola carries a different price depending on whether the consumer pur -\nchases it from a fine restaurant, a fast-food restaurant, or a vending machine.\n\u2022 Location pricing.  The same product is priced differently at different locations, even though the \ncost of offering it is the same at all locations. A theater varies its seat prices according to audience \npreferences for different locations. Some firms store computer IP addresses and zip codes and use \ntheir proximity to a competitor\u2019s store to adjust their prices.\n\u2022 Time pricing.  Prices vary by season, day, or hour. Restaurants charge \u201cearly bird\u201d customers \nless, and some hotels charge less on weekends. Retail prices for roses increase by as much as \n200\u00a0  percent in the lead-up to Valentine\u2019s Day.\nThe airline and hospitality industries use yield management systems and yield pricing, by which \nthey offer discounted but limited early purchases, higher prices for late purchases, and the lowest rates \nfor unsold inventory just before it expires. Airlines charge different fares to passengers on the same \nflight, depending on the seating class; the time of day (morning or night coach); the day of the week \n(workday or weekend); the season; the person\u2019s employer, past business, or status (youth, military, \nsenior citizen); and so on.

In \n product-mix pricing , the firm searches for a set of prices that maximize profits on the total mix. \nThe process is challenging, because the various products have demand and cost interrelationships \nand are subject to different degrees of competition. We can distinguish six main situations calling for \nproduct-mix pricing: loss-leader pricing, optional-feature pricing, captive-product pricing, two-part \npricing, by-product pricing, and product-bundling pricing.\n\u2022 Loss-leader pricing.  A company can set the price of a specific product or service in a way that \nmaximizes the profitability of its entire product line. A common product-line pricing approach \nis loss-leader pricing . Supermarkets and department stores often drop the price on well-known \nbrands to stimulate additional store traffic. This approach pays if the revenue on the additional \nsales compensates for the lower margins on the loss-leader items. Manufacturers of brands that \nretailers use as loss leaders typically object, because this practice can dilute the brand image and \nbring complaints from retailers who charge the list price. Manufacturers have tried to keep inter -\nmediaries from using loss-leader pricing by lobbying for retail-price-maintenance laws, but these \nlaws have been revoked.\n\u2022 Optional-feature pricing.  Many companies offer optional products, features, and services with \ntheir main product. The pricing of options is a sticky problem, because companies must decide \nwhich to include in the standard price and which to offer separately. Many restaurants price their \nbeverages high and their food low. The food revenue covers costs, and the beverages\u2014especially \nliquor\u2014produce the profit. This explains why servers often press hard to get customers to order \ndrinks. Other restaurants price their liquor low and their food high to draw in a drinking crowd.\n\u2022 Captive pricing.  Some products require the use of ancillary or captive products. Manufacturers \nof razors often price them low and set high markups on razor blades. Movie theaters and concert \nvenues often make more from concessions and merchandise sales than from ticket receipts.36 \nVerizon may give a free cell phone to the person who commits to buying two years of phone \nservice. If the captive product is priced too high in the aftermarket, however, counterfeiting and \nsubstitutions can erode sales. Consumers now can buy cartridge refills for their printers from \ndiscount suppliers and save 20 percent to 30 percent off the manufacturer\u2019s price.\n\u2022 Two-part pricing.  Service firms engage in two-part pricing, consisting of a fixed fee plus a vari -\nable usage fee. Cell phone users may have to pay a minimum monthly fee plus charges for calls \nthat exceed their allotted minutes. Amusement parks charge an admission fee plus fees for rides \nover a certain minimum. The service firm faces a problem similar to captive-product pricing\u2014\nnamely, how much to charge for the basic service and how much for the variable usage. The fixed \nfee should be low enough to induce purchase; profit can then come from the usage fees.\n\u2022 By-product pricing.  The production of certain goods\u2014meats, petroleum products, and other \nchemicals\u2014often yields by-products that should be priced on their value. Any income earned on \nthe by-products will make it easier for the company to charge a lower price for its main product \nif competition forces it to do so. Formed in 1855, Australia\u2019s CSR was originally named  Colonial \nSugar Refining Company and forged its early reputation as a sugar company. The company began \nto sell by-products of its sugar cane; waste sugar cane fiber was used to manufacture wallboard. \nToday, through product development and acquisition, the renamed CSR has become one of the \ntop 10\u00a0companies in Australia selling building and construction materials.\n\u2022 Product-bundling pricing.  Sellers often bundle products and features.37 Pure bundling  occurs \nwhen a firm offers its products only as a bundle. Providers of aftermarket products for auto -\nmobiles increasingly are bundling their offerings in customizable three-in-one and four-in-one \nprograms, especially second-tier products such as tire-and-wheel protection and paintless dent \nrepair. A talent agency might insist that an in-demand actor can be signed to a film only if the film \ncompany also accepts other talent, such as directors or writers, that the agency represents.

One is excess capacity: The firm needs addi -\ntional business and cannot generate it through increased sales effort, product improvement, or other \nmeasures. Companies sometimes initiate price cuts in a drive to dominate the market through lower \ncosts. Either the company starts with lower costs than its competitors, or it initiates price cuts in the \nhope of gaining market share and lower costs.\nCutting prices to keep customers or beat competitors often encourages customers to demand \nprice concessions, however, and trains salespeople to offer them.40 A price-cutting strategy can lead \nto other possible drawbacks, such as consumers assuming quality is low. Furthermore, low price buys \nmarket share but not market loyalty\u2014the same customers will shift to any lower-priced firm that \ncomes along. In addition, competitors might respond by lowering their prices even more, triggering a \nprice war. There is also the possibility that higher-priced competitors will match the firm\u2019s lower prices \nbut will have greater staying power because of lower cost structure.\nCustomers often question the motivation behind price changes.41 They may assume that the item \nis about to be replaced by a new model, the item is faulty and is not selling well, the firm is in financial \ntrouble, the price will come down even further, or the quality has been reduced. The firm must moni -\ntor these attributions carefully.\nINITIATING PRICE INCREASES\nA successful price increase can raise profits considerably. If the company\u2019s profit margin is 3 percent \nof sales, a 1 percent price increase will increase profits by 33 percent if sales volume is unaffected. \nThus, if a company charged $10, sold 100 units, and had costs of $970, it generated a profit of $30, or \n3 percent on sales. By raising its price by 10 cents (a 1 percent price increase), it could boost its profits \nby 33 percent, assuming the same sales volume.\nA major circumstance provoking price increases is cost inflation , wherein rising costs unmatched \nby productivity gains squeeze profit margins and lead companies to regular rounds of price increases. \nCompanies often raise their prices by more than the cost increase in anticipation of further inflation \nor government price controls, a practice called anticipatory pricing . Another factor leading to price \nincreases is high demand that exceeds a company\u2019s production capabilities. When a company cannot \nsupply all its customers, it can raise its prices, ration supplies, or both.\nAlthough there is always a chance that a price increase can convey some positive meanings to \ncustomers\u2014for example, that the item is \u201chot\u201d and represents an unusually good value\u2014consumers \ngenerally dislike higher prices. In passing price increases on to consumers, the company must avoid \nlooking like a price gouger. Coca-Cola\u2019s proposed smart vending machines that would raise prices as \ntemperatures rose and Amazon\u2019s dynamic pricing experiment that varied prices by purchase occa -\nsion both became front-page news. The more similar the products or offerings from a company, the \nmore likely consumers are to interpret any pricing differences as unfair. Product customization and \ndifferentiation, as well as communications that clarify differences, are thus critical.42\nSeveral techniques help avoid sticker shock and a hostile consumer reaction when prices rise. One is \nmaintaining a sense of fairness, such as by giving consumers advance notice so they can do forward buying or \nshop around. Sharp price increases also need to be explained in understandable terms. Making low-  visibility \nprice moves first is also a good technique. Eliminating discounts, increasing minimum order sizes, and cur -\ntailing production of low-margin products are examples. And contracts or bids for long-term  projects should \ncontain escalator clauses based on such factors as increases in recognized national price indexes.\nRESPONDING TO COMPETITORS\u2019 PRICE CHANGES\nThe introduction or change of any price can provoke a response from customers, competitors, dis -\ntributors, suppliers, and even government. Competitors are most likely to react when the number of \nfirms in the category is low, the product is homogeneous, and buyers are highly informed.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4689, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80119a9b-514d-44fd-88af-f30be1a390d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "80119a9b-514d-44fd-88af-f30be1a390d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "69fde07b-ab98-4ab6-ac14-c8ddfd68f656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "9453e8443faf825d35143c5fb4212c2b19a80ecc52f0debf76e7303396d62d1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "517684b9-9f35-4417-a2c9-ba0ae0eb8c16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "806bb2ccf61e7ebe36af2341c0d23466969ef84dd05be0752268cfeeaa56570b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13d01bad-4976-4564-85fb-492fe2d30328", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9ec4a8d510926a59ec7352ec00bf5156c03d020df563d9e92bcb0c35b75bd3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "254 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nHow can a firm anticipate a competitor\u2019s reactions? One way is to assume the competitor reacts in \nthe standard way to a price being set or changed. Another is to assume that the competitor treats each \nprice difference or change as a fresh challenge and reacts according to self-interest at the time. Now \nthe company will need to research the competitor\u2019s current financial situation, recent sales, customer \nloyalty, and corporate objectives. If the competitor has a market share objective, it is likely to match \nprice differences or changes.43 If it has a profit-maximization objective, it may react by increasing its \nadvertising budget or improving product quality.\nThe problem is complicated because the competitor can put different interpretations on lowered \nprices or a price cut: that the company is trying to steal the market, that it is doing poorly and trying \nto boost its sales, or that it wants the whole industry to reduce prices to stimulate total demand. When \nWalmart began to run ads claiming lower prices than Publix, the regional supermarket chain dropped \nits prices below Walmart\u2019s on roughly 500 essential items and launched its own advertising campaign \nin retaliation.44\nHow should a firm respond to a competitor\u2019s price cut? It depends on the situation. A firm needs \nto consider the following: (1) Why did the competitor change the price? To steal the market, to utilize \nexcess capacity, to meet changing cost conditions, or to lead an industry-wide price change? (2) Does \nthe competitor plan to make the price change temporary or permanent? (3) What will happen to the \ncompany\u2019s market share and profits if it does not respond? Are other companies going to respond? \n(4)\u00a0What are the competitors\u2019 and other firms\u2019 likely responses to each possible reaction?\nMarket leaders often face aggressive price cutting by smaller firms trying to build market share. \nUsing price, T-Mobile attacked AT&T and Verizon, AMD has attacked Intel, and Dollar Shave Club has \nattacked Gillette. Market leaders also face lower-priced store brands. Three possible responses to low-\ncost competitors are to further differentiate the product or service, to introduce a low-cost venture, \nor to reinvent oneself as a low-cost player.45 The right strategy depends on the ability of the firm to \ngenerate more demand or cut costs.\nAn extended analysis of alternatives may not always be feasible when the attack occurs. The com -\npany may have to react decisively within hours or days, especially where prices change with some \nfrequency and it is important to react quickly, such as in the meatpacking, lumber, or oil industries. \nIt would make better sense to anticipate possible competitors\u2019 price changes and prepare contingent \nresponses.\nManaging Incentives\nIncentives  are sales promotion tools, mostly short-term, designed to stimulate quicker or greater \npurchase of particular products or services by consumers or the trade.46\nINCENTIVES AS A MARKETING DEVICE\nSales promotion expenditure increased as a percentage of budget expenditure for a number of years, \nwith the fastest-growing area being digital coupons and discounts, redeemed via smartphone or \ndownloaded to a consumer\u2019s printer. Digital coupons eliminate printing costs, reduce paper waste, \nare easily updatable, and have higher redemption rates. Many retailers are now offering customized \ncoupons based on consumer purchase histories.47\nSales promotions can produce a high sales response in the short run but little permanent gain \nover the longer term. Price promotions usually do not build permanent total-category volume.  Having \nturned to zero percent financing, hefty cash rebates, and special lease programs during sluggish eco -\nnomic times, auto manufacturers have found it difficult to wean consumers from discounts ever \nsince.48 Sales promotions often prompt consumers to engage in stockpiling\u2014purchasing earlier than \nusual (purchase acceleration) or buying extra quantities. As a result, after the initial peak, sales often hit \na post-promotion dip.49 And while their impact on sales is often temporary, incessant price reductions, \ncoupons, deals, and premiums can have a longer-term negative impact by devaluing the company\u2019s \noffering in buyers\u2019 minds.\nNot all sales promotions are detrimental to the company\u2019s brand image. Some sales promotion \ntools are consumer franchise building .

Salespeople in particular are quick to give discounts to close a sale. But \nword can get around fast that the company\u2019s list price is \u201csoft,\u201d and discounting becomes the norm, \nundermining the perceived value of the offerings. Some product categories self-destruct by always \nbeing on sale.\nSome companies with overcapacity are tempted to give discounts or even begin to supply a retailer \nwith a store-brand version of their product at a deep discount. Because the store brand is priced lower, \nhowever, it may start making inroads into sales of the manufacturer\u2019s brand. Manufacturers should \nconsider the implications of supplying retailers at a discount, because they may end up losing long-run \nprofits in an effort to meet short-run volume goals.\nManagers need to monitor the proportion of customers receiving discounts, the average discount, \nand any tendency for salespeople to rely too heavily on discounting. To this end, managers should \nconduct a net price analysis  to arrive at the \u201creal price\u201d of the offering. The real price is affected not \nonly by discounts but also by other expenses that reduce the realized price. Suppose the company\u2019s \nlist price is $3,000. The average discount is $300. The company\u2019s promotional spending averages $450 \n(15 percent of the list price). Retailers are given co-op advertising money of $150 to back the product. \nIn this case the company\u2019s net price is $2,100, not $3,000.\nMAJOR INCENTIVE DECISIONS\nIn using incentives, a company must establish its objectives, select the tools, develop the program, \nimplement and control it, and evaluate the results.\nEstablishing the Objectives of Incentives.  The objectives of incentives derive from basic \nmarketing objectives for the offering. Depending on whether a manufacturer\u2019s promotional activity is \nfocused on consumers or retailers, incentives have different objectives:\nFor consumer  incentives, objectives include encouraging more frequent purchases or the purchase \nof larger-sized units among users, fostering trial of one\u2019s product among nonusers, and attracting \nswitchers away from competitors\u2019 brands. If some of the brand switchers would not have otherwise \ntried the brand, incentives can yield long-term increases in market share.50 Ideally, consumer incentives \nhave short-run sales impact and long-run effects on brand equity.51\nFor retailer  incentives, objectives include persuading the retailer or wholesaler to carry the brand; \npersuading the retailer or wholesaler to carry more units than the normal amount; inducing retailers \nto promote the brand by featuring, display, and price reductions; and motivating retailers and their \nsales clerks to push the product.\nDefining the Size and Approach for Incentives.  In deciding to use a particular incen -\ntive, marketers must first determine its size. The incentive must be meaningful to target customers if \nthe promotion is to succeed. Second, the marketing manager must establish conditions  for participation. \nIncentives might be offered to everyone or to select groups. Third, the marketer must decide on the \nduration  of the promotion. Fourth, the marketer must choose a distribution vehicle . A 50-cents-off coupon \ncan be distributed in the product package, in stores, by mail, online, or in advertising. Fifth, the mar -\nketing manager must establish the timing  of the promotion. And finally, the total sales promotion budget  \nmust be set. The cost of a particular promotion consists of the administrative cost (printing, mailing, \nand promoting the deal) and the incentive cost (cost of premium or cents-off, including redemption \ncosts), multiplied by the expected number of units sold. The cost of a coupon deal recognizes that only \na fraction of consumers will redeem the coupons.\nIn addition to determining the size of incentives, a firm must decide how to allocate resources and, \nspecifically, how much effort to devote to push activities and how much to pull activities.\nA push strategy  uses the manufacturer\u2019s sales force, trade promotion money, or other means to \ninduce intermediaries to carry, promote, and sell the product to end users. This strategy is particularly \nappropriate when there is low brand loyalty in a category, brand choice is made in the store, the product \nis an impulse item, and product benefits are well understood.\nIn a pull strategy  the manufacturer uses advertising, promotion, and other forms of communica -\ntion to persuade consumers to demand the product from intermediaries, thus inducing the interme -\ndiaries to order it.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7f6a5e4-b68f-4e92-bd98-5416bced7a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7f6a5e4-b68f-4e92-bd98-5416bced7a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e41e8c8b-c702-4c44-9d73-b157c33d6fcb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "21a68585d266cffb8b2b71a0556d06a37fe757e90a2cc9842d7962b3b652adc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13d01bad-4976-4564-85fb-492fe2d30328", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "52b8f1fc7f224d65e491003be51c0dba0e4c3024be486a1b74d6767e12f746c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db9b5edd-ee97-4e80-b6ff-5ef242b93eff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c230a08bcbb298b027c6f64a8c923bfffed93c5bc96581cce3cf05b5adc1de6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The cost of a coupon deal recognizes that only \na fraction of consumers will redeem the coupons.\nIn addition to determining the size of incentives, a firm must decide how to allocate resources and, \nspecifically, how much effort to devote to push activities and how much to pull activities.\nA push strategy  uses the manufacturer\u2019s sales force, trade promotion money, or other means to \ninduce intermediaries to carry, promote, and sell the product to end users.

A push strategy is more effective when accompanied by a well-designed and well-executed \npull strategy that activates consumer demand. On the other hand, without at least some consumer \ninterest, it can be very difficult to gain much channel acceptance and support\u2014and vice versa for that \nmatter.\nSelecting Consumer Incentives.  The sales promotion planner should take into account \nthe type of market, the sales promotion objectives, competitive conditions, and each tool\u2019s cost-  \neffectiveness.52 The main consumer incentives  include the following:\n\u2022 Price reductions  are temporary price discounts that aim to foster sales. Price reductions can be ini -\ntiated by the manufacturer seeking to increase sales or by the retailer trying to move the mer -\nchandise and clear the inventory. Price reductions can be framed in terms of specific monetary \namounts or as a percentage.53\n\u2022 Coupons  are certificates entitling the bearer to a stated saving on the purchase of a specific product. \nThey can be mailed, enclosed in or attached to other products, inserted in magazine and newspa -\nper ads, e-mailed, or made available online.54\n\u2022 Cash refunds  provide a price reduction after purchase rather than at the retailer: The consumer \nsends a specified \u201cproof of purchase\u201d to the manufacturer, who \u201crefunds\u201d part of the purchase \nprice by mail. Auto companies and other consumer-goods companies offer cash rebates to \nencourage purchase of the manufacturers\u2019 products within a specified time period. Rebates can \nhelp clear inventories without cutting the stated list price.55\n\u2022 Price packs  offer savings off the regular price of a product, flagged on the label or package. A reduced-\nprice pack  is a single package sold at a reduced price (such as two for the price of one). A banded pack  \nis two related products banded together (such as a toothbrush and toothpaste).56\n\u2022 Premiums  (bonus offerings) are merchandise offered at a relatively low cost or free as an incentive to \npurchase a particular product. A premium can accompany the product (packed inside or affixed \nto the package), or it can be distributed via a different channel (such as by mail).\n\u2022 Frequency programs  provide rewards related to the consumer\u2019s frequency and intensity in purchasing \nthe company\u2019s products or services.\n\u2022 Prizes  are offers of the chance to win cash, trips, or merchandise as a result of purchasing some -\nthing. A contest  calls for consumers to submit an entry to be examined by a panel of judges who will \nselect the best entries. A sweepstakes  asks consumers to submit their names in a drawing. A\u00a0 game  \npresents consumers with something every time they buy\u2014bingo numbers, missing  letters\u2014\nwhich might help them win a prize.57\n\u2022 Tie-in promotions  involve a scenario in which two or more brands or companies team up on cou -\npons, refunds, and contests to increase pulling power.\n\u2022 Seasonal discounts  are price reductions for those who buy merchandise or services out of season. \nHotels, motels, and airlines offer seasonal discounts in slow selling periods.\n\u2022 Financing  involves providing favorable financing terms in order to increase the attractiveness of \nan offering for consumers. Alternatively, sellers (especially mortgage banks and auto companies) \noffer extended payment terms by stretching loans over longer periods and thus lowering the \nmonthly payments.\nSelecting Trade Incentives.  Manufacturers award money to distribution channel members \nin the form of trade incentives. Unlike consumer incentives that aim to create greater value for buyers, \ntrade incentives  aim to increase the attractiveness of the offering for the members of the distribu -\ntion channel\u2014wholesalers, retailers, and dealers. Specifically, manufacturers use a number of trade \npromotion tools:58\n\u2022 Allowances  are extra payments offered in return for the retailer\u2019s performing certain functions, \nsuch as promoting the offering at the point of sale, keeping a larger inventory to ensure product \navailability, and providing additional value-added services.\n\u2022 Free goods  are free merchandise to intermediaries who buy a certain quantity or who feature a \ncertain flavor or size.\n\u2022 Price-off  is a straight discount off the list price on each case purchased during a stated time period.\n\u2022 A payment discount  is a price reduction to buyers who pay bills promptly. A typical example is \n\u201c2/10, net 30,\u201d which means payment is due within 30 days but the buyer can deduct 2 percent by \npaying within 10 days.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4641, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4e330d1-f594-4752-9c7c-b5f0cc243bc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4e330d1-f594-4752-9c7c-b5f0cc243bc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3fe45be9-12dd-40d9-844b-297f39dc8363", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "70f9070ef43446e36b001c104deb67730c9127e23a40d9e56fcbe818a7d58b01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db9b5edd-ee97-4e80-b6ff-5ef242b93eff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "4b7c22aef9fa298ee49cfc2c5b51a985ecdaf288662cef2bd1d59bb9c3c121bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8daeba36-029e-4c9c-8158-1b86bc43ccf9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afc1a255cf151d0462dd514c0951717a2d6ef248186e4716f80ff8481eaa77a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 11    |  MANAGING  PrIcING AND  SALES  PrOMOTIONS  257\nThe growing power of large retailers has increased their ability to demand trade promotions.59 \nThe manufacturer\u2019s sales force and its brand managers are often at odds here. The sales force says local \nretailers will not keep the company\u2019s products on the shelf unless they receive more trade promo -\ntion money, whereas brand managers want to spend their limited funds on consumer promotion and \nadvertising.\nManufacturers, who often find it difficult to police retailers to make sure they are doing what they \nagreed to do, increasingly insist on proof of performance before paying any allowances.  Manufacturers \nface several challenges in managing trade promotions. Some retailers are doing forward buying  \u2014\nthat is, buying a greater quantity during the deal period than they can immediately sell. The manu -\nfacturer must then schedule more production than planned and bear the costs of extra work shifts \nand overtime. Other retailers are diverting\u2014 that is, buying more than needed in a region where the \nmanufacturer offers a deal and shipping the surplus to their stores in non-deal regions. Manufacturers \nhandle forward buying and diverting by limiting the amount they will sell at a discount or producing \nand delivering less than the full order in an effort to smooth production.\nSelecting Sales Force Incentives.  Companies spend billions of dollars on sales force pro -\nmotion tools to gather leads, impress and reward customers, and motivate the sales force. Sales force \nincentives  aim to encourage the sales force to support a new product or model, boosting prospecting \nand stimulating off-season sales. Sales contests are one popular type of sales force incentive. A sales \ncontest aims at inducing the sales force or dealers to increase sales results over a stated period, with \nprizes (money, trips, gifts, or points) going to those who succeed.\nThe budgets that companies develop for incentive tools typically remain fairly constant from year \nto year. For many new businesses that want to make a splash with a targeted audience, especially in \nthe B2B world, trade shows are an important tool, but the cost per contact is the highest of all com -\nmunication options.\u00a0The topic of managing sales force and personal selling is discussed in more detail \nin Chapter 15.\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\ninjecting a measured dose of epinephrine as an emer -\ngency treatment of serious allergic reactions to insect \nstings/bites, foods, drugs, or other substances\u2014went \nfrom $100\u00a0for a two-pack in 2009 to $608 in 2016.

Marketers must modify their price-setting logic when \nthe product is part of a product mix and the com -\npany\u2019s goal is to maximize the profits on the total mix. \n Common scenarios for product-mix pricing include \nloss-leader pricing, optional-feature pricing, captive-\nproduct pricing, two-part pricing, by-product pricing, \nand product bundling.\n8. To gain market position and grow profits, companies \noften take aggressive pricing actions, either lowering \ntheir prices, typically to lure competitors\u2019 customers, or \nraising prices to capture greater value from its current \ncustomers. Companies must anticipate competitor price \nchanges and prepare contingent responses, which may \ninclude maintaining or changing price or quality.\n9. The firm facing a competitor\u2019s price change must try \nto understand the competitor\u2019s intent and the probable \nduration of the change. A market leader attacked by \nlower-priced competitors can seek to better differentiate \nitself, to introduce its own low-cost competitor, or to \ntransform itself completely.\n10. Incentives consist of a collection of incentive tools, mostly \nshort-term, designed to stimulate quicker or greater pur -\nchase of particular products or services by consumers or \nthe trade. In using incentives, a company must establish \nits objectives, select the tools, develop the program, \nimplement and control it, and evaluate the results.\n11. In designing incentives, a firm must decide how much \neffort to devote to push strategies and to pull strategies. \nA push strategy uses the manufacturer\u2019s sales force, \ntrade promotion money, or other means to induce \nintermediaries to carry, promote, and sell the product \nto end users. In a pull strategy, the manufacturer uses \nadvertising and incentives to persuade consumers to \ndemand the product from intermediaries, thus inducing \nthe intermediaries to order it. Selecting the right mix of \npush and pull strategies is an important ingredient in \nsecuring trade support.summary\n1. Price is the only marketing element that produces rev-\nenue; the others produce costs. Pricing decisions have \nbecome more challenging in a changing economic and \ntechnological environment.\n2. Purchase decisions are based on how consumers per -\nceive prices, rather than just on the offering\u2019s stated \nprice. Understanding how consumers arrive at their \nperceptions of prices\u2014and, specifically, the role of \nreference prices, price\u2013quality inferences, and price \nendings\u2014can help the company set the optimal \nmarket\u00a0price.\n3. In setting pricing policy, a company follows a six-step \nprocedure. It selects its pricing objective. It estimates \nthe demand curve, the probable quantities it will sell \nat each possible price. It estimates how its costs vary \nat different levels of output, at different levels of accu -\nmulated production experience, and for differentiated \nmarketing offers. It examines competitors\u2019 costs, prices, \nand offers. It selects a pricing method, and it sets the \nfinal price.\n4. When setting a price, a company can pursue different \nobjectives: current profit, market penetration, market \nskimming, and leadership in product quality. The clearer \na firm\u2019s objectives, the easier it is to set price.\n5. The demand curve shows the market\u2019s probable \n purchase quantity at alternative prices, summing the \nreactions of many individuals with different price sen -\nsitivities.

Priceline \nacquired the\u00a0European hotel-booking sites Active Hotels \nand Booking.com in 2004 and 2005, respectively, a move \nthat would eventually be hailed as one of the most suc -\ncessful  acquisitions in internet history. Priceline acquired \nAgoda.com, an online travel agency in Southeast Asia, \nin 2007; rentalcars.com, a car rental service, in 2010; \nKayak, a meta-search company, in 2013; and OpenTable, \na restaurant reservation service, in 2014. Priceline\u2019s busi -\nness expansion caused its stock to surpass the peak it \nhad reached in 1999.\nMuch of Priceline\u2019s success can be attributed to the \ncompany\u2019s focus on businesses in the most profitable seg-\nments of online travel. Hotels account for over 85 percent \nof Priceline\u2019s gross bookings, compared to 48 percent for \nExpedia, Priceline\u2019s closest competitor. The hotel market is \nless concentrated than air travel, so Priceline can generate \nmore profit by concentrating on hotel bookings, for which it \ncan charge a 15 percent to 20 percent commission, com-\npared to about 3 percent for air bookings. In addition, much \nof Priceline\u2019s gross bookings are in Europe. In contrast to \nthe United States, European hotel markets consist mostly \nof independent properties, which means that they have a \nmore difficult time attracting customers. By properly indexing \n European hotels, Priceline achieves greater bargaining power \nin its commission.\nPriceline\u2019s data analytics processes also create a com-\npetitive advantage. Priceline carefully researches how and \nwhere it purchases online ads. This approach across all \nof its businesses has created industry-leading advertising \neffectiveness. The company spends an average of $7.50 per \nbooked hotel room, compared to $16.00 for Expedia. In addi-\ntion, Priceline uses data analytics to maximize its website \n\u201cconversions\u201d\u2014when a consumer moves from browsing the \nwebsite to booking a service. Priceline\u2019s research of cus-\ntomer demographics and behaviors allows it to leverage per -\nsonalized ads on websites and in e-mails. Priceline achieved Priceline\nPriceline launched in 1998 when Jay S. Walker first intro -\nduced its \u201cName Your Own Price\u201d service for purchasing \nairline tickets online. Priceline flipped the conventional sys -\ntem of purchasing goods by having the buyer \u201cset\u201d prices. \nTypically, sellers advertise a good in the marketplace at \na specific price, and buyers decide whether they want \nit. Priceline designed a mechanism whereby customers \nlogged on to the company website, posted an \u201cadvertise -\nment\u201d that indicated where they wanted to go, the dates of \ntravel, and the price they were willing to pay. Priceline then \nsearched the databases of partnered airlines for compat -\nible tickets. customers had to be flexible about the car -\nrier and the time of day for their flight; they received their \nticket and carrier information only after the transaction \nwas\u00a0completed.\nAt the start of its airline ticket service, Priceline partnered \nonly with America West and TWA. A year after inception, \nPriceline had sold tickets to over 1 million individuals. Shortly \nafter, big-name air carriers such as United, American, and \nDelta joined as partners. Priceline\u2019s model of online bookings \nproved valuable to airlines, because the carrier is anony-\nmous throughout the buying process and doesn\u2019t have to \ndilute its brand by selling tickets at large discounts while also \nmaintaining its own established prices. The model was also \nattractive to budget-conscious travelers because, on aver -\nage, customers found lower prices than they otherwise would \nhave through their own online searches.\nThe company grew at a dramatic pace, and Priceline \nhired William Shatner to spearhead its advertising cam-\npaigns. Priceline spent millions to feature Shatner in newspa-\nper and radio advertisements. Its advertising efforts proved \nsuccessful in increasing brand awareness. Priceline became \none of the top 10 best-known internet websites by 1999. \nrevenues in 1999 reached approximately $500 million, and \nPriceline\u2019s IPO was $12.9 billion, the highest first-day value at \nthe time.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4295, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37c3ea62-d152-4071-9db9-9c066e16cc0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "37c3ea62-d152-4071-9db9-9c066e16cc0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4852d07-a35c-486e-bbfa-1e635e5b414a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "ebb4bb79357a6aa1b61a1e36a41bccded5cfaa50697916688248eac411b07a91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c5fe689-515d-4312-9068-964ebe1f9571", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "data/Chap11.pdf"}, "hash": "25fe5b6458e024b7b8d0941e2ee4a0f07d1f5ced0d5136770f842bcd05ed9e91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2bce445-6750-416b-aa7d-a37d7108bcfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "885b10defc554c4029a6ee8c431737510d8337a4119933ce9f17f2d996391e1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The model was also \nattractive to budget-conscious travelers because, on aver -\nage, customers found lower prices than they otherwise would \nhave through their own online searches.\nThe company grew at a dramatic pace, and Priceline \nhired William Shatner to spearhead its advertising cam-\npaigns.

Uber\u2019s version of carpooling \nsaved customers around 50 percent of the cost of a taxi \ncab\u00a0ride.\nThe key to Uber\u2019s success is its ease of use. riders sim-\nply need to download the app, create an account, and enter \ntheir payment information. The app displays available drivers \nnearby. To summon one, riders simply input their destination \nand press a button to be matched with a driver. The customer \ncan track the location of the matched driver, view the driver\u2019s \nname and car information, and look at the driver\u2019s quality \nrating. customers are able to refuse drivers with low ratings. \nLike riders, drivers have the right to refuse customers with \nsufficiently low ratings.

The two were \ninspired to create a smart-phone app that would call a taxi \ncab. returning to San Francisco, camp bought the domain \nname Uber cab.com, and the company officially launched \ntwo years later. Uber cab was initially a private luxury car \nservice for San Francisco and Silicon Valley executives. \nInterested customers first had to e-mail Kalanick for access \nto the application. After entering their payment information, \ncustomers were able to summon a private black car. Unlike \ntraditional black car services, the Uber cab app allowed pas-\nsengers to track the arriving car\u2019s location and also guided \nthe driver to the rider\u2019s destination.\nUber began building traction almost immediately after \nthe app launched. Executives were particularly drawn by the \nsheer convenience of Uber. Most executives had to book an \nexpensive private car well in advance. Uber allowed them \nto quickly book a ride wherever they were. UberBlack was \npriced lower than private limousines but was more expen-\nsive than a typical cab ride. By the end of the year, Uber \nhad dropped the cab from its name and had thousands of \nusers riding around San Francisco. As Uber attracted more \nand more customers and drivers, investors also became \ninterested in the company. In February 2011, Uber raised \n$11\u00a0 million from venture-capital firm Benchmark. convinced \nthat the concept it had created could scale, Uber began to \nexpand across the nation and worldwide. In May of 2011, \nUber launched in New York city. Later that year, Uber \nlaunched its service in Paris.\nIn 2012, Uber introduced a new service called uberX, \na cheaper version that allowed drivers to use their personal \nvehicles instead of black cars to pick up passengers. The \nqualifications to be an uberX driver were much less strict than \nthose for UberBlack, which required that drivers be licensed \nlimousine operators and that their vehicles meet Uber\u2019s \nthe industry\u2019s highest conversion rate in 2019; the high con-\nversion increases profit margins on each booking.\nPriceline has led the online travel industry by a wide \nmargin. Its market capitalization is over three times that of its \nnext closest competitor. The foundation of Priceline\u2019s suc-\ncess is its focus on profitable market segments and rigorous \ndedication to data analytics, enables the company to achieve \nhigh profit margins.62Questions\n1.
