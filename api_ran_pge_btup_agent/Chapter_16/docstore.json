At a \ntime when most luxury brands were intimidated by online retailers, Net-a-Porter set out to create \na superior yet convenient shopping experience to bring luxury items to high-net-worth buyers. \nSince its launch, Net-a-Porter has established itself as the world\u2019s premier luxury fashion retailer, \noffering a portfolio of over 800 designer brands, including Gucci, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Chloe, \nAlexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Valentino, and Stella McCartney. A key to the company\u2019s success \nwas its business model, which called for merging editorial content and retail capability to create a \nfashion magazine selling luxury brands. \u201cPeople always say to me, \u2018You\u2019ve really strived to redefine Managing Retailing16\nNet-a-Porter \ncreated a luxury \nonline shopping \nexperience \nby merging \n editorial content \nand magazine-\nquality images \nto  showcase \nproducts in \nits portfolio of \n800-plus designer \nbrands.\nSource: Casimiro/Alamy \nStock Photo\nIn the preceding chapter, we examined marketing intermediaries primarily in their capacity  as \nmanufacturers that want to build and manage marketing channels.

Several years later, in 2010, Switzerland-based luxury goods holding company \nRichemont acquired a majority stake in Net-a-Porter in a deal that valued the online retailer at over \n$500 million. In 2015, Net-a-Porter merged with Yoox, an online retailer of off-season luxury goods, \nto create the world\u2019s leading online luxury fashion retailer, Yoox Net-a-Porter Group.1\nThe retail market can be unforgiving. Although innovative retailers such as Zappos, Sweden\u2019s H&M, \nSpain\u2019s Zara and Mango, and Britain\u2019s Topshop have thrived in recent years, others, such as former U.S. \nstalwarts JCPenney, Kohl\u2019s, and Kmart, have struggled. The more successful companies use strategic \nplanning, state-of-the-art technology, advanced information systems, and sophisticated marketing \ntools. They segment their markets, improve their market targeting and positioning, and connect with \ntheir customers through memorable experiences, relevant and timely information, and, of course, the \nright products and services. In this chapter, we discuss marketing excellence in retailing.\nThe Modern Retail Environment\nRetailing  includes all the activities involved in selling goods or services directly to final consumers \nfor personal, nonbusiness use. A retailer or retail store is any business enterprise whose sales volume \ncomes primarily from retailing. Any organization selling to final consumers\u2014no matter whether \nit is a manufacturer, a wholesaler, or a retailer\u2014is doing retailing. It also doesn\u2019t matter how  the \ngoods or services are sold (in person, by mail, by telephone, by vending machine, or online) or where   \n(in a store, on the street, or in a consumer\u2019s home).\nThe retail marketing environment is dramatically different today from what it was just a decade \nago. The retail market is very dynamic, and a number of new types of competitors and competition \nhave emerged in recent years.\n\u2022 New retail forms and combinations.  To better satisfy customers\u2019 need for convenience, a \nvariety of new retail forms have emerged. Bookstores feature coffee shops. Gas stations include \nfood stores. Loblaws supermarkets have fitness clubs.

Shopping malls and bus and train stations have peddlers\u2019 \ncarts in their aisles. Retailers are also experimenting with \u201cpop-up\u201d stores that let them promote \nbrands to seasonal shoppers for a few weeks in busy areas. Pop-up stores are designed to create \nbuzz, often through interactive experiences. Google uses pop-up stores as an easy way to establish \na physical presence during holiday shopping seasons. In addition to gaining a retail footprint by \nacquiring Whole Foods, Amazon has launched its own brick-and-mortar stores.\n\u2022 Retailer consolidation.  Through their superior information systems, logistical systems, and \nbuying power, giant retailers such as Walmart are able to deliver good service and immense vol -\numes of product to masses of consumers at appealing prices. They are crowding out smaller \nmanufacturers that cannot deliver enough quantity, and they often dictate to the most powerful \nones what to make, how to price and promote it, when and how to ship, and even how to improve \nproduction and management. Without these accounts, manufacturers could lose a significant \nportion of their sales. Because consolidated retailers have power over manufacturers, they tend \nto charge a variety of allowance fees for listing, stocking, and promoting new brands.\n\u2022 Growth of mobile retailing.  Consumers are fundamentally changing the way they shop, \nincreasingly using a cell phone to text a friend or relative about a product while shopping in \nstores. Over 50 percent of all Google searches are done on mobile phones. In some parts of the \nworld, m-commerce is well established. Asian consumers use their mobile phones as their main \ncomputers and benefit from a well-developed mobile infrastructure. Mobile ads are accepted by \nconsumers and relatively inexpensive for firms. In South Korea, Tesco created virtual subway \nstores for commuters traveling on Seoul\u2019s underground transportation system. Interactive, life -\nlike store aisles with a wide range of product and brand images were superimposed on walls. \nConsumers could order products for home delivery by simply snapping photos with their phones.\n\u2022 Growth of omnichannel retailing.  Retailing has evolved from a purely brick-and-mortar \nformat to a scenario in which retailers have augmented their physical locations with online stores \ndesigned to cater to consumers who prefer shopping online. In this physical + online format, \nbrick-and-mortar stores and online stores perform the same functions, with online sales partially \ncannibalizing the sales in physical stores. Realizing the potential inefficiencies in managing two \nindependent distribution channels, many retailers have moved to an omnichannel model in which \nphysical locations complement one another rather than competing. For example, many retailers\u2014\nincluding Best Buy, Target, and Nordstrom\u2014are integrating their online and offline operations to \noffer a seamless customer experience in a way that is effective and cost-efficient for the company. \nFor example, Home Depot enables customers to search online the available inventory at each of its \nstores and have the items that are not locally available shipped to the local store or to customers\u2019 \nhomes. Customers may also return unwanted items by either shipping them back or bringing \nthem to a nearby store.\n\u2022 Growth of fast retailing . An important trend in fashion retailing in particular, but with  \nbroader implications as well, is the emergence of fast retailing. Here retailers develop completely \ndifferent supply chain and distribution systems in order to offer consumers constantly changing \nproduct choices. Fast retailing requires thoughtful decisions in a number of areas, including new-\nproduct development, sourcing, manufacturing, inventory management, and selling practices. \nConsumers have been attracted to fast-fashion retailers such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, TopShop, \nand Forever 21 because of the novelty, value, and fashion sense of their offerings and have made \nthese retailers successful.\n\u2022 Increasing role of technology.  Technology is profoundly affecting the way retailers conduct \nnearly every facet of their business. Nearly all now use technology to produce forecasts, control \ninventory costs, and order from suppliers, reducing the need to discount and run sales to clear \nout languishing products. Technology is also directly affecting the consumer shopping experience \ninside the store. Electronic shelf labeling allows retailers to change price levels instantaneously. \nIn-store programming can run continual demonstrations or promotional messages. Retailers are \nexperimenting with virtual shopping screens, audio/video presentations, and QR code integration. \nThey are also developing fully integrated digital communication strategies with well-designed \nwebsites, e-mails, search strategies, and social media campaigns. Social media are especially \nimportant for retailers during the holiday season, when shoppers are seeking information \nand sharing successes. Amazon has opened cashier-less stores that use cameras and artificial \nintelligence to detect what items customers put in their carts, and charge them accordingly, \nwithout their having to go through a check-out process.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5300, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3928eb3b-b182-4b25-936b-eb0c54687d86": {"__data__": {"id_": "3928eb3b-b182-4b25-936b-eb0c54687d86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4dffa050-05a9-4df0-b3b0-aefe9dda5b32", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "0d9167f31c3d702d5191ba600a54a18b57aef4a3438951e816009cd0a1d44773", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89d6d311-1c5e-4493-92c0-792291777588", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "a01dd320e883673a91ad6ada00cb23f250a6b083fd16c3cb461a0ada26523acb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2456e25-8405-43eb-88a6-4a8c5904a0ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd6420d319c32d9287821b807d80e4c2dc20c11ba5302402aae16d2524286f8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 16    |  MANAGING  REtAILING  349\n\u2022 Decline of middle-market retailers.  The retail market today is hourglass shaped: Growth \nseems to be centered at the top (with luxury offerings from retailers like Tiffany and Neiman \nMarcus) and at the bottom (with discount pricing from retailers like Walmart and Dollar General). \nAs discount retailers have improved their quality and image, consumers have been willing to trade \ndown. Target offers Phillip Lim, Jason Wu, and Missoni designs, and Kmart sells an extensive line \nof Joe Boxer underwear and sleepwear. At the other end of the spectrum, Coach converted 40 of its \nnearly 300 stores to a more upscale format that offers higher-priced bags and concierge services. \nOpportunities are scarcer in the middle, where once-successful retailers such as JCPenney, \nKohl\u2019s, Sears, CompUSA, RadioShack, and Montgomery Ward have struggled or even gone out \nof business. Supermarket chains like SuperValu and Safeway have found themselves caught in the \nmiddle between the affluent appeal of chains like Whole Foods and Wegmans and the discount \nappeal of Aldi and Walmart. Compounding problems is the plight of middle-class shoppers,  \nwho have seen their buying power shrink as a consequence of slumping housing prices and \nstagnating incomes.\nKey Retailing Decisions\nWith this new retail environment as a backdrop, we now examine retailers\u2019 marketing decisions in \nsome key areas: target market, product assortment, procurement, services, store atmosphere and \nexperiences, pricing, incentives, and communication. We discuss private labels later in this chapter.\nTARGET MARKET\nUntil it defines and profiles the target market, the retailer cannot make consistent decisions about \nproduct assortment, store d\u00e9cor, advertising messages and media, price, and service levels. Whole \nFoods has succeeded by offering a unique shopping experience to a customer base interested in \norganic and natural foods.\nWhole Foods Market  In over 480 stores in North America and the United Kingdom, \nWhole Foods (acquired by Amazon in 2017) creates celebrations of food. Its markets are bright \nand well staffed, and food displays are colorful, bountiful, and seductive. Whole Foods is the \nlargest U.S. organic and natural foods grocer. Whole Foods also provides lots of information \nabout its food. If you want to know, for instance, whether the chicken in the display case lived a \nhappy, free-roaming life, you can get a booklet and an invitation to visit the farm in Pennsylvania \nwhere it was raised. For other help, you have only to ask a knowledgeable and easy-to-find \nemployee. A typical Whole Foods store has more than 200 employees, almost twice as many as \nSafeway. the company works hard to create an inviting store atmosphere, with prices scrawled \nin chalk, cardboard boxes and ice everywhere, and other creative display touches to make the \nshopper feel at home. Its approach is working, especially for consumers who view organic and \nartisanal food as an affordable luxury.2\nMistakes in choosing target markets can be costly. When historically mass market jeweler Zales \ndecided to chase upscale customers, it replaced one-third of its merchandise, dropping inexpensive, \nlow-quality diamond jewelry for high-margin, fashionable 14-karat gold and silver pieces and shifting \nits ad campaign in the process. The move was a disaster. Zales lost many of its traditional customers \nwithout winning over the new customers it hoped to attract.3\nTo better hit their targets, retailers are slicing the market into ever-finer segments and introducing \nnew lines of stores to exploit niche markets with more relevant offerings. For example, in recent years, \nchildren\u2019s clothing retailing has become segmented into a large number of niche markets.  Gymboree \nlaunched Janie and Jack, selling apparel and gifts for babies and toddlers; Hot Topic introduced  \nTorrid, selling trendy fashions for women who wear sizes 10 to 30; and Limited Brand\u2019s Tween Brands \nbegan to sell lower-priced fashion to tween girls through its Justice stores and to tween boys through \nits Brother shops.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2456e25-8405-43eb-88a6-4a8c5904a0ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2456e25-8405-43eb-88a6-4a8c5904a0ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d58e1501-0873-4781-aaf2-b876031a676e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "e33cb5ad3c31c70c27877179f37689fc0c6f5d2c4e3e2d9c267dfc0d859efb0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3928eb3b-b182-4b25-936b-eb0c54687d86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "c45f5a12bc7a4ec496bf1cd173d7f5200dcebf9ea914b07bf408c256b41ec63d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a45bf5a-bd3e-4b6e-bab1-5fb840f1b4e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5e0425134939ce53da660f28f1b061ab05c6ad8623cb60bada7a36c026f97a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "350 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nPRODUCT ASSORTMENT AND PROCUREMENT\nThe retailer\u2019s product assortment must match the target market\u2019s shopping expectations in both \nbreadth  and depth.4 A restaurant can offer a narrow and shallow assortment (small lunch counters), a \nnarrow and deep assortment (delicatessens), a broad and shallow assortment (cafeterias), or a broad \nand deep assortment (large restaurants).\nIdentifying the right product assortment can be especially challenging in fast-moving industries such \nas technology and fashion. At one point, Urban Outfitters ran into trouble when it strayed from its \u201chip \nbut not too hip\u201d formula, embracing new styles too quickly. In the same vein, active and casual apparel \nretailer A\u00e9ropostale faced head winds trying to match its product assortment to its young teens\u2019 needs in \na way that was profitable for the company. Forced into bankruptcy in 2016, A\u00e9ropostale had to streamline \nits product offerings and close more than two-thirds of its 800 stores in order to avoid extinction.\nDeveloping a product-differentiation strategy is a key challenge in defining the store\u2019s product \nassortment. Destination categories  may play a particularly important role because they have the greatest \nimpact on where households choose to shop and how they view a particular retailer. A supermarket \ncould be known for the freshness of its produce or for the variety and deals it offers in soft drinks and \nsnacks.5\nAfter deciding on the product-assortment strategy, the retailer must establish merchandise \nsources, policies, and practices. In the corporate headquarters of a supermarket chain, specialist buyers \n(sometimes called merchandise managers ) are responsible for developing brand assortments and listening \nto presentations from their suppliers\u2019 salespeople.\nRetailers are rapidly improving their skills in demand forecasting, merchandise selection, stock \ncontrol, space allocation, and display. They use sophisticated software to track inventory, compute eco -\nnomic order quantities, order goods, and analyze dollars spent on vendors and products. Supermarket \nchains use scanner data to manage their merchandise mix on a store-by-store basis.\nSome stores are using radio frequency identification (RFID) systems made up of \u201csmart\u201d tags\u2014\nmicrochips attached to tiny radio antennas\u2014and electronic readers to facilitate inventory control and \nproduct replenishment. The smart tags can be embedded on products or stuck on labels so that when \nthe tag is near a reader, it transmits a unique identifying number to its computer database. Coca-Cola \nand Gillette have used RFID systems to monitor inventory and track goods in real time as they move \nfrom factories to supermarkets to shopping baskets.>> Informative, colorful \ndisplays and knowledge-\nable employees provide \na welcoming atmosphere \nfor patrons of Whole \nFoods, the largest \nU.S.\u00a0organic and natural \nfoods grocer.\nSource: Maurice Savage/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2971, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a45bf5a-bd3e-4b6e-bab1-5fb840f1b4e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a45bf5a-bd3e-4b6e-bab1-5fb840f1b4e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25d6917c-16e7-4237-8515-457229084f0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "4f1e4c43b192bd45883060cdfef6290b8e7ca81efb22c00a7c55be9ee52e6744", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2456e25-8405-43eb-88a6-4a8c5904a0ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "e33cb5ad3c31c70c27877179f37689fc0c6f5d2c4e3e2d9c267dfc0d859efb0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62efb151-cf94-4b0d-a143-72c47134dc5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0741db7baa7506e55de21af86fea35fb2524be493609ac3b812d8023bff004cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 16    |  MANAGING  REtAILING  351\nStores are using direct product profitability to measure a product\u2019s handling costs (receiving, \nmoving to storage, tracking paperwork, selecting, checking, loading, and space cost) from the time it \nreaches the warehouse until a customer buys it in the retail store.

In this context, when setting its prices, retailers must take into account \nthe impact of each individual price on their price image (see \u201cMarketing Insight: Managing the Price \nImage of a Retailer\u201d).\nINCENTIVES\nTo make their offerings more attractive to customers, retailers often use incentives such as price \ndiscounts, volume discounts (such as buy one\u2013get one free), bonus offerings, and coupons. These \nincentives, also referred to as sales promotions, aim to generate store traffic and \u201cnudge\u201d customers \ntoward making a purchase.\nRetailers vary in the degree to which they use incentives. Two extreme strategies stand out: \neveryday low pricing and high\u2013low pricing. A retailer using everyday low pricing (EDLP)  charges a \nconstant low price with little or no price promotion or special sales. Constant prices eliminate week-\nto-week price uncertainty and the high\u2013low pricing of promotion-oriented competitors. In high\u2013low \npricing , the retailer charges higher prices on an everyday basis but runs frequent promotions featuring \nprices temporarily lower than prices at the EDLP level.17\nIn recent years, high \u2013low pricing has given way to EDLP at such widely different venues as Toyota \nScion car dealers and upscale department stores such as Nordstrom. But the king of EDLP is surely \nWalmart, which practically defined the term. Except for a few sale items every month, Walmart prom -\nises everyday low prices on major brands.\nRetailers like Walmart have avoided \u201csale pricing\u201d in favor of EDLP. This approach has led to \ngreater pricing stability, a stronger image of fairness and reliability, and higher retail profits. Those \nsupermarket chains that practice everyday low pricing can be more profitable than those that practice \nhigh\u2013low sale pricing, but only in certain circumstances, such as when the market is characterized by \nmany \u201clarge basket\u201d shoppers who tend to buy many items on any one trip.18\nThe most important reason why retailers adopt EDLP is that constant sales and promotions are \ncostly and have eroded consumer confidence in everyday shelf prices. Some consumers also have less \ntime and patience for past traditions such as watching for supermarket specials and clipping coupons. \nYet promotions and sales do create excitement and draw shoppers, so EDLP does not guarantee success \nand is not for everyone.19 JCPenney learned that lesson the hard way.\nJCPenney  When JCPenney hired Apple\u2019s retailing guru Ron Johnson as CEO, there was \nmuch anticipation about how he would transform the venerable department store giant. When \nJohnson found that the company had held 590 sales events the previous year and that almost \nthree-quarters of its sales revenue was from merchandise marked down 50 percent or more, \nhe decided to embark on a simplified pricing strategy. Coupons and sales were eliminated and \nreplaced by across-the-board price decreases of 40 percent. the everyday low pricing plan \nturned out to be a disaster, however, and with sales and stock price plunging, Johnson was \nquickly shown the door. A number of reasons have been suggested for the program\u2019s failure. \nCompetitors like Macy\u2019s and Sears continued to offer sales and discounts, giving the perception \nof good deals. Penney\u2019s customers missed the coupons and weekly sales events. Everyday low \nprices are thought to be more effective with more functional products, but they may actually \nharm more image-oriented products like fashion, an important category for JCPenney. One \ncommentator might have said it best when he stated, \u201cAt the end of the day, people don\u2019t want a \nfair price. they want a great deal.\u201d20\nWhile shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, consumers often use their smart phones to find deals \nor capitalize on promotions: The redemption rate for mobile coupons (10 percent) far exceeds that for \npaper coupons (1 percent).21 For retailers, research has shown that mobile promotions can get consum -\ners to travel greater distances within a store and make more unplanned purchases.22\nCompanies are trying to give their customers more control over their shopping experiences by \nbringing digital technologies into the store, especially via mobile apps. Consider Nordstrom. Although \nNordstrom expected its app to be used remotely, many customers launch it while shopping in a store, \nrather than approaching a salesperson.

They place ads, \nrun special sales, issue money-saving coupons, send e-mail promotions, present frequent-shopper \nreward programs and in-store food sampling, and put coupons on shelves or at check-out points. \nRetailers work with manufacturers to design point-of-sale materials that reflect both their images. \nThey time the arrival of their e-mails and design them with attention-grabbing subject lines, anima -\ntion, and personalized messages and advice.\nRetailers also use interactive and social media to pass on information and create communities \naround their brands.

A strong \nproponent of shopper marketing, Procter & Gamble calls the store encounter the \u201cfirst moment of \ntruth\u201d (product use and consumption are the second).26 P&G observed the power of displays in a \nWalmart project designed to boost sales of premium diapers such as Pampers.

Many retailers are employ -\ning mobile phone apps or \u201csmart\u201d shopping carts that help customers locate items in the store, find out \nabout sales and special offers, and pay more easily. Some companies, such as Mondel\u0113z, use \u201csmart \nshelf\u201d technology by putting, on shelves near the check-out, sensors that can detect the age and sex \nof a consumer and, by virtue of advanced analytics, target them with ads and promotions for a likely \nsnack candidate on a video screen.\nManaging Omnichannel Retailing\nBased on a target market analysis, retailers must decide which channels to employ to reach their customers.  \nIncreasingly, the answer is multiple channels. Staples sells through its traditional retail brick-and-mortar \nchannel, its own website (staples.com), virtual malls, and thousands of links on affiliated sites.\nThis increased reliance on multiple channels means that channels should be designed to work \ntogether effectively. Although some experts predicted otherwise, catalogs have actually grown in an \ninternet world as more firms have revamped them to serve as branding devices and to complement \nonline activity.

After witnessing women buying expensive lingerie as fashion items from \nsmall boutiques in Europe, Limited Brands founder Leslie Wexner felt that a similar store model \ncould work on a mass scale in the United States, even though such a store format was unlike \nanything the average shopper would have encountered at department stores. Wexner, however, \nhad reason to believe U.S. women would relish the opportunity to have a European-style lingerie \nshopping experience with soft pink wallpaper, inviting fitting rooms, and attentive staff. \u201cWomen \nneed underwear, but women want lingerie,\u201d he observed. Wexner\u2019s assumption proved correct: \nA little more than a decade after he bought the business, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s average customer \nbought eight to 10 bras per year, compared with the national average of two. the growth of digital \nmedia and e-commerce forced Victoria\u2019s Secret to boost its online presence. During the past two \ndecades, the company has reduced the number of physical catalogs it mails out from 450 million \nto 300 million copies, allocating more and more resources to digital means of communication.27\nWe can distinguish among brick-and-mortar  retailers, online  (pure-click) retailers that have ventured \ninto e-commerce without a physical retail location, and omnichannel  (brick-and-click) companies that \nhave both a physical and an online presence. We discuss these three types of retailers next.\nBRICK-AND-MORTAR RETAILERS\nPerhaps the best-known type of brick-and-mortar retailer is the department store.

The most common \ntypes of brick-and-mortar retailers are summarized as follows:\nDepartment stores  such as JCPenney, Macy\u2019s, and Bloomingdale\u2019s carry several product lines.\nSpecialty stores  such as The Limited, The Body Shop, and Sephora carry a single product line (or a \nfew related product lines).", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4689, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0560911f-5263-4da9-a13c-bbf8c2e4747d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0560911f-5263-4da9-a13c-bbf8c2e4747d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49c3115b-e774-4073-bcee-efbaa083fc5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "1a1bf71dd679a49f9332029e682ea37ac166457ac9e226d552847df8ce584414", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd5e2505-33b5-41bd-8897-f44534da6e2e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "288e5ed5a3f4fdc94a70c0c49fd21aa2d5c7e396c61c449c8ecfbedda7e74ccb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38106a14-f8a4-4465-8218-7074b2aac0ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b232123014ab200c4b6e33f70b68ef50ceae6f76a90d3f51253304f32513860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "358 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nSupermarkets  such as Kroger, Albertsons, and Safeway are large, low-cost, low-margin, high-\nvolume, self-service stores designed to meet a family\u2019s total needs for food and household \nproducts.\nConvenience stores  such as 7-Eleven, Circle K, and Oxxo are small stores in residential areas, often \nopen 24/7, carrying a limited line of high-turnover convenience products.\nDrugstores  such as CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens carry prescription drugs, health and beauty aids, \nand other personal-care, small durable, and miscellaneous items.\nMass merchandisers  such as Walmart and Carrefour are low-price, low-margin, high-volume stores \nthat sell routinely purchased food and household items, plus services (laundry, shoe repair, dry \ncleaning, check cashing).\nCategory killers  such as The Home Depot, Staples, and PetSmart carry a narrow but deep  assortment \nin one category.\nExtreme value or hard-discount stores  such as Aldi, Lidl, Dollar General, and Family Dollar carry a very \nlimited merchandise mix offered at heavily discounted prices.\nOff-price retailers  such as TJ Maxx and factory outlets offer leftover goods, overruns, and irregular \nmerchandise sold at less than retail.\nWarehouse clubs  such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, and BJ\u2019s offer larger quantities (e.g., mega-packs) at \nlow prices.\nAutomatic vending  offers a variety of merchandise, including impulse goods such as soft drinks, \ncoffee, candy, newspapers, and magazines.

Online \nretailers can predictably provide convenient, informative, and \npersonalized experiences for vastly different types of consum -\ners and businesses.

Members were alerted of deals and their deadlines via e-mails that \nconveyed a sense of immediacy and urgency. Adding luxury brands such as theory and Louis \nVuitton, the firm grew to more than 8 million members. As the economy improved, however, Gilt \nfound itself challenged by dwindling inventory, growing competition from other sites, and its own \naggressive expansion strategy, which included men\u2019s clothes, kids\u2019 products, home products, \ntravel packages, and food. the company responded by focusing more on its core strength in \nwomen\u2019s fashion and developing tighter relationships with customers via personalized e-mails to \nannounce its sales.

Germany and Spain are also European markets with a high percentage of private-\nlabel sales.\nFor many manufacturers, retailers are both collaborators and competitors. According to the Pri -\nvate Label Manufacturers\u2019 Association, store brands now account for one of every five items sold in U.S. \nsupermarkets, drug chains, and mass merchandisers. In one study, seven of 10 shoppers believed the \nprivate-label products they bought were as good as, if not better than, their national-brand counter -\nparts, and virtually every household purchases private-label brands from time to time.31 The stakes in \nprivate-label marketing are high. A one-percentage-point shift from national brands to private labels \nin food and beverages is estimated to add $5.5 billion in revenue for supermarket chains.32\nPrivate labels are rapidly gaining ground in a way that has many manufacturers of name brands \nrunning scared. Recessions increase private-label sales, and once some consumers switch to a private \nlabel, they don\u2019t always go back.33 However, some experts believe 50 percent is the natural limit on \nhow much private-label volume to carry because consumers prefer certain national brands, and many \nproduct categories are not feasible or attractive on a private-label basis. In supermarkets, private labels \nare big sellers in milk and cheese, bread and baked goods, medications and remedies, paper products, \nfresh produce, and packaged meats.34\nWhy do retailers sponsor their own brands? First, these brands can be more profitable. Retailers \nmay be able to use manufacturers with excess capacity that will produce private-label goods at low cost. \nOther costs (such as research and development, advertising, sales promotion, and physical distribu -\ntion) are also much lower, so private labels can generate a higher profit margin.35 Retailers also develop \nexclusive store brands to differentiate themselves from competitors. Many price-sensitive consumers \nprefer store brands in certain categories. These preferences give retailers increased bargaining power \nwith marketers of national brands.36\nWe should distinguish private-label or store brands from generics. Generics  are unbranded, plainly \npackaged, less expensive versions of common products such as spaghetti, paper towels, and canned \npeaches. They offer standard or lower quality at a price that may be as much as 20 percent to 40 percent \nlower than nationally advertised brands and 10 percent to 20 percent lower than the retailer\u2019s private-\nlabel brands. The lower price is made possible by lower-cost labeling and packaging and minimal \nadvertising, and sometimes by lower-quality ingredients.\nRetailers are building better quality into their store brands and emphasizing attractive, innovative \npackaging. Supermarket retailers are adding premium store-brand items. When Kroger\u2019s switched to \nnew vendors to supply higher-quality cheeses, meats, and veggies for its upscale private-label pizza, \nsales soared; the supermarket chain now owns 60 percent of the premium pizza market in its stores.37 \nOne of the most successful supermarket retailers with private labels is Canada\u2019s Loblaws.\nLoblaws  Since 1984, when its President\u2019s Choice line of foods made its debut, the term \nprivate label  has brought Loblaws instantly to mind. the toronto-based company\u2019s Decadent \nChocolate Chip Cookie quickly became a Canadian leader and showed how innovative store \nbrands could compete effectively with national brands by matching or even exceeding their \nquality. A finely tuned brand strategy for its premium President\u2019s Choice line and its no-frills, \nyellow-labeled No Name line has helped differentiate its stores and has built Loblaws into a \npowerhouse in Canada and the United States. the President\u2019s Choice line has become so \nsuccessful that Loblaws is licensing it to noncompetitive retailers in other countries. to complete \na \u201cgood, better, best\u201d brand portfolio, Loblaws has also introduced an \u201caffordable luxury\u201d line of \nmore than 200 President\u2019s Choice food products under a distinctive \u201cBlack Label\u201d design.

A steady stream of brand extensions and line extensions has \nblurred brand identity at times and led to a confusing amount of product proliferation.\nBucking these trends, many manufacturers of national brands are fighting back. To stay a step \nahead of store brands, leading brand marketers are investing significantly in research and development \nto bring out new brands, line extensions, features, and quality improvements. They are also investing \nin strong \u201cpull\u201d advertising programs to maintain high brand recognition and consumer preference \nand to overcome the in-store marketing advantage that private labels can enjoy.\nTop-brand marketers also are seeking to partner with major mass distributors in a joint search \nfor logistical economies and competitive strategies that produce savings for both sides. Cutting all \nunnecessary costs allows national brands to command a price premium, although price can\u2019t exceed \nconsumers\u2019 perception of value.\nResearchers offer four strategic recommendations for manufacturers to compete against or col -\nlaborate with private labels.39\n\u2022 Fight selectively  when manufacturers can win against private labels and add value for consumers, \nretailers, and shareholders. This typically occurs when the brand is number one or two in the cat -\negory or occupies a premium niche position. Procter & Gamble rationalized its portfolio, selling \noff various brands such as Sunny Delight juice drink, Jif peanut butter, and Crisco shortening, in \npart so it could concentrate on strengthening its 20-plus brands with more than $1 billion in sales.\n\u2022 Partner effectively  by seeking win\u2013win relationships with retailers through strategies that complement \nthe retailer\u2019s private labels. Est\u00e9e Lauder created four brands (American Beauty, Flirt, Good Skin, \nand Grassroots) exclusively for Kohl\u2019s to help the retailer generate volume and protect its more \nprestigious brands in the process. Manufacturers selling through hard discounters such as Lidl and \nAldi have increased sales by finding new customers who have not previously bought the brand.\n\u2022 Innovate brilliantly  with new products to help beat private labels. Continuously launching incre -\nmentally new products keeps the manufacturer brands looking fresh, but the firm must also peri -\nodically launch radically new products and protect the intellectual property of all brands. Kraft \ndoubled the number of its patent lawyers to make sure its innovations were legally protected as \nmuch as possible.\n\u2022 Create winning value propositions  by imbuing brands with symbolic imagery as well as functional qual -\nity that beats private labels. Too many manufacturer brands have let private labels equal them, and \nsometimes better them, on functional quality. In addition, to have a winning value proposition, \nmarketers need to monitor pricing and ensure that perceived benefits equal the price premium.<< Loblaws\u2019 line of \ndistinctively packaged \nPresident\u2019s Choice \nfoods is indicative of the \nincreasing quality and \nsuccess of private-label \nbrands.\nSource: Helen Sessions/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e6f062c-a4f9-431b-9373-992229a450bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e6f062c-a4f9-431b-9373-992229a450bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63320276-53f1-4c0a-a9ce-cd623de8abe3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "42e340dc7ec2272558ac070f8e215271cf23042c86ae8fbb628cf82a2792927a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e22ed5c-3e31-4cfa-a7cf-cac95fa6b77e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap16.pdf"}, "hash": "4fe0cfc87d14476adafba32a5627ec057e59bf3274ff0556f780a68c80d7e7d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5445dc7-1793-4948-81cf-1f862ee73944", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbdd96a70b072144aee277a4a1bfefd618fd2e1324748cc4759fe67bdfba1570", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "364 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nCreating strong consumer demand is crucial. When Walmart decided to pull Hefty and Glad food \nbags from its shelves, selling just Ziploc and its own Great Value brand, Hefty and Glad stood to lose \nbecause the retail giant accounted for a third of their sales. When consumers complained about the \nloss of these and other brands and switched some of their shopping to other stores, Walmart relented \nand put Hefty and Glad back on the shelves.\nWholesaling\nWholesaling  includes all the activities involved in selling goods or services to those who buy for \nresale or who make large purchases for business use. Wholesalers buy large quantities of goods from \nvarious producers or vendors, warehouse them, and resell them to retailers who, in turn, sell them \nto the general public.\nTHE BUSINESS OF WHOLESALING\nWholesalers differ from retailers in a number of ways. First, wholesalers pay less attention to promo -\ntion, atmosphere, and location because they are dealing with business customers rather than final \nconsumers. Second, wholesale transactions are usually larger than retail transactions, and wholesalers \nusually cover a larger trade area than retailers. Third, wholesalers and retailers are subject to different \nlegal regulations and taxes.\nBased on their transactions with buyers and sellers, wholesalers can be divided into two main \ngroups:\n\u2022 Merchant wholesalers  typically buy directly from the manufacturer, take title to the merchan -\ndise they handle, store the product, and then sell it to the customer. Merchant wholesalers vary \nin the level of service they offer. Full-service wholesalers  can provide a vast array of supplementary \nfunctions, such as maintaining a sales force to promote the products, offering credit, making \ndeliveries, and providing management assistance. In contrast, limited-service wholesalers  offer few \nif any extra services and instead aim to offer lower prices on merchandise. For example, cash and \ncarry wholesalers  sell a limited line of fast-moving goods to small retailers in a no-frills environment, \nonly for cash, and with limited return privileges or no-return policies.\n\u2022 Brokers and agents  differ from merchant wholesalers in that they typically do not take ownership \nof the goods they buy and sell. Instead, they arrange for the sale of goods between the merchant \nwholesaler and the retailer and receive a fee for the arrangement of the sale. Brokers bring buyers \nand sellers together and assist in negotiation; they are paid by the party hiring them\u2014food brokers, \nreal estate brokers, insurance brokers. Agents represent buyers or sellers on a more permanent \nbasis and aim to facilitate buying and selling, on commission typically based on the selling price.\nWholesalers play a key role by serving as an intermediary between manufacturers and retailers. \nThey are particularly important in industries with fragmented retail outlets, where they provide dis -\ntribution and related services, helping to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of operations. \nConsider AmerisourceBergen\u2014one of the largest wholesalers in the United States.\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation  AmerisourceBergen Corporation is an American drug \nwholesale company that distributes brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-\ncounter (O tC) health care products and equipment, to a wide variety of health care providers such as \nhospitals and health systems, retail pharmacies, mail-order facilities, physicians, clinics, and assisted-\nliving centers. the company was formed in 2001 by the merger of Bergen Brunswig and AmeriSource \nHealth Corporation\u2014two of the largest U.S. wholesale drug companies.

Wholesalers\u2019 sales forces help manufacturers reach many small \nretailers and business customers at a relatively low cost. They have more contacts, and buyers \noften trust them more than they trust a distant manufacturer.\n\u2022 Buying and assortment building.  Wholesalers are able to select items and build the assortments their \ncustomers need, saving them considerable time, money, and effort.\n\u2022 Bulk breaking.  Wholesalers achieve savings for their customers by buying large carload lots and \nbreaking the bulk into smaller units.\n\u2022 Warehousing.  Wholesalers hold inventories, thereby reducing inventory costs and risks to suppliers \nand customers.\n\u2022 Transportation.  Wholesalers can often provide quicker delivery to buyers because they are closer \nto the buyers.\n\u2022 Financing.  Wholesalers finance customers by granting credit, and they finance suppliers by \nordering early and paying bills on time.\n\u2022 Risk bearing.  Wholesalers absorb some risk by taking title to goods and bearing the cost of theft, \ndamage, spoilage, and obsolescence.\n\u2022 Market research.  Wholesalers provide both suppliers and customers with information about com -\npetitors\u2019 activities, such as new products and price developments.\n\u2022 Management services and consulting.  Wholesalers often help retailers improve their operations \nby training sales clerks, helping with store layouts and displays, and setting up accounting and \ninventory-control systems. They may help industrial customers by offering training and techni -\ncal services.\nWholesaler\u2013distributors have faced mounting pressure in recent years from new sources of com -\npetition, including digital platforms such as Alibaba, demanding customers, new technologies, and \nmore direct-buying programs by large industrial, institutional, and retail buyers.

They are also reducing operating costs by investing in more advanced information \nsystems, materials-handling technology, and digital technologies. Finally, they are improving their \nstrategic decisions about target markets, product assortment and services, price, communication, and \ndistribution.\nThe wholesaling industry remains vulnerable to one of the most enduring trends: fierce resistance \nto price increases and the winnowing out of suppliers based on cost and quality. The trend toward \nvertical integration, in which manufacturers try to control or own their intermediaries, is still strong.\nmarketing\nINSIGH t\ndepicts the key drivers of price image and their related \nimpact on consumer behavior.\n\u2022 Average price level.  Price image does indeed hinge \non the actual prices of the items carried by a par -\nticular retailer, although not entirely. A store in which \nprices are substantially above those of its competi-\ntors will find it difficult to convince customers that it is \nnot high priced, regardless of other measures it may \ntake to change its price image.\n\u2022 Known-value items.  Consumers typically do not \nexamine all prices at a store; instead, they tend to \nfocus on items whose prices they are familiar with, \nwhich are referred to as known-value or signpost \nitems. Because shoppers are aware of the prices for \nthese items at other stores, they use them to deter -\nmine whether or not a particular price is competi-\ntive. Known-value items usually fall into the category \nof frequently purchased items like milk, soda, and \nsnacks, allowing consumers to readily compare \nprices across different stores.\n\u2022 Price range.  Consumers form an assessment of \nprice image not just from the average level of prices \nat a retailer, but also from the range of prices within Price image  reflects the general perception that con-\nsumers have about the level of prices at a given retailer. \nFor example, Walmart is often regarded as being rather \ninexpensive, whereas target is usually considered to be \nmoderately priced. Price image differs from price, which \nis quantitatively expressed; price image is qualitative in \nnature. this means that consumers regard a retailer\u2019s \npricing in categorical terms such as \u201cexpensive\u201d or \u201cinex-\npensive.\u201d Price image resides in the minds of the buyers; \nthus, it is based on consumers\u2019 perception of prices at a \nparticular retailer compared to other retailers and may not \nbe an accurate reflection of the actual level of a retailer\u2019s \nprices.\nMany managers mistakenly believe that price image \nis based solely on the prices within a specific store and \nthat managing price image is as simple as adjusting the \nprices of items the store carries. this results in the theory \nthat a retailer can lower its price image by lowering the \nprices of items in its assortment.\nHowever, this method of resetting price image has \nnot proved effective. Low or high prices are an important \nfactor in the formation of a retailer\u2019s price image, but \nprices are not the only things that consumers consider \nwhen forming a judgment about price image.

A store located \nin a prime area populated by luxury retailers and fea-\nturing exquisite d\u00e9cor and high-end amenities is likely \nto be associated with high operating costs that signal \na higher price image. On the other hand, large stores \nin shopping malls with expansive parking lots are \nlikely to signal the high sales volume that consumers \nassociate with a lower price image.\n\u2022 Service level.  Another highly visible aspect that \ncontributes to a retailer\u2019s price image is the level \nof service offered. In general, consumers tend to \nassociate higher levels of service with a higher \nprice image, whatever the retailer\u2019s actual prices, \nbecause they assume that offering better service \nincreases the retailer\u2019s costs, which is likely to elevate \nretailer\u00a0prices.\n\u2022 Store policies.  Customers might also form their price \nimage of a retailer on the basis of its price-related \npolicies. thus, policies, such as a price-match \nguarantee, that reveal the store\u2019s commitment to the store. If, in addition to commonly purchased \nknown-value items, a retailer carries a few extremely \nhigh-priced items, that retailer is likely to have a \nhigher price image than a retailer that carries a few \nextremely low-priced items along with the most com-\nmonly purchased items.\n\u2022 Sales promotions.  Consumers\u2019 price image might \nalso be affected by how prices vary over time, par -\nticularly because of sales promotions. No consistent \nempirical evidence exists to support the conventional \nwisdom suggesting that everyday low pricing (EDLP) \nconveys a lower price image to consumers than high\u2013\nlow (HiLo) pricing, with its temporary deep discounts \non high-priced items. Actually, HiLo pricing can often \nelicit a lower price image than EDLP, even when the \naverage price level is the same.\n\u2022 Price communication.

One of Uniqlo\u2019s first business \nchallenges was to overcome customer perception. Because \nUniqlo sold casual clothing at low cost, people believed \nthat its garments were of low quality. It wasn\u2019t until 1998, \nwhen Uniqlo opened a three-story store in Harajuku, one of \ntokyo\u2019s most popular shopping destinations, that consumer \nperception changed. Consumers noticed that Uniqlo was \nselling high-quality fleece jackets at affordable prices. this \nprecipitated a complete shift in customer perception of the \nbrand\u2014from cheap apparel to high-quality, affordable casual \nwear. By the end of 1998, Uniqlo had expanded to over \n300\u00a0stores across Japan.\nCompared to other popular clothing retailers, Uniqlo\u2019s \nbrand philosophy takes a very simple and inclusive approach. \nIts brand message is that \u201cUniqlo is a modern Japanese \ncompany that inspires the world to dress casual.\u201d Unlike \nclothing retailers such as Zara and H&M, Uniqlo does not \nseek to follow fashion trends. Instead, Uniqlo designs and \nmarkets its clothing to be accessible and universal, a key \ningredient in the company\u2019s success. this is embodied in \nUniqlo\u2019s brand motto, \u201cMade for All.\u201d Uniqlo has designed its \nclothing to appeal to all consumers, regardless of age, eth-\nnicity, or gender. the clothing is basic but still allows wearers \nto express their own sense of style by pairing it with other \ngarments and accessories.\nUniqlo creates products for three primary segments: \nwomen, men, and children, including babies. In each of these \nthree segments, Uniqlo sells five different types of clothing: \nouterwear, tops, bottoms, inner-wear, and home-wear. In the \nouterwear category, Uniqlo is known for its Ultra-Light Down \njacket, which is light and thin but still provides excellent insu-\nlation. tops include mainly basic dresses, blouses, t-shirts, \npolos, and sweaters. Uniqlo\u2019s bottoms include pants, shorts, \nskirts, and leggings. Uniqlo offers designer collections in \nthe tops and bottoms categories, for those seeking a more \nstylish flair to their wardrobes. Most Uniqlo inner-wear and \nhome-wear is specifically designed with comfort in mind, \nvarying in breathability and warmth.\nAnother aspect of Uniqlo\u2019s success is its clothing design \nand innovation. Yanai frequently affirms that Uniqlo is not a \nfashion company, but rather a technology company. Uniqlo \nhas invested in improving the performance of its clothes \nthrough technological innovations. Heat tech fabric creates \nheat from moisture and locks in the heat with air pockets \nembedded in the fabric. AIRism fabric is light and stretchy \nand maintains breathability across many temperatures. Life-\nwear crosses sportswear and casual wear and is designed \nto be an everyday piece of clothing. By branding these fabric innovations and emphasizing superior performance and func-\ntionality, Uniqlo distinguishes its clothing from that of other \nlow-cost value retailers.\nYet another factor in Uniqlo\u2019s success is that it is able \nto sell functional and quality clothing at low prices. After \ndiscovering that many of the popular foreign clothing chains \n(such as Gap and Benetton) were vertically integrated, tadashi \nYanai followed suit to take full control of product design, \nproduction, and retailing. Fast-fashion retailers design their \nsupply chain to respond to rapidly changing fashion trends \nin as little as two weeks. Uniqlo instead plans its production \nof essentials and basics months in advance. the company \naligns production with its marketing campaigns to adjust \nquantities based on consumer demand, and staff members \nvisit production plants to ensure that new clothes are of \nUniqlo quality.\nto build its brand, Uniqlo uses many different methods \nbeyond traditional tV commercials and flyers. One approach \nis a strong emphasis on the in-store experience. Bright \nlights, combined with neatly stacked displays and efficient \norganization, convey Uniqlo\u2019s message of simplicity and \naccessibility. Digital screens that explain the benefits of \nUniqlo\u2019s innovations and styles are strategically placed in \nopen areas. Uniqlo has also committed to creating distinct \ncustomer service.

Sound of Music had expanded to seven locations by \n1983, when the name was changed to Best Buy to reflect \ncompetitive prices and an increased product assortment \nthat included home appliances, computer equipment, video \ngames, and home theater systems.\nBy the early 2010s, Best Buy was facing  numerous \n business challenges. In particular, showrooming had \nbecome a trend that negatively affected electronics retailers. \n Customers would walk into stores to check out electronics and \n appliances\u2014and then purchase the products for less money \nfrom other retailers such as Amazon. Best Buy had formerly \nattracted many customers for products such as CDs and \nDVDs. However, these products were becoming obsolete as \nmusic, movies, and video games moved to digital  platforms. \nCompetitors like RadioShack, Circuit City, and hhgregg had \nalready shut down or filed for bankruptcy, and Best Buy was \nfacing the grim prospect of meeting the same fate.\nBest Buy started to turn its business around when \nHubert Joly joined as the new CEO in mid-2012. Joly, who \nhad previously served as CEO for Carlson Wagonlit travel, an \nAmerican hotel and travel conglomerate, looked to reshape \nshowrooming from a threatening issue into a successful busi-\nness strategy. In addition, he sought to drastically improve \nthe service aspect of Best Buy to retain customers and earn \ntheir loyalty.\nOne of Joly\u2019s most important changes was Best Buy\u2019s \nprice-match guarantee. through price-comparison apps, \ncustomers saw that companies like Amazon nearly always \noffered the same product at a lower price. It seemed there \nwas no reason to purchase products at Best Buy; custom-\ners were better off looking at products in store and ordering \nonline. Although the guarantee was costly, price matching \ngave customers a reason to purchase their products at a \nBest Buy store instead of at a competitor\u2019s.\nBest Buy took advantage of showrooming by partnering \nwith many electronics companies (such as Apple, Samsung, \nand Microsoft) to feature their products in branded displays. \nOriginally, Best Buy placed products from these companies \nnext to one another in the areas that offered different types of \nelectronic products. With its new partnerships in place, Best \nBuy now presents the products of each of these companies \nin dedicated kiosks. For example, Apple kiosks have the \nsame minimalist design seen in Apple stores.
