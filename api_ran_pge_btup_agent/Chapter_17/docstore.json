Competition grows more intense \nevery year. Global competitors are eager to enter new markets, online competitors seek cost-efficient \nways to expand distribution, private-label and store brands offer low-price alternatives, and brand \nextensions are moving mega-brands into new categories. For these reasons and more, product and \nbrand fortunes change over time, and marketers must respond accordingly.\nAssessing Growth Opportunities\nAssessing growth opportunities includes planning new businesses, downsizing, and terminating \nolder businesses. If there is a gap between future desired sales and projected sales, corporate man -\nagement will need to develop or acquire new businesses to fill it.\nThere are two main considerations in assessing growth opportunities. The first concerns the \ntypes of products and markets a company should focus on. The second involves the ways in which a \ncompany can manage its product\u2013market growth strategy over time. We discuss these options in the \nfollowing sections.\nPRODUCT\u2013MARKET GROWTH STRATEGIES\nCorporate management should constantly review opportunities for improving existing businesses. \nOne popular framework is the Product\u2013Market Growth framework , also known as the Ansoff \nmatrix. It outlines four key sales-growth strategies that tie the company\u2019s customer segments to \nopportunities for product development.2 The framework evaluates the strategic growth opportuni -\nties for a firm in terms of current and new products and markets.\nThe company first considers whether it could gain more market share with its current products \nin their current markets using a market-penetration strategy . Next, it considers whether it can find or \ndevelop new markets for its current products using a market-development strategy. Then it considers \nwhether it can develop new products for its current markets with a product-development strategy . \nLater, the firm will also review opportunities to develop new products for new markets through a \ndiversification strategy. The four strategies that make up the Product\u2013Market Growth framework are \nillustrated in Figure 17.1.\nLearning Objectives  After reading this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3332, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5cc0342-ad16-42ac-8495-83b576e58386": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5cc0342-ad16-42ac-8495-83b576e58386", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c54acb2c-53e6-40fa-a16b-6b3e63e27a28", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "33582cbe9a6f4cc6961504a8103ecf2ff4af784ea97d46d2859d1f623625835d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9840fe1-8919-47db-b6bb-4738652a7467", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "8a5c7a298355e5a56912592fb39a84a7cf9039719e7b1332c4820f2431c9424c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03ba4002-da07-40ac-99ea-5fd10ec2c2bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78ff23dc8c7df6b8b5b8db72c7e1834b2134fba8204c7f76db3291f7ac76ef87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "374 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nFIGURE 17.1 \nThe Product\u2013Market \nGrowth Framework\nMarket\ndevelopment\nProduct\ndevelopmentNew\nproductsCurrent\nproductsCurrent\ncustomersNew\ncustomers\nMarket\npenetration\nDiversification\nConsider how ESPN has pursued a variety of growth opportunities.\nThe market-penetration strategy , which \ninvolves growing sales of the company\u2019s current \nofferings to its existing customers, is often the \neasiest to implement. To implement this strategy, \nthe company could try to encourage its customers \nto buy more by demonstrating the benefits of its \nproducts. Alternatively, it might identify new uses \nfor its current products and educate customers to \nuse these products to fulfill different needs.\nHow can a company use a market-  \ndevelopment strategy ? First, it might try to iden -\ntify potential user groups in the current sales areas. \nIf it has been selling only to consumer markets, it \nmight go after office and factory markets. Second, \nit might seek additional distribution channels by \nadding mass merchandising or online channels. \nThird, the company might sell in new locations in \nits home country or abroad.\nManagement should also consider a product-\ndevelopment strategy . Thus, a company could \ndevelop new product features, offer different sets \nof benefits at different price tiers, or research an \nalternative technology to develop a viable substi -\ntute for its current products.\nFinally, growth via a diversification \n strategy  makes sense when good opportunities \nexist outside the present businesses\u2014i.e., the \nindustry is highly attractive, and the company has \nthe right mix of business strengths to succeed. \nFrom its origins as an animated film producer, The \nWalt  Disney Company has moved into licensing \ncharacters for merchandised goods, publishing >> A vow to expand its brand by being wherever fans watched, read about, \nand discussed sports took ESPN from a regional broadcaster to the biggest \nname in sports, operating a variety of media and other businesses in nearly \n200 countries and territories.\nSource: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy Stock PhotoESPN  Through its singular focus on sports programming and news, ESPN grew from a small \nregional broadcaster into the biggest name in sports. In the early 1990s, the company crafted a \nwell-thought-out plan: Wherever sports fans watched, read, and discussed sports, ESPN would \nbe there. It pursued this strategy by expanding its brand, and it now encompasses 10\u00a0cable \nchannels, a magazine, a few restaurants (ESPN Zone), more than 600 local radio affiliates, \noriginal movies and television series, book publishing, a sports merchandise catalog and online \nstore, music and video games, and a mobile service.

First, the company could choose a concentric strategy \nand seek new products that have technological or marketing synergies with existing product lines, even \nthough they appeal to a different group of customers. Second, it might use a horizontal strategy and \nproduce complementary products, even though they might require a different manufacturing process. \nFinally, the company might seek new businesses with no relationship to its current technology, prod -\nucts, or markets, adopting a conglomerate strategy.\nGROWTH THROUGH MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS\nA company can grow in two ways: by increasing output and enhancing revenues and profits inter -\nnally (an approach that is commonly referred to as organic growth ) or by relying on mergers and \nacquisitions. Market-penetration and market-development strategies typically follow the path of \norganic growth, whereas product development and diversification can involve both organic growth \nand growth by mergers and acquisitions. Here we focus on using mergers and acquisitions to grow \nthe company\u2019s market position.\nA business can increase sales and profits through backward, forward, or horizontal integration \nwithin its industry. Merck formed joint ventures as far back as 1989 with Johnson & Johnson to sell \nover-the-counter pharmaceuticals and then, in 1991, with DuPont to expand basic research. In 1997, \nMerck and Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc S.A. (now Sanofi S.A.) combined their animal health and poultry genetics \nbusinesses to form Merial Limited, a fully integrated animal health company. Merck then acquired \nSchering-Plough in 2009, Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2014, Afferent Pharmaceuticals in 2016, and \nAntelliq in 2018.4\nHorizontal mergers and alliances don\u2019t always work out. The merger between Sears and Kmart \ndidn\u2019t solve either retailer\u2019s problems. Nextel Communications Inc. merged with Sprint in 2005 in \nwhat was considered one of the worst mergers of the decade, in part because of their incompatible \nnetworks.5 In the same vein, United\u2019s merger with Continental made sense strategically and financially, \nbut logistical problems seemed endless because the two airlines ran their businesses in very different \nways, from boarding procedures to the manner in which they brought planes into the gate.\nHow might a company use mergers and acquisitions to grow its business? The company might \nacquire one or more of its suppliers to gain more control or generate more profit through backward \nintegration. It might acquire some wholesalers or retailers, especially if they are highly profitable, in \nforward integration. Finally, the company might acquire one or more competitors, provided the gov -\nernment does not bar this horizontal integration.6 However, these new sources may not deliver the \ndesired sales volume. In that case, the company must consider diversification.\nIn addition to considering new market opportunities, a company must carefully prune, harvest, \nor divest itself of tired old businesses to release needed resources for other uses and reduce costs. To \nfocus on its travel and credit card operations, American Express spun off American Express Finan -\ncial Advisors, which provided insurance, mutual funds, investment advice, and brokerage and asset-\nmanagement services (it was renamed Ameriprise Financial). American International Group (AIG) \nagreed to sell two of its subunits\u2014American General Indemnity Co. and American General Property \nInsurance Co.\u2014to White Mountains Insurance Group as part of a long-term growth strategy to discard \nredundant assets and focus on its core operations.\nThe more diversified a company\u2019s business portfolio is, the greater the likelihood that at some \npoint it will need to downsize its business operations and/or divest itself of business units. Thus, to \nstreamline its business and meet its current financial obligations, GE divested itself of multiple divi -\nsions, including its transportation-finance unit sold to Canada's Bank of Montr\u00e9al, its appliance division \nsold to Chinese consumer electronics and home appliances company Haier Group, and its Industrial \nSolutions Business sold to the Swiss\u2013Swedish multinational conglomerate ABB.

However, another firm can come along and copy \nor improve on the new product. Although it may not overtake the leader, the follower can achieve \nhigh profits because it did not bear any of the innovation expense.\nMany companies prefer to follow rather than challenge the market leader. Patterns of \u201cconscious \nparallelism\u201d are common in capital-intensive, homogeneous-product industries such as steel, fertil -\nizers, and chemicals. The opportunities for product differentiation and image differentiation are low, \nservice quality is comparable, and price sensitivity runs high. The mood in these industries is against \nshort-run grabs for market share because that only provokes retaliation. Instead, most firms present \nsimilar offers to buyers, usually by copying the leader. Market shares show high stability.\nThat\u2019s not to say market followers lack strategies. They must know how to hold current custom -\ners and win a fair share of new ones. Each follower tries to bring distinctive advantages to its target \nmarket\u2014location, services, financing\u2014while defensively keeping its manufacturing costs low and its \nproduct quality and services high. It must also enter new markets as they open up.\nFollowers must define a growth path, but one that doesn\u2019t invite competitive retaliation. We dis -\ntinguish three broad strategies:\n\u2022 Cloner.  The cloner emulates the leader\u2019s products, name, and packaging with slight variations. \nTechnology firms are often accused of being cloners: Similar-sounding knockoffs copy mobile-\nmessaging app maker WhatsApp\u2019s products, and Berlin-based Rocket Internet has copied \ncompetitors\u2019 business models and attempted to out-execute them.8 Ralston Foods, now owned by \nConAgra, sells imitations of name-brand cereals in look-alike boxes as part of its \u201cValue+Brands\u201d \nplatform. Its Apple Cinnamon Tasteeos (versus Cheerios), Cocoa Crunchies (versus Cocoa Puffs), \nand Corn Biscuits (versus Corn Chex) take aim at successful General Mills brands, but with much \nlower price points.9\n\u2022 Imitator.  The imitator copies some things from the leader but differentiates on packaging, \nadvertising, pricing, or location. The leader doesn\u2019t mind as long as the imitator doesn\u2019t attack \naggressively. Fernandez Pujals grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and took Domino\u2019s pizza home \ndelivery idea to Spain, where he borrowed $80,000 to open his first store in Madrid. His Telepizza \nchain operates more than 1600 locations including company stores and franchise stores in twenty-\nthree countries.10\n\u2022 Adapter.  The adapter takes the leader\u2019s products and adapts or improves them. The adapter may \nchoose to sell to different markets, but often it grows into a future challenger, as many Japanese \nfirms have done after improving products developed elsewhere.\nNote that these three follower strategies are not to be confused with illegal and unethical follower \nstrategies. Counterfeiters duplicate the leader\u2019s product and packages and sell them on the black market \nor through disreputable dealers. High-tech firms like Apple and luxury brands like Rolex have been \nplagued by the counterfeiter problem for years, especially in Asia. Pharmaceutical counterfeits have \nbecome an enormous and potentially lethal $75 billion business. Unregulated, drug fakes have been \nfound to contain traces of chalk, brick dust, paint, and even pesticides.11\nFollowership is often a rewarding path. Some follower firms have found success, but in another \nindustry. Les Wexner, who used to run Limited Brands and its Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie retailer, fully \nembraces imitation. One month a year, he travels the world looking for ideas he can borrow from other \ncompanies ranging from airlines to consumer-goods makers.12\nGaining Market Position\nAn important function of marketing is to drive the growth of company sales and revenue. Good mar -\nketing can help to attract consumers, induce them to try out the company\u2019s products, and promote \nword of mouth and diffusion.\nA company\u2019s market position  can be defined on three dimensions:\n\u2022 Share of market.  Market share is measured by the company\u2019s sales revenue or the number of com -\npany units sold relative to the total revenue or total units sold in a specific market.\n\u2022 Share of mind.  This is defined by the percentage of customers who regard the company as the first \ncompany that comes to mind in a specific industry.\n\u2022 Share of heart.

We could generalize as follows: Compa -\nnies that make steady gains in mind share and heart share will inevitably make gains in market share and profitability.  \nFirms such as Apple, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and Warby Parker are all reaping the benefits of providing \nemotional, experiential, social, and financial value to satisfy customers and all their constituents.13\nA market leader  has the largest market share and usually leads in price changes, new-product \nintroductions, distribution coverage, and promotional intensity. Some historical market leaders include \nMicrosoft (computer software), Gatorade (sports drinks), Best Buy (retail electronics), McDonald\u2019s (fast \nfood), Blue Cross Blue Shield (health insurance), and Visa (credit cards).\nAlthough marketers assume well-known brands are distinctive in consumers\u2019 minds, unless a \ndominant firm enjoys a legal monopoly, it must maintain constant vigilance. A powerful product \ninnovation might come along, a competitor might find a fresh marketing angle or commit to a major \nmarketing investment, or the leader\u2019s cost structure might spiral upward. One well-known brand and \nmarket leader that has worked hard to stay on top is Xerox.\nXerox  Xerox has had to become much more than just a copier company. Now a blue-chip \ncompany with the name that became a verb, the company sports the broadest array of imaging \nproducts and dominates the market for high-end printing systems, while also offering a new \nrange of printing and business-related services. It has made a product-line transition from the \nold light lens technology to digital systems and is finding ways to make color copying less \nexpensive and even to print in 3-D. Xerox provides broad document and print-manager services \nto help companies lower costs by eliminating desktop printers, reducing paper use, and installing \nmultifunction multi-user devices that are more efficient, break down less, and use cheaper \nsupplies. Xerox is also becoming more of a services company, providing bill processing, business \nprocessing, and IT outsourcing. The acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) allowed \nXerox to plunge its technology into back-office operations. A call to an airline\u2019s customer service, \na paper or online submission of a health insurance claim, and a query to solve a smart-phone \nproblem all might be handled by a Xerox employee. In early 2017, Xerox spun off its business \nservices division into a separate corporation, Conduent, enabling Xerox to focus on its document \ntechnology and document outsourcing business.14\nTo gain and defend market position, a firm might first find ways to grow sales from current cus -\ntomers. Second, it might expand total market demand by creating new markets. Third, it must protect \nits current share through effective defensive and offensive actions. Let\u2019s look at each strategy.\nGROWING SALES TO CURRENT CUSTOMERS\nMarketers can try to increase the amount, level, or frequency of consumption. They can sometimes \nboost the amount  through packaging or product redesign. Larger package sizes increase the amount \nof product that consumers use at one time.15 Consumers also use more impulse products, such as \nsoft drinks and snacks, when the product is made more readily available.\nIronically, some food firms such as Hershey\u2019s have developed smaller packaging sizes that have \nactually increased sales volume through more frequent usage.16 In general, increasing frequency  of con -\nsumption requires either identifying additional occasions to use the company\u2019s offerings or identifying \ncompletely new and different ways to use the offerings.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4065, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2abda1a7-64dd-48a1-800b-f6542746d925": {"__data__": {"id_": "2abda1a7-64dd-48a1-800b-f6542746d925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "425d2575-0300-4af5-8d5e-37ce3b1da37f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "5a354d1ac7202fea23f5838dc7f622f9a2b96f5ff799f3432d803a8dd31e704c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3390752c-5f82-410f-b541-310ac84bf489", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "41ec10e34c2754deb61b72b87b48a9fbba0176bbc6cf9374bd17973acab3cf1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2efe12e9-ba05-4c38-8fab-10fb12df2004", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d71991f27b591b77ad24207b576df3fe08f79d0b234803c426f61a27714c37a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "378 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nIdentifying New Occasions for Usage.  A marketing program can communicate the appro -\npriateness and advantages of using the brand. Pepto-Bismol stomach remedies are in 40 percent of \nU.S. households, but only 7 percent of people claim to have used them in the previous 12 months. To \nexpand usage and make the brand more top of mind, a holiday campaign linked Pepto-Bismol to party \nfestivities and celebrations with the tag line \u201cEat, Drink, and Be Covered.\u201d In a somewhat similar vein, \nthe inside front flap of Orbit chewing gum packages contain the message \u201cEat. Drink. Chew. A Good \nClean Feeling.\u201d to reinforce that the brand can be a substitute for brushing teeth.17\nAnother opportunity to increase usage arises when consumers\u2019 perceptions of their usage differ \nfrom reality. Consumers may fail to replace a short-lived product when they should, simply because \nthey overestimate how long it stays fresh or operates effectively.18 One strategy is to tie the act of replac -\ning the product to a holiday, event, or time of year. Marketers of household products such as batteries \nfor smoke alarms and filters for vacuum cleaners, furnaces, and air conditioners use the beginning and \nend of Daylight Savings Time as points to remind consumers to replace old batteries with new ones.\nOther approach are (1) to provide consumers with better information about when they first used \nthe product or need to replace it and (2) to incorporate a gauge of the current level of product perfor -\nmance. Gillette razor cartridges feature colored stripes that slowly fade with repeated use, signaling the \nuser to move on to the next cartridge. Marketers for Monroe shock absorbers and struts launched the \nclever, fully integrated \u201cEverything Gets Old. Even Your Shocks.\u201d campaign, which drew comparisons \nbetween worn shocks and struts and familiar consumer items that eventually wear out and need to be \nreplaced, such as shoes, socks, tires, and even bananas!19\nIdentifying New Uses.  The second approach to increasing frequency of consumption is to \nidentify completely new and different applications. Food product companies have long advertised \nrecipes that use their branded products in different ways. After discovering that some consumers used \nArm & Hammer baking soda as a refrigerator deodorant, the company launched a heavy promotion \ncampaign focusing on this use and succeeded in getting half the homes in the United States to adopt \nit. Next, the company expanded the brand into a variety of new-product categories such as toothpaste, \nantiperspirant, and laundry detergent.\nCREATING NEW MARKETS\nCompanies that plan to introduce a new product must decide when to do so. To be first in a market \ncan be rewarding, but it can also be risky and expensive. To come in later makes sense if the firm can \nbring superior technology, quality, and/or brand strength to create a market advantage.\nGaining a Pioneering Advantage.  Studies show that a market pioneer can gain great \nadvantage. Campbell\u2019s, Coca-Cola, Hallmark, and Amazon.com have enjoyed sustained market \ndominance. Nineteen of 25 market leaders in 1923 were still the market leaders 60 years later!20 In a \nsample of industrial-goods businesses, 66 percent of pioneers survived at least 10 years, compared with  \n48 percent of early followers.21\nWhat are the sources of the pioneer\u2019s advantage? Early users will recall the pioneer\u2019s brand name \nif the product satisfies them. The pioneer\u2019s brand also establishes what attributes the product class \nshould possess.22 It normally aims at the middle of the market and so captures more users. Customer \ninertia also plays a role, with customers displaying a reluctance to switch from their current option. >> Monroe advertises \nto remind consumers to \nmake sure they do not \nforget to change their \nshocks.\nSource: Monroe County Community College", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3894, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2efe12e9-ba05-4c38-8fab-10fb12df2004": {"__data__": {"id_": "2efe12e9-ba05-4c38-8fab-10fb12df2004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70f0c223-8c20-4e1a-b34f-e46ff1b68696", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "7f9eabe6eec3f3ce4dd4e8d866e08e3aa718101d26d9ab6eab6e2d3f157597fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2abda1a7-64dd-48a1-800b-f6542746d925", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "5a354d1ac7202fea23f5838dc7f622f9a2b96f5ff799f3432d803a8dd31e704c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2f5dea1-9ea3-4284-aea6-b34595475568", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc6395616da83cb5ad113cce54d03100d5ede27ac12c36a4eb1ac5c098ccf1d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 17    |  DRIvING GROWTH  IN COMPETITI vE MARkETS 379\nThere are also producer advantages: economies of scale, technological leadership, patents, ownership \nof scarce assets, and the ability to erect other barriers to entry.\nResearchers have identified five factors underpinning long-term market leadership: vision of a \nmass market, persistence, relentless innovation, financial commitment, and strategic assets.23 Other \nresearch has further highlighted the role of disruptive innovation.24 When a pioneer starts a market \nwith a really new product, such as the Segway Human Transporter, surviving can be very challenging. \nFor incremental innovators, survival rates are much higher.\nSpeeding up innovation is essential in an age of shortened product life cycles. Being early has been \nshown to pay. And yet, moving too quickly can be counterproductive. Companies should not move \nrapidly at the expense of careful design and execution of product-launch marketing. General Motors \nrushed out its newly designed Malibu to get a leg up on its Honda, Nissan, and Ford midsize competi -\ntors. But when all the different Malibu versions were not ready for production at launch, the brand\u2019s \nmomentum stalled.25\nThe pioneering advantage is not inevitable.26 Bowmar (hand calculators), Apple\u2019s Newton (per -\nsonal digital assistant), Netscape (Web browser), Reynolds (ballpoint pens), and Osborne (portable \ncomputers) were market pioneers overtaken by later entrants. First movers also have to watch out for \nthe shortcomings of being a pioneer.\nMarketers have identified several weaknesses among the failing pioneers. These include new prod -\nucts that were too crude, were improperly positioned, or appeared before there was strong demand; \nproduct-development costs that exhausted the innovator\u2019s resources; a lack of resources to compete \nagainst larger firms entering the market; and managerial incompetence or unhealthy complacency. \nSuccessful imitators thrived by offering lower prices, continuously improving the product, or using \nbrute market power to overtake the pioneer.\nResearchers raise further doubts about the pioneer advantage.27 They distinguish among an inven -\ntor, first to develop patents in a new-product category; a product pioneer,  first to develop a working model; \nand a market pioneer,  first to sell in the new-product category. Including non-surviving pioneers in their \nsample, they conclude that although pioneers may still have an advantage, more market pioneers fail \nthan has been reported, and more early market leaders (who were not pioneers) succeed. Later entrants \novertaking market pioneers through the years have included Matsushita over Sony in VCRs, GE over \nEMI in CAT scan equipment, and Google over Yahoo! in search.\nA longitudinal study of 625 brand leaders in 125 categories found that leading brands are more \nlikely to persist during economic slowdowns and when inflation is high; they are less likely to persist \nduring economic expansion and when inflation is low.28 Furthermore, half the leading brands in the \nsample lost their leading position after being a leader over periods ranging from 12 to 39 years. The \ndata further show that the rate of brand leadership persistence has been substantially lower in recent \neras than in earlier ones (e.g., more than 30 years ago) and that once brand leadership has been lost, it \nis rarely regained. Interestingly, the study found above-average rates of brand leadership persistence \nin the categories of food and household supplies, and below-average rates in durables and clothing.\nIdentifying Niche Markets.  An alternative to being a follower in a large market is to be a \nleader in a small market, or niche market. Smaller firms normally avoid competing with larger firms \nby targeting small markets of little or no interest to the larger firms. Over time, those markets can \nsometimes end up being sizable in their own right, as Huy Fong Foods has found.\nSriracha Hot Chili Sauce  David Tran started Huy Fong Foods in Los Angeles\u2019s \nChinatown in 1980, naming the company after the Taiwanese freighter that brought him to the \nUnited States as a refugee from vietnam.

They know their target customers so well that they can meet their needs better than other \nfirms by offering high value, but they can also charge a premium price, achieve lower manufacturing \ncosts, and shape a strong corporate culture and vision. The niche marketer  achieves high margin, \nwhereas the mass marketer achieves high volume.\nThe guiding principle in successful nichemanship is specialization. Here are two common types \nof specialization:\n\u2022 Customer specialist.  The firm specializes in one type of end-use customer. For example, a  \nvalue-added reseller  customizes computer hardware and software for specific customer segments \nand earns a price premium in the process. The firm sells only to customers in a certain locality, \nregion, or area of the world.\n\u2022 Product or service specialist.  The firm carries or produces only one product line or product. \nA copper producer may concentrate on producing raw copper, copper components, or finished \ncopper products. A manufacturer may produce only lenses for microscopes. A retailer may carry \nonly ties. The firm offers one or more services not available from other firms. A bank might take \nloan requests over the phone and hand-deliver the money to the customer.\nPaul Reed Smith founded PRS Guitars to compete with big rivals Fender and Gibson and supply \n\u201cthe Stradivarius of guitars.\u201d PRS instruments are carefully constructed of selected mahogany and \nfigured maple, kiln-dried and sanded five times, followed by eight very thin coats of finish. They cost \nfrom $3,000 to $60,000, but endorsements from top musicians like Carlos Santana, and distribution \nthrough well-respected retailers like Rudy\u2019s Music Shop in Manhattan, have helped the brand establish \na foothold.30\nMuch like companies serving larger customer segments, nichers have three tasks: creating new \nmarkets, expanding current markets, and protecting their market position. The risk is that the niche \nmight dry up or be attacked. The company is then stuck with highly specialized resources that may \nnot have high-value alternative uses. Zippo has successfully addressed the problem of a fast-shrinking \nniche market.\nZippo  With smoking on a steady decline, Pennsylvania-based Zippo Manufacturing found \nthe market for its iconic brass and chrome \u201cwindproof\u201d cigarette lighters shrinking from 18 million \nunits sold in 1998 to 12 million in 2011. With the handwriting on the wall, the company decided \nto broaden its focus to selling \u201cflame,\u201d warmth, and much more, reducing its reliance on tobacco-\nrelated products to 50 percent of revenue by 2010. Although an earlier attempt to diversify into \ntape measures, key holders, and belt buckles in the 1960s and 1970s had lost momentum in \nthe 1990s and finally was discontinued in 2007, Zippo came close to meeting its new goal. It \nintroduced a long, slender multipurpose lighter for candles, grills, and fireplaces; launched an \nOutdoors Line including hand warmers and fire starters sold through DIC k\u2019S Sporting Goods, REI, \nand True value; and acquired W.R. Case & Sons Cutlery, a knife maker. Zippo even launched a \nclothing line and men\u2019s and women\u2019s fragrances as a way to become more of a lifestyle brand. \nThe company still sells its fair share of lighters by promoting new designs as well as perennial \nfavorites like lighters with Elvis Presley\u2019s image.31\nBecause niches can weaken, the firm must continually create new ones. The firm should \u201cstick to \nits niching,\u201d but not necessarily to its niche. That is why multiple niching can be preferable to single \nniching .

If Heinz can convince \nmore people to use ketchup, or to use ketchup with more meals, or to use more ketchup on each \noccasion, the firm will benefit considerably because it already sells almost two-thirds of the country\u2019s \nketchup.

Comprehensive solutions increase competitive strength and value to customers \nso that they feel appreciative or even privileged to be a customer, as opposed to feeling trapped or \ntaken advantage of.\nIn satisfying customer needs, we can distinguish among responsive marketing, anticipative \nmarketing, and creative marketing. A responsive  marketer finds a stated need and fills it. An anticipative  \nmarketer looks ahead to needs customers may have in the near future. A creative  marketer discovers \nsolutions that customers did not ask for but to which they enthusiastically respond. Creative market -\ners are proactive market-driving firms, not just market-driven ones.34 Many companies assume their \njob is simply to adapt to customer needs. They are reactive, largely because they are overly faithful to \nthe customer-orientation paradigm and fall victim to the \u201ctyranny of the served market.\u201d The most \nsuccessful companies instead proactively shape the market to their own offerings. Instead of simply \ntrying to be the best player, they change the rules of the game.35\nProactive companies create new offers to serve unmet\u2014and maybe even unknown\u2014consumer \nneeds. In the late 1970s Akio Morita, the Sony founder, was working on a pet project that would revo -\nlutionize the way people listened to music: a portable cassette player he called the Walkman. Engineers \nat the company insisted there was little demand for such a product, but Morita refused to part with \nhis vision. By the 20th anniversary of the Walkman, Sony had sold more than 250 million in nearly  \n100 different models.36\nEven when it does not launch offensives, a company must not leave its market position exposed. \nThe aim of a defensive marketing strategy is to reduce the probability of attack, divert attacks to less-\nthreatened areas, and lessen the intensity of attacks. A leader strives to do anything it legally and \nethically can to reduce competitors\u2019 ability to launch a new product, secure distribution, and gain \nconsumer awareness, trial, and repeat.37 In any strategy, speed of response can make an important \ndifference to profit.\nA dominant firm can use six main defense strategies.38 Decisions about which strategy to adopt \nwill depend in part on the company\u2019s resources and goals and on its expectations about how competi -\ntors will react.\n\u2022 Position defense.  Position defense means occupying the most desirable position in consum -\ners\u2019 minds, making the brand almost impregnable.

The market leader should erect outposts to protect a weak front or support a \npossible counterattack. Procter & Gamble brands such as Gain and Cheer laundry detergent and \nLuvs diapers have played strategic offensive and defensive roles in support of the Tide and Pampers \nbrands, respectively.\n\u2022 Preemptive defense.  A more aggressive maneuver is to attack first, perhaps with guerrilla action \nacross the market\u2014hitting one competitor here, another there\u2014and keeping everyone off bal -\nance. Another is to achieve broad market envelopment that signals competitors not to attack.39 \nYet another preemptive defense is to introduce a stream of new products and announce them \nin advance, signaling competitors that they will need to fight extra hard to gain market share. If \nMicrosoft announces development plans for a new product, smaller firms may concentrate their \ndevelopment efforts in other directions to avoid head-to-head competition. Some high-tech firms \nhave been accused of selling \u201cvaporware\u201d\u2014announcing products that miss delivery dates or are \nnever introduced.40\n\u2022 Counteroffensive defense.  In a counteroffensive, the market leader can meet the attacker fron -\ntally and hit its flank or launch a pincer movement so the attacker will have to pull back to defend \nitself. Another form of counteroffensive is the exercise of economic or political clout. The leader \nmay try to crush a competitor by subsidizing lower prices for a vulnerable product with revenue \nfrom its more profitable products, or it may prematurely announce a product upgrade to prevent \ncustomers from buying the competitor\u2019s product. Or the leader may lobby legislators to take \npolitical action to inhibit the competition or may initiate appropriate legal actions. Tech leaders \nlike Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Samsung have aggressively defended their brands \nin court.\n\u2022 Repositioning defense.  In a repositioning defense, the leader stretches its domain over new \nterritories through market broadening and market diversification. Market broadening  shifts the \ncompany\u2019s focus from the current product to the underlying generic need. Thus, \u201cpetroleum\u201d \ncompanies such as BP sought to recast themselves as \u201cenergy\u201d companies (e.g., \u201cBeyond Petro -\nleum\u201d). This change required them to research the oil, coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and chemical \nindustries. Market diversification  shifts the company\u2019s focus into unrelated industries.\n\u2022 Contraction defense.  Sometimes large companies can no longer defend all their territory. \nIn strategic withdrawal , they give up weaker markets and reassign resources to stronger ones. \nSara Lee sold off products that accounted for a large percentage of its revenues\u2014including its \nstrong Hanes hosiery brand and its global body care and European detergent businesses. It \nlater split its remaining products into two businesses. Hillshire Brands became the new name \nof the company, which focused on its core Hillshire Farms packaged meats business in North \nAmerica, and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 was a spin-off company for its successful European \ncoffee-and-tea business.41\nProcter & Gamble sold Pringles to Kellogg when it decided it wanted to get out of the food busi -\nness to focus on its core household and consumer products. Another company that restructured its \nbusiness to improve competitiveness was Kraft).\nKraft  After years of acquisitions, kraft split into two businesses: a fast-growing global snack \nand candy business that includes Oreo cookies and Cadbury candy and a slower-growing North \nAmerican grocery business with long-term stalwarts Maxwell House coffee, Planters peanuts, \nkraft cheese, and Jell-O. The rationale was to improve performance and give investors distinctly \ndifferent choices. The snack and candy business was branded as Mondel\u0113z International and \nwas positioned as a high-growth company with many opportunities in emerging markets such \nas China and India. Coined by two employees, the name Mondel\u0113z is a mash-up of the words \nfor \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d in Latin and several other Romance languages. The grocery business \nretained the kraft Foods name, and because it consisted of many category-dominant meat and \ncheese brands, it was seen as more of a cash cow for investors interested in consistent dividends. \nMondel\u0113z has ramped up for rapid expansion, while kraft Foods (now kraft Heinz) has focused on \ncost cutting and selective investment behind its power brands.42", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4687, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2f7ebf2-4eb1-4646-9fff-ba0876cb667e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2f7ebf2-4eb1-4646-9fff-ba0876cb667e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c14803ab-e814-4587-b6ee-25d507baf538", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "bf1ade9cc20ce82fa3ebee8dd168cc1958cec1f1dc3c7abfbb3fb41d0029bd36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bd2b57b-a0a6-4e91-b5a5-4abc99615f8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "cd4559781e90f0a6cc7937cacb37f2fe8e4cc8b344556743f09e4d8311224376", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efc2284c-e338-4249-bef1-0654e64dfb83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e12173111bc34591a12ec15be5dd8233ac63dd8c134e2ac57d86d9924ca324ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "384 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nProduct Life Cycle Marketing Strategies\nThe concept of product life cycle is one of the most influential theories on managing growth. The \ncore idea here is that products go through different stages over time, and that at each stage they face \ndifferent challenges and opportunities, requiring different marketing strategies and tactics. The key \nprinciples of the concept of a product life cycle, the specifics of each life cycle stage, and the alternative \nproduct life cycle patterns are discussed in the following sections.\nTHE CONCEPT OF A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE\nA company\u2019s positioning and differentiation strategy must change as its product, market, and com -\npetitors change over the product life cycle . The concept of product life cycle is based on four key \nassumptions:\n\u2022 Products have a limited life.\n\u2022 Product sales pass through distinct stages, each posing different challenges, opportunities, and \nproblems to the seller.\n\u2022 Profits rise and fall at different stages of the product life cycle.\n\u2022 Products require different marketing, financial, manufacturing, purchasing, and human resource \nstrategies in each life cycle stage.\nMost product life cycles are portrayed as bell-shaped curves of sales and profits, typically divided \ninto four stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline43 (see Figure 17.2). We can use the product \nlife cycle concept to analyze a product category (liquor), a product (vodka), or a brand (Absolut). Not \nall products go through all stages, and the length of each stage can vary substantially by product. For \nexample, a product might never leave the introduction stage (because it fails) or never complete the \ngrowth phase (because it never becomes profitable enough or grows to sufficient scale to be a truly \nmature product). In this context, the concept of product life cycle should be used to help managers \nthink about challenges at the different stages, and not necessarily about what to expect for the future \nof a given product.\n\u2022 Introduction.  A period of slow sales growth as the product is introduced in the market. Profits are \nnonexistent because of the heavy expenses of product introduction.\n\u2022 Growth.  A period of rapid market acceptance and substantial profit improvement.>> To improve \nperformance and \ncontinue to attract \ninvestors, kraft Foods \nsplit its bulging portfolio \nof brands in two, with \nMondel\u0113z International \npositioned as a fast-\ntrack global snack and \ncandy business and the \nslower-growing North \nAmerican arm retaining \nthe kraft Foods name \nfor its many category-\ndominant grocery \nbrands. \nSource: Michael Neelon(misc)/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2662, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efc2284c-e338-4249-bef1-0654e64dfb83": {"__data__": {"id_": "efc2284c-e338-4249-bef1-0654e64dfb83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d39b18c6-ba43-4205-b196-8f07068f2eec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "c353ae8e2493f16691229dcb51010fee84ff626b09496d04698b4ceb3d7bd33c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2f7ebf2-4eb1-4646-9fff-ba0876cb667e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "bf1ade9cc20ce82fa3ebee8dd168cc1958cec1f1dc3c7abfbb3fb41d0029bd36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11e2bbaa-7897-4879-8c09-f0aed76a223a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca40ea4af5689424ff4942d156bdcc870f0602fe6f89d34c91cec565efdacf22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 17    |  DRIvING GROWTH  IN COMPETITI vE MARkETS 385\n\u2022 Maturity.

Profits are nega -\ntive or low, and promotional expenditures are at their highest ratio to sales because of the need to  \n(1) inform potential consumers, (2) induce product trial, and (3) secure distribution in retail outlets.44 \nPrices tend to be higher because costs are high, and firms focus on buyers who are the most ready to \nbuy. Consider the challenges Zipcar faced in trying to establish itself in the hourly car rental market.\nZipcar  Car sharing started in Europe as a means to serve those who frequently used public \ntransportation but still needed a car a few times a month. In the United States, the appeal of \nZipcar, the market leader and pioneer in car sharing, has been both environmental and economic. \nWith a $50 membership fee and rates that total less than $100 a day\u2014including gas, insurance, \nand parking\u2014a typical family could save $3,000 to $4,000 a year by substituting Zipcar use for \ncar ownership. The firm estimated that every car it added kept up to 20 private cars off the road. \nTargeting major cities and college campuses, offering a wide variety of vehicles, and facing little \ncompetition, it grew about 30 percent annually for a number of years. Rental leader Hertz decided \nto enter the hourly car rental business in 2012, however, equipping its entire 375,000-vehicle \nU.S. fleet with devices that let customers use a computer or smart phone to reserve and unlock a \nrental car. Unlike Zipcar, Hertz offers one-way rentals and charges no membership or annual fees. \nWith Enterprise also entering the market at home, Zipcar set its sights overseas, concentrating \ninitially on the United kingdom and Spain. Needing resources to capitalize on global \nopportunities, it was acquired in 2013 by Avis Budget, the number-two rental car company.45\nGROWTH STAGE\nThe growth stage is marked by a rapid climb in sales. Early adopters like the product, and additional \nconsumers start buying it. New competitors enter, attracted by the opportunities. They introduce new \nproduct features and expand distribution. Prices stabilize or fall slightly, depending on how rapidly \ndemand increases.\nCompanies maintain marketing expenditures or raise them slightly to meet competition and con -\ntinue to educate the market. Sales rise much faster than marketing expenditures, causing a welcome \ndecline in the marketing-to-sales ratio. Profits increase as marketing costs are spread over a larger \nvolume, and unit manufacturing costs fall faster than price declines, owing to the producer-learning \neffect. Firms must watch for a change to a decelerating rate of growth in order to prepare new strategies.\nTo sustain rapid growth in market share now, a firm can adopt a variety of strategies: It can \nimprove product quality and add new features and improved styling; it can add new models and flanker \nproducts (e.g., different sizes and flavors) to protect the main product; it can enter new market seg -\nments; it can increase its distribution coverage and enter new distribution channels; it can shift from \nawareness and trial communication to preference and loyalty communication; and it can lower prices \nto attract the next layer of price-sensitive buyers.\nBy spending money on product improvement, promotion, and distribution, the firm can capture \na dominant position. In this case, a firm trades off maximum current profit for high market share and \nthe hope of even greater profits in the next stage. How much of the revenues the company decides to \nreinvest in future growth at this stage depends on its strategic goals and resources.\nSustaining a competitive advantage in the face of many possible marketplace changes can be \nchallenging, but it is not impossible, as evidenced by some of the long-time market leaders noted \npreviously. Finding new ways to consistently improve customer satisfaction can go a long way toward \nretaining competitive advantage.

In the second phase, sales per capita flatten because of market saturation. \nMost potential consumers have tried the product, and future sales depend on population growth and \nreplacement demand. In the third phase, decaying maturity, the absolute level of sales starts to decline, \nand customers begin switching to other products.\nThe third phase poses the most challenges. The sales slowdown creates overcapacity in the indus -\ntry, which intensifies competition. Weaker competitors withdraw. A few giants dominate\u2014perhaps \na quality leader, a service leader, and a cost leader\u2014and they profit mainly through high volume and \nlower costs. Surrounding them are a multitude of market nichers, including market specialists, product \nspecialists, and customizing firms.\nThe question is whether to struggle to become one of the big three and achieve profits through \nhigh volume and low cost or to pursue a niching strategy and profit through low volume and high \nmargins. Sometimes the market will divide into low- and high-end segments, and market shares of \nfirms in the middle will steadily erode. Here\u2019s how Swedish appliance manufacturer Electrolux has \ncoped with this situation:\nElectrolux AB  At the turn of this century, Swedish manufacturer Electrolux faced a rapidly \npolarizing appliance market. Low-cost Asian companies such as Haier, LG, and Samsung were \napplying downward price pressure, while premium competitors like Bosch, Sub-Zero, and viking \nwere growing at the expense of the middle-of-the-road brands. Electrolux\u2019s CEO at the time, \nHans Str\u00e5berg, decided to escape the middle by rethinking customers\u2019 wants and needs. He \nsegmented the market according to the lifestyle and purchasing patterns of about 20 different \ntypes of consumers to help target and position the company\u2019s broad portfolio of brands, which \nincludes Electrolux as well as Frigidaire refrigerators, AEG ovens, and Zanussi coffee machines. \nElectrolux now successfully markets its steam ovens to health-oriented consumers, for example, \nand its compact dishwashers, originally for smaller kitchens, to a broader consumer segment that \nwashes dishes more often. To companies stuck in the middle of a mature market, Str\u00e5berg offered \nthis advice: \u201cStart with consumers and understand what their latent needs are and what problems \nthey experience\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0then put the puzzle together yourself to discover what people really want to \nhave\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You need to figure out what people really want, although they can\u2019t express it.\u201d Electrolux \nis now concentrating on the top end of the appliance market, selling professional-grade ranges to \nthe ultra-luxury consumer segment. With distribution and local market presence in more than 150 \ncountries, the company aims to position itself for global growth, especially in emerging markets.47\n<< Squeezed by \ncompetitive pressure \nfrom both low-cost and \npremium competitors, \nElectrolux shed its \nmiddle-of-the-road \nimage by targeting \nits appliances to the \ndiffering lifestyle and \npurchasing patterns \nof some 20 types of \nconsumers.\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc82119f-9385-4f66-b108-f621eb95f039": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc82119f-9385-4f66-b108-f621eb95f039", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27be7fde-4ede-48b8-a0e8-5220823e6ced", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "ec17d5cd694d80134d5b5a9b5ad22bc1b14c92fa3d3e370ce576e5fa0c814c97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f31e8636-5c99-42bf-8ba5-f2b0d90b72bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap17.pdf"}, "hash": "7543338145473ac8e26f3b48d25f73d0cb827fa8f640d7cf9a99e912541c5a2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "842cff49-a3a7-4cd2-a4af-e8cfed65739e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ae8cba5a5dcdd9d66eee5826d6e11b35956f9fe158efc0f7f380df4f0020309", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "388 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nSome companies abandon weaker products to concentrate on new and more profitable ones. \nYet they may be ignoring the high potential that many mature markets and old products still have. \nIndustries widely thought to be mature\u2014autos, hotels, taxis, watches, cameras\u2014have been proved \notherwise by start-ups and established companies that disrupted traditional business models and found \nways to offer customers new value.\nTwo key ways to reverse the decline course for a company are market growth and product modi -\nfication. We discuss these two approaches next.\nMarket Growth.  A company might try to expand the market for its mature brand by maximizing \nthe two factors that make up sales volume: number of users and usage rate per user.\nA company can expand the number of users  through either or both of the following strategies:\n\u2022 Convert nonusers.  This approach is also referred to as primary demand stimulation . The key to the \ngrowth of air freight service was the constant search for new users to whom air carriers could \ndemonstrate the benefits of using air freight rather than ground transportation.\n\u2022 Attract competitors\u2019 customers.  This approach is often referred to as steal-share strategy . Marketers of \nPuffs facial tissues are always wooing Kleenex customers. When Goodyear decided to sell its tires \nat Walmart, Sears, and Discount Tire, it immediately boosted its market share by stealing share \nfrom competitors who had been selling tires in these retail outlets.\nA company can increase the usage rates among current users  through the following strategies:\n\u2022 Increase the number of usage occasions.  For example, Campbell\u2019s began promoting its soups for usage \nin the summer. Heinz might recommend using vinegar to clean windows.\n\u2022 Increase consumption on each occasion.  For example, Heinz designed larger, upside-down containers \nof ketchup to make it easier for users to squeeze out and use more ketchup.\n\u2022 Create new usage occasions.  For example, GlaxoSmithKline might promote Tums antacid as a \ncalcium supplement. Arm & Hammer might promote the use of baking soda as an odor remover \nfor refrigerators and kitchen sinks.\nProduct Modification.  Producers also try to stimulate sales by improving quality, features, \nor style. Quality improvement  increases functional performance through the launch of a \u201cnew and \nimproved\u201d product. Feature improvement  adds size, weight, materials, supplements, and accessories that \nexpand the product\u2019s performance, versatility, safety, or convenience. Style improvement  increases the \naesthetic appeal of the product.\nAny of these improvements can attract consumer attention. In the highly competitive digital \nphotography space, Shutterfly has grown annual revenue to over $1 billion by converting customers\u2019 \ndigital images into tangible items: photo books, calendars, greeting cards, wedding invitations, wall \ndecals, and more.\nThe paper industry is also coping with the challenges of the digital era. The industry recognizes \nthat as long as some consumers prefer to read, store, or share hard-copy documents, it must provide a \nsolution that is as environmentally sound as possible. Suppliers have worked to develop a more envi -\nronmentally friendly supply chain from seedlings and reforestation, as well as by adopting greener pulp \nand paper production, recycling, and reducing their carbon footprint. Such efforts are crucial for suc -\ncess and even survival. Due to the rise of e-mail, online bill payments, and other digital developments, \nleading envelope maker National Envelope went out of business after several years of dwindling sales, \nwhile leading postage meter supplier Pitney Bowes expanded its digital operations.\nDECLINE STAGE\nSales decline for a number of reasons, including technological advances, shifts in consumer tastes, and \nincreased domestic and foreign competition. All can lead to overcapacity, increased price cutting, and \nprofit erosion. The decline might be slow, as it was for sewing machines and newspapers, or rapid, as it \nwas for floppy disks and eight-track cartridges. Sales may plunge to zero or petrify at a low level. These \nstructural changes are different from a short-term decline resulting from a marketing crisis of some sort.\nAs sales and profits decline, some firms withdraw. Those remaining may reduce the number of \nproducts they offer, exiting smaller segments and weaker trade channels, cutting marketing budgets, \nand reducing prices further. Unless strong reasons for retention exist, carrying a weak product is often \nvery costly.

The company \nrebounded by focusing on the online educational market. Valuing the company\u2019s long-standing mis -\nsion to bring expert knowledge to the general public, more than half of U.S. students and teachers have \naccess to some Britannica content.48\nFaced with a declining market, many companies focus on harvesting or divesting themselves of \nstronger products and eliminating weak ones.\nHarvesting and Divesting.  Strategies for harvesting and for divesting are quite different. \nHarvesting  calls for gradually reducing the costs of a product or business while trying to maintain \nsales. The first step is to cut research and development costs and plant and equipment investment. \nThe company might also reduce product quality, sales force size, marginal services, and advertising \nexpenditures\u2014ideally without letting customers, competitors, and employees know what is happen -\ning. Harvesting is difficult to execute, yet many mature products warrant this strategy. And it can \nsubstantially increase current cash flow.49\nWhen a company decides on divesting  a product with strong distribution and residual goodwill, \nit can probably sell it to another firm. Some firms specialize in acquiring and revitalizing \u201corphan\u201d \nor \u201cghost\u201d brands that larger firms want to sell or that have encountered bankruptcy, such as Linens \n\u2019n Things, Folgers and Brim coffee, Nuprin pain reliever, and Salon Selectives shampoos. These firms \nattempt to capitalize on the residue of awareness in the market to develop a brand-revitalization strat -\negy. Reserve Brands bought Eagle Snacks in part because research showed that 6 of 10 adults remem -\nbered the brand, leading Reserve\u2019s CEO to observe, \u201cIt would take $300 million to $500 million to \nrecreate that brand awareness today.\u201d50\nIf the company cannot find any buyers, it must decide whether to liquidate the brand quickly \nor slowly. It must also decide how much inventory and service to maintain for past customers. For \nexample, when Harley-Davidson discontinued its Buell brand of sporty motorcycles, it continued to \nprovide support to current Buell owners.\nEliminating Weak Products.  Besides being unprofitable, weak products consume a dispro -\nportionate amount of management\u2019s time, require frequent price and inventory adjustments, incur \nexpensive setup for what are usually short production runs, draw advertising and sales force attention \nthat would be better used to make healthy products more profitable, and cast a negative shadow on \ncompany image. Maintaining them also delays the aggressive search for replacement products, creating \na lopsided product mix long on yesterday\u2019s breadwinners and short on tomorrow\u2019s.\nRecognizing these drawbacks, General Motors decided to drop the floundering Saturn, Oldsmo -\nbile, Pontiac, and Hummer lines. Discontinuing established brands is always a difficult decision, \nbecause the company is essentially writing off years and often decades of brand-building efforts. There -\nfore, the decision to eliminate underperforming products must not be taken lightly and involves both \nshort-term and long-term implications for the company.\nUnfortunately, most companies have not developed a policy for handling aging products. The first \ntask is to establish a system for identifying them. Many companies appoint a product-review commit -\ntee with representatives from marketing, research and development, manufacturing, and finance that \nconsiders all available information and makes a recommendation for each product\u2014leave it alone, \nmodify its marketing strategy, or drop it.51\nSome firms abandon declining markets earlier than others do. Much depends on the height of exit \nbarriers in the industry. The lower the barriers, the easier it is for firms to leave the industry, and the \nmore tempting it is for the remaining firms to stay and attract the withdrawing firms\u2019 customers. Procter \n& Gamble stayed in the declining liquid-soap business and improved its profits as others withdrew.\nThe appropriate strategy also depends on the industry\u2019s relative attractiveness and the compa -\nny\u2019s competitive strength in it. A company in an unattractive industry that possesses competitive \nstrength should consider shrinking selectively. A company in an attractive industry that has com -\npetitive strength should consider strengthening its investment. Companies that successfully restage \nor rejuvenate a mature product often do so by adding value to it.\nALTERNATIVE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE PATTERNS\nThe product life cycle theory has its share of critics, who claim that life cycle patterns are too variable \nin shape and duration to be generalized and that marketers can seldom tell what stage their product \nis in.

Figure 17.3(a) shows a growth\u2013slump\u2013maturity pattern , which is char -\nacteristic of small kitchen appliances like bread makers and toaster ovens. Sales grow rapidly when \nthe product is first introduced and then fall to a \u201cpetrified\u201d level sustained by late adopters buying the \nproduct for the first time and early adopters replacing it. The cycle\u2013recycle pattern  in Figure 17.3(b) often \ndescribes the sales of new drugs. The pharmaceutical company aggressively promotes its new drug, \nproducing the first cycle. Later, sales start declining, and another promotion push produces a second \ncycle (usually of smaller magnitude and duration). Another common product life cycle pattern is the \nscalloped pattern  shown in Figure 17.3(c). Here, sales pass through a succession of life cycles reflecting \nthe discovery of new product characteristics, uses, or users. Sales of nylon showed a classic scalloped \npattern because of the many new uses\u2014parachutes, hosiery, shirts, carpeting, boat \nsails, and automobile tires\u2014discovered over time.54\nThere are two special categories of product life cycles: fads and trends.FIGURE 17.3 \nCommon Product Life Cycle Patterns\n(a) Growth-Slump-Maturity Pattern (b) Cycle-Recycle Pattern (c) Scalloped PatternSales Volume\nSales Volume\nSales Volume\nTime Time TimePrimary\ncycleRecyc le\n>> Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are \none of the later innovations in the \n evolution of the paper towel market.\nSource: The Photo Works/Alamy Stock Photo\u2022 A fad is \u201cunpredictable, short-lived, and without social, economic, and political \nsignificance.\u201d A company can cash in on a fad such as Crocs clogs, Elmo TMX \ndolls, and Pok\u00e9mon gifts and toys, but getting it right requires luck and good tim -\ning. Fads come quickly into public view, are adopted with great zeal, peak early, \nand decline very fast. Their acceptance cycle is short, and they tend to attract only \na limited following searching for excitement or wanting to distinguish themselves \nfrom others. It is important to note that sometimes it is hard to tell whether a \nproduct is a fad or not. For example, GoPro cameras have been frequently referred \nto as a fad, but they have stuck around.\n\u2022 A trend  is a direction or sequence of events with momentum and durability. \nTrends are more predictable and durable than fads; they reveal the shape of the \nfuture and can provide strategic direction.

Consider the evolution of the paper towel \nmarket . Homemakers originally used cotton and linen dishcloths and towels in their \nkitchens. Then a paper company looking for new markets developed paper towels, \ncrystallizing a latent market that other manufacturers entered. The number of brands \ngrew and created market fragmentation.

Competitors produced their own versions of absorbent paper towels, and the market fragmented \nagain. One manufacturer introduced a \u201csuperstrength\u201d towel that was soon copied. Another intro -\nduced a \u201clint-free\u201d towel, subsequently copied. A later innovation was wipes containing a cleaning \nagent (like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes) that are often surface-specific (for wood, metal, or stone). Thus, \ndriven by innovation and competition, paper towels evolved from a single product to one with various \nabsorbencies, strengths, and applications.\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\nis particularly attractive to a challenger with fewer \nresources, and it can be more likely to succeed than \nfrontal attacks. Top communication companies such \nas verizon and AT&T found themselves losing sales in \nthe specialized but fast-growing prepaid smart-phone \nmarket when smaller carriers such as Boost Mobile, \nvirgin Mobile, and MetroPCS offered lower prices \nand greater selection. Another flanking strategy is \nto serve uncovered market needs. Mounting a geo-\ngraphic attack, the challenger targets areas where the \nopponent is underperforming.\n\u2022 Encirclement attack.  Encirclement attempts to \ncapture a wide slice of territory by launching a grand \noffensive on several fronts. This makes sense when \nthe challenger commands superior resources. Back \nwhen it was engaged in a heated battle with much \nbigger rival Microsoft, Sun Microsystems licensed \nits Java software to hundreds of companies and \nthousands of software developers for all sorts of \nconsumer devices. As consumer electronics began to \ngo digital, Java started appearing in a wide range of \ngadgets.\n\u2022 Bypass attack.  Bypassing the enemy altogether to \nattack easier markets offers three lines of approach: \ndiversifying into unrelated products, diversifying into \nnew geographic markets, and leapfrogging into new \ntechnologies. During the \u201ccola wars,\u201d Pepsi used a \nbypass strategy against Coke by rolling out Aquafina \nbottled water nationally before Coke launched its \nDasani brand, purchasing orange juice giant Tropi-\ncana, and purchasing the Quaker Oats Company, \nowner of market leader Gatorade sports drink.\n\u2022 Guerrilla attack.  A guerrilla attack  consists of small, \nintermittent attacks, conventional and unconven-\ntional, including selective price cuts, intense promo-\ntional blitzes, and occasional legal action to harass \nthe opponent and eventually secure permanent foot-\nholds. A guerrilla campaign can be expensive, though \nless so than a frontal, encirclement, or flank attack, \nbut it typically must be backed by a stronger attack \nto beat the opponent.Many market challengers have gained ground or even \novertaken the leader. Challengers set high aspirations, \nwhile market leaders can fall prey to conducting business \nas usual. Yet not all challengers succeed in their quest to \ngain market position.\nTo increase its chances for success, a market chal-\nlenger must first define its strategic objective, which is \nusually to increase market share. It then must decide \nwhom to attack. One option is to attack the market leader. \nThis is a high-risk but potentially high-payoff strategy and \nmakes good sense if the leader is not serving the market \nwell. Alternatively, a challenger can attack firms its own \nsize that are underperforming and underfinanced. These \nfirms have obsolete products, charge excessive prices, or \nfail to satisfy customers in other ways. A challenger can \nalso attack small local and regional firms. For example, \nmany major banks grew to their present size by gobbling \nup smaller regional banks. Finally, a challenger might not \nattack a specific firm so much as disrupt an entire industry \nthat doesn\u2019t adequately address customer needs. Firms \nlike Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb have succeeded by dis-\nrupting their entire industries.\nGiven clear opponents and objectives, a challenger \nmight adopt different strategies to achieve its goals.

Once successful, a challenger brand \nmust retain a challenger mentality even if it becomes a \nmarket leader, always highlighting the way it does things \ndifferently.57Any aspect of the marketing program can serve as the \nbasis for attack, including lower-priced or discounted \nproducts, new or improved products and services, \na wider variety of offerings, and innovative distribu -\ntion strategies. A challenger\u2019s success depends on \nparticular defensive strategy chosen depends on the \nneeds of the company\u2019s target customers, the company\u2019s \nresources and goals, and its expectations about how \ncompetitors will react.\n6. Products go through different stages over time, and at \neach stage they face different challenges and opportu -\nnities that require different marketing strategies and \ntactics. The four distinct stages of the product life cycle \nare introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Most \nproducts today are in the maturity stage.\n7. The introduction stage is marked by slow growth and \nminimal profits. If successful, the product enters a \ngrowth stage marked by rapid sales growth and increas -\ning profits. In the maturity stage, sales growth slows \nand profits stabilize. Finally, the product enters a decline \nstage. The company\u2019s task is then to identify truly weak \nproducts and phase them out with minimal impact on \ncompany profits, employees, and customers.\n8. Not all products exhibit a bell-shaped product life cycle \npattern. To gain and defend their market position, firms \nneed to visualize a market\u2019s evolutionary path and \nthe way it is likely to be influenced by new customer \nneeds, competitors, technology, channels, and other \ndevelopments.summary\n1. Assessing growth opportunities involves two main \nconsiderations: identifying the types of products and \nmarkets a company should focus on and managing the \nproduct\u2013market growth strategy over time.\n2. Market growth can be achieved by four core strategies \nthat define market opportunities for a firm in terms \nof current and new products and markets. A firm can \npursue one or more of the four product\u2013market growth \nstrategies: market penetration , market development, \nproduct development, and diversification .\n3. A company can grow in two ways: by increasing out -\nput and enhancing revenues and profits internally\u2014an \napproach commonly referred to as organic growth\u2014or by \nrelying on mergers and acquisitions. Market-penetration \nand market-development strategies typically follow the \npath of organic growth, whereas product development \nand diversification can involve organic growth as well as \ngrowth by mergers and acquisitions.\n4. Firms with low shares of the total market can become \nhighly profitable by targeting small markets of little or no \ninterest to the larger firms. Targeting niche markets enables \nfirms to know their target customers and meet their needs \nbetter than other firms by offering superior value.\n5. While trying to expand total market size, a firm must \nalso actively defend its current market position.

Soon after, three guests booked \na stay at their apartment for $80. The success from this one \nnight inspired the pair to unite with an old roommate, Nathan \nBlecharzyk, and build the idea into a business.\nIn its first year, Airbnb targeted conferences with atten-\ndance higher than the number of available nearby hotel \nrooms. Starting with the 2008 South by Southwest confer -\nence in Austin, Texas, Airbnb attempted to arouse interest \nby getting coverage from online blogs. Chesky used this \nconference to test and improve his product. Initially, Airbnb \nmodeled itself as a listing site, akin to Craigslist, rather than \nan online marketplace. The hosts of the location that Chesky \nbooked offered to pick him up at the airport and prepared a \ndinner for him. Chesky realized the model wasn\u2019t ideal later \nwhen the hosts awkwardly asked when he would pay them \nfor the stay. From that point on, the Airbnb website became \nthe means of payment for the renter; the company would \ntake a small commission fee. In addition, customers told \nAirbnb that they would be interested in general listings of \navailability even when there weren\u2019t any events happening. \nConsequently, Airbnb allowed hosts to list their properties at \nany time.\nWith the guidance of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator, \nAirbnb took its offering to New York City in 2009. New York \nCity was an ideal place for the company to start because of \nthe high prices of hotels. Airbnb started with a small group of \nrepeat renters and hosts. The founders made frequent trips to \nthe city to receive feedback on the system. Using this feed-\nback, Airbnb began to invest its resources in building aware-\nness of its product. For example, Airbnb saw that many hosts \nused cellphone cameras to post basic pictures of their prop-\nerties on the website. In response, Airbnb rented a profes-\nsional-quality camera and took high-definition photographs \nof the properties to paint them in a good light. Airbnb learned \nthat professional displays of locations would increase the \nodds of their being rented by a factor of more than 3. Airbnb \nalso encouraged its hosts and renters to post their experi-\nences on social media, fostering a network between the \ngrowing number of hosts and guests. Soon after, the number \nof renters and hosts dramatically grew in New York City, and \nAirbnb began to expand to major cities across the globe.\nAirbnb\u2019s rapid success helped it attract venture capital. \nFollowing the initial $20,000 investment from Y Combinator \nin 2009, later that year Airbnb raised $600,000 in financing \nfrom Sequoia Capital to continue expanding operations both \ndomestically and globally. One year later, Airbnb raised an \nadditional $7.2 million in venture capital from Greylock Part-\nners. The next year, Airbnb raised $112 million from Andrees-\nsen Horowitz and reached a $1 billion valuation. Fueled by \nventure capital, Airbnb was available in 89 countries and \nreached over one million nights booked less than three years \nafter launch.\nAs Airbnb quickly grew, the company found itself facing \nrapidly intensifying competition. Specifically, it faced three main types of competitors. The first was imitator websites. \nAfter Airbnb\u2019s initial success, over 500 imitator websites, \nsuch as Wimdu and Airizu, attempted to mimic the compa-\nny\u2019s services and sell their websites to investors. The second \ntype of competitor was vacation rentals. American compa-\nnies such as HomeAway, vRBO ( vacation Rentals by Owner), \nand Flip key offered paid vacation rental homes that targeted \nfamilies with more upscale accommodations. The third \ncompetitor was hotel websites such as Travelocity, Hotels.\ncom, and Booking.com, which provided customers with easy \naccess to smaller hotels as well as discounted room inven-\ntory from larger hotels.\nDespite the growing competition, Airbnb managed to \ncontinue its rapid growth.

John Hayes, chief marketing \nofficer for American Express, explained the rationale behind \ndeveloping a separate small business brand, \u201cSmall business \nowners are fundamentally different from people who work for \nlarge companies. They\u2019re characterized by a shared mindset; \nthey live and breathe the business they\u2019re in. We think it\u2019s \nimportant for this area to have its own identity.\u201d\nAt the turn of the century, American Express introduced \ntwo revolutionary new credit cards, Blue and Centurion \nBlack. Blue contained a chip that enhanced internet secu -\nrity and targeted younger, tech-savvy consumers with a \nhip image and no annual fee. The Black Card, on the other \nhand, targeted the most elite clients, who spent more than \n$150,000 annually and desired amenities such as 24-hour \npersonal concierge service and invitations to exclusive \nevents. The company also expanded its Membership \nRewards program, which at the time was the world\u2019s largest \ncard-based rewards program. Cardholders could redeem \npoints for travel, entertainment, gift certificates, and other \npredetermined offerings.\nIn response, visa and MasterCard turned on the com-\npetitive pressure. visa took ownership of the trending con-\nsumer check cards, which were debit cards that subtracted \nmoney for purchases directly from a cardholder\u2019s bank \naccount. MasterCard surged in popularity as well when it cre-\nated the \u201cPriceless\u201d ad campaign, which became a ubiqui-\ntous pop culture reference point.

American Express began as a \n19th-century express shipping company, grew into a travel \nservices company, and eventually evolved into a global \npayments company associated with strong brand images: \nprestige, trust, security, customer service, international \nacceptability, and integrity.\nAmerican Express created the first internationally \naccepted \u201cTravelers Cheque\u201d in 1891, which used the same \nsignature security system and exchange-rate guarantees \nemployed today. In 1958, American Express issued its first \ncharge card\u2014a card that requires customers to pay off out-\nstanding balances, unlike the revolving debt possible with \ncredit cards. American Express charged a higher annual fee \nthan its competitors in order to create the feeling of prestige \nand foster a sense of membership. By 1967, one-third of the \ncompany\u2019s total profit came from its charge card businesses, \nand the American Express card surpassed the Travelers \nCheque to become the company\u2019s most visible symbol.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, American Express stepped \nup its marketing efforts in response to strong competitive \npressure from Master Charge (now MasterCard) and Bank -\nAmericard (later to become visa).

The familiar blue-box \nlogo first appeared in 1974 with the words American Express  \nprinted in white.\nMany perceived American Express cards as a status \nsymbol signifying success and achievement.

Over the next three years, \nAmerican Express partnered with banks such as MBNA, Citi-\ngroup, UBS, and USAA. It also launched a handful of strong \nmarketing campaigns and taglines throughout the 2000s to \nhelp increase membership. The \u201cMy Life. My Card\u201d campaign \nfeatured celebrities like Robert De Niro, Ellen DeGeneres, and \nTiger Woods, and the \u201cAre you a Cardmember?\u201d campaign \nacted as a call to action to join American Express.\nThings took a turn for the worse when the global econ-\nomy collapsed in 2008 and significantly impacted American \nExpress\u2019s financial results. In order to fuel growth, American \nExpress had deviated from its core strategy of targeting \naffluent, low-risk consumers and instead had focused on \nincreasing membership regardless of qualifications. These \nnew cardholders were allowed to carry over a balance and \npay only the interest, a policy that eventually resulting in \nincreased default payments, weaker billings, and higher \ncredit losses. As the world slowly recovered from the eco-\nnomic crisis, American Express bounced back more quickly \nthan most credit card and financial services companies. It \nwent back to focusing on an affluent customer base and \nclosed many of its bad accounts. The company pushed more \ncards that carried an annual fee, broadened its marketing \nfocus to bring in new affluent customers, and wooed small \nbusinesses with ramped-up rewards and new technological \ninnovations.\nAs a new generation of consumers enter the market, \nAmerican Express faces the challenge of staying relevant. \nHistorically, the success of American Express has been \nlargely due to its customer service. Representatives can \nhelp customers book travel, recommend the best res -\ntaurants, and book tickets for shows and sports events. \nHowever, with the advancement of technology and spe -\ncialized apps, fewer and fewer customers call upon these \nservices. Moreover, most Millennials\u2014who are the next wave of credit card customers\u2014are not interested in travel \nassistance and concierge services: They use kayak, Airbnb, \nTripAdvisor, and OpenTable. In addition, competing financial \ncompanies, most notably Chase and Citibank, have offered \ncredit cards custom-tailored to the rapidly growing Millen -\nnial demographic. To address these challenges, American \nExpress has increased sign-up bonuses, augmented spend -\ning rewards, and offered perks such as Uber credit that are \nsquarely aimed at Millennials. It is also redesigning many \nof its cards to look sleeker, aiming to appeal to Millenni -\nals\u2019 desire to express their personality rather than wealth \nand\u00a0status.\nIn fending off rapidly growing competition, American \nExpress has an important advantage\u2014the strong brand that \nthe company has developed and nurtured over the years. \nBloomberg Businessweek  and Interbrand rank American \nExpress in the top 25 \u201cMost valuable Brands in the World\u201d \nyear after year, Fortune  ranks American Express as one of the \ntop \u201cMost Admired Companies,\u201d and J.D. Powers frequently \nranks American Express as the top U.S. credit card company. \nThese results are a testament not only to the company\u2019s \nongoing innovation in product development and marketing, \nbut also to its commitment to providing customers with out-\nstanding service anywhere in the world.59\nQuestions\n1.
