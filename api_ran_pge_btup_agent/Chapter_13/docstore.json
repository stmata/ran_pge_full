of hip-hop group \nN.W.A. and had made an indelible mark on the music scene before becoming an entrepreneur. \nHis Beats by Dre headphones, launched in 2006 with music mogul Jimmy Iovine, have become \na must for many music lovers despite costing $300, nearly 10 times what ordinary earbuds sell \nfor. Their appeal is in the thumping, bass-heavy sound and sleek look, even if the reviews among \naudiophiles are somewhat mixed. With strong adoption among celebrity musicians and athletes, As the communication landscape becomes ever more complex, companies are faced with the \ngrowing challenge of coordinating communication activities to ensure that they deliver a consis -\ntent message across different channels\u2014and do so in a way that enables them to achieve their strategic \ngoals. As a result, companies are adopting integrated marketing communications as an approach to \ndesigning, communicating, and delivering a message through multiple strategies that work together \nand reinforce one another. One company that has successfully used diverse means of disseminating \nits message is Beats by Dr. Dre.Designing an Integrated Marketing \nCampaign in the Digital Age13\nProduct place-\nment in music \nvideos, celebrity \nendorsements \nfrom top artists, \nand partnering \nwith companies \nlike Chrysler, HP, \nand HTC to incor -\nporate its sound \ntechnology in their \nproducts were key \ncomponents in the \nsuccess of Beats \nby Dre.  \nSource: Akio Kon/  \nBloomberg/Getty Images", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc284aa4-29ef-4944-b53b-b58b26159e3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc284aa4-29ef-4944-b53b-b58b26159e3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d39df58-e9d0-41d6-867b-47cb1eb53d93", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "0a8ae37f774f68c8131ca434d02d9941e6ad8bae75e6ec60a9e7ee7162faa4d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "996e7322-a309-46c9-95f0-250e6dd8b5f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "a107df045d8154e8a8c19e12704929886982093f7c13b41ef327e1a4f0eb7556", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea5006d3-849b-45ce-b91e-0318af37a1cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7a14e85f0cc9d583ba255f3b74a2ad2f0293c3c1d79806d42cc152e4de154c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "283\nPART 5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\n13.1  Describe the key principles in managing an \nintegrated marketing campaign.\n13.2  Define the key aspects of managing an effective \nadvertising campaign.\n13.3  Explain how to design and manage online \ncommunications.\n13.4  Describe the key aspects of managing social \nmedia.\n13.5  Explain how to manage mobile \ncommunications.13.6  Explain how to design meaningful events and \nexperiences.\n13.7  Describe the role of word of mouth in marketing \ncommunications.\n13.8  Summarize how to manage publicity and public \nrelations.\n13.9  Discuss the role of product packaging as a \ncommunication tool.Beats became as fashionable as they were practical and an essential modern lifestyle item. Product \nplacement, celebrity endorsements, and joint (co-op) advertising were key components of Beats\u2019s \nmarketing strategy. Dre and Iovine, who at the time was the chairman of Interscope Records, had \nrelationships with most of the top musicians and were able to arrange for Beats headphones to \nappear in music videos of some of the best-selling music artists, such as Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, \nSnoop Dogg, and Nicki Minaj. The endorsement by Dr. Dre brought Beats credibility among artists \nwho might  otherwise have been unwilling to endorse a commercial product. The exclusivity and \nthe high cost associated with creating music videos also helped make Beats a status symbol and \nmoved them closer to becoming a cultural phenomenon. Dre and Iovine\u2019s expertise and connections \nin the industry enabled them to identify hit songs and ensure placement for Beats headphones in \nthe music video. In addition to celebrity endorsements, Beats developed celebrity special editions: \npurple JustBeats with Justin Bieber, jewelry-like HeartBeats with Lady Gaga, and DiddyBeats with \nP .\u00a0Diddy. Beats also partnered with firms like Chrysler, HP , and HTC to build its sound technology into \ntheir cars, computers, and smartphones, and it has introduced its own version of earbuds and other \n products. \u201cWe sold half a billion worth of product before we paid for one ad, \u201d commented Iovine. \nBeats\u2019s success did not remain unnoticed by the large industry players.

IMC ensures that a com -\npany\u2019s communication activities are consistent with one another and can achieve the company\u2019s \ncommunication goals in an effective and cost-efficient manner. IMC can occur on four distinct levels: \nhorizontal, vertical, internal, and external.\n\u2022 Horizontal integration  involves coordinating all relevant marketing actions\u2014including  packaging, \npricing, sales promotions, and distribution\u2014with the communication campaign to achieve \n maximum customer impact.\n\u2022 Vertical integration  involves aligning the communication objectives with the higher-level goals that \nguide the company\u2019s overarching marketing strategy.\n\u2022 Internal integration  involves sharing the relevant information from different departments\u2014  \n including product development, market research, sales, and customer service\u2014with the \n communication team to create an effective and cost-efficient campaign.\n\u2022 External integration  coordinates a company\u2019s communication activities with those of the  external \ncollaborators\u2014including advertising, social media, and public relations agencies; event  organizers; \nand campaign co-sponsors.\nHaving a well-integrated communication campaign is crucial to the company\u2019s market success.2 \nIndeed, without an explicit focus on consistency, a company\u2019s communication can easily become a \nrandom compilation of unrelated (and sometimes even conflicting) messages, designed by different \ncreative teams working in isolation from one another, and distributed though disparate media channels \nin a way that fails to emphasize their joint impact and might ultimately confuse rather than inform \nand persuade target customers.\nThe wide range of communication tools, messages, and audiences available to marketers makes \nit imperative that companies move toward integrated marketing communications. They must adopt \na 360-degree view of consumers to fully understand all the different ways that communications can \naffect behavior. When done well, integrated marketing communications evaluate the strategic roles of \na variety of communication disciplines and combine them seamlessly to provide clarity, consistency, \nand maximum impact of messages.\nIn developing an integrated marketing communications program, the marketer\u2019s overriding goal \nis to create the most effective and efficient communication program possible. The following criteria \ncan help ensure that communications are truly integrated.3\n\u2022 Coverage.  Coverage is the proportion of the audience reached by each communication option \nemployed, as well as the amount of overlap among those options. In other words, to what extent \ndo different communication options reach the designated target market and the same or different \nconsumers making up that market?\n\u2022 Contribution.  Contribution is the inherent ability of a marketing communication to elicit the desired \nresponse from consumers, and to exert communication effects on them, in the absence of expo -\nsure to any other communication option. How much does a communication affect consumer \nprocessing and build awareness, enhance image, elicit responses, and induce sales?\n\u2022 Commonality.  Commonality is the extent to which common  associations are reinforced across com -\nmunication options\u2014that is, the extent to which different communication options share the same \nmeaning. The consistency and cohesiveness of the brand image are important because they deter -\nmine how easily existing associations and responses can be recalled and how easily additional \nassociations and responses can become linked to the brand in memory.\n\u2022 Complementarity.  Communication options are often more effective when used in tandem. \n Complementarity involves emphasizing different  associations and linkages across communication \noptions. For effective positioning, brands typically need to establish multiple brand associations. \nDifferent marketing communication options may be better suited to establishing a particular \nbrand association. For example, sponsorship of a cause may improve perceptions of a brand\u2019s \ntrust and credibility, but TV and print advertising may be needed to communicate its perfor -\nmance advantages.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b52983ef-a955-452e-abc4-dfa5a52ac4f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b52983ef-a955-452e-abc4-dfa5a52ac4f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9db27212-f26f-4a7f-a4bc-9ce903da5831", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "dbb2cc19d6857f46eae2bd273e67a68140556747058f886daf5a90c81cb19a41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea5006d3-849b-45ce-b91e-0318af37a1cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "9fcf03bae7c3f05c4cd0773d1b55b19dc8be410162122205f70690fd45794a7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "93ee9006-598d-41f1-931c-60b7b732f8a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "380ce6680bf9cabf6ab1d47b3d508d143bd670d741f10862c4597a9c809e8fd9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 13    |  DESIGNING  AN INTEG rATED  MArKETING  CAMPAIGN  IN THE DIGITAL  AGE 285\n\u2022 Conformability.

Typically, the advertiser purchases media time (in the case \nof television and radio advertising) or space (in the case of print advertising) in order to convey the \ncompany\u2019s message to its target audience. The most popular forms of advertising\u2014television, print, \nradio, online, and place advertising\u2014are discussed in more detail in the following sections.\nTELEVISION ADVERTISING\nTelevision is generally acknowledged as the most powerful advertising medium and reaches a broad \nspectrum of consumers. TV advertising has three particularly important strengths. First, it can vividly \ndemonstrate product attributes and persuasively explain their corresponding consumer benefits. \nSecond, it can dramatically portray user and usage imagery, brand personality, and other intangibles. \nThird, television has the opportunity to tap a captive audience during live programming at important \nevents (e.g., the Super Bowl, Oscars, and unfolding news stories).\nAflac  Aflac (which stands for American Family Life Assurance Company), the largest supplier \nof supplemental insurance, was relatively unknown until a highly creative ad campaign made it one  \nof the most widely recognized brands in recent history. Created by the Kaplan Thaler ad agency, \nthe lighthearted campaign features an irascible duck incessantly squawking the company\u2019s \nacronymous name, \u201cAflac!\u201d while consumers or celebrities discuss its products. The duck\u2019s \nfrustrated bid for attention appealed to consumers. Sales were up 28 percent in the first year  \nthe duck aired, and name recognition went from 13 percent to 91 percent. Aflac has stuck with the \nduck in its advertising, even incorporating it into its corporate logo in 2005. Social media have \nenabled marketers to further develop the duck\u2019s personality: It has 515,000 Facebook fans and \ncounting. The Aflac duck is not just a U.S. phenomenon. It also stars in Japanese TV ads\u2014with \na somewhat brighter disposition\u2014where it has been credited with helping drive sales in Aflac\u2019s \nbiggest market.5\nBecause of the fleeting nature of commercials, however, and the distracting creative elements often \nfound in them, product-related messages and the brand itself can be overlooked.6 Furthermore, the \nhigh volume of competitive advertisements and other nonprogramming material on television creates \nclutter that makes it easy for consumers to ignore or forget ads.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4411, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93ee9006-598d-41f1-931c-60b7b732f8a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "93ee9006-598d-41f1-931c-60b7b732f8a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "883a700c-f45e-4c30-8048-1e0e77127f79", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "a16f78fb0baa0bcd2edf19a7625b5ed2193a9add85745a49087a1325bb6d11b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b52983ef-a955-452e-abc4-dfa5a52ac4f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "a80453832a1e50604f8da20ee0f8cc1517c689c29fb30b64e9d5f12f7db8132c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3402338b-1fe0-4d29-be6c-c91d1b25c9f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63c99622763d76f691b85f27219f50cbdf82e33203113c50df5ae98ec561ac89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "286 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nAnother consideration is the relatively high cost of television advertising. A commercial during a \npopular show on a national network might cost $200,000 to $500,000 per 30-second spot and deliver \n2 to 7 million viewers. That equates to 8 to 10 cents or more per viewer. In contrast, online ads with \nvideo can cost around $25 per 1000 impressions, which is equal to 2.5 cents per viewer, although their \nimpact may be diminished because they are often viewed on a much smaller computer or mobile \ndevice screen.7\nWith the advancement of online streaming, television programming has expanded beyond the \nactual television screen to include streaming to computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. This \nshift has given consumers greater control over when and how to view a company\u2019s communications. \nIn addition, the growing popularity of alternative commercial-free entertainment programming, such \nas Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, is changing the communication landscape traditionally dominated by \n30-second television ads. In response, marketers are seeking novel ways to engage viewers across \nthe various types of programming and across different devices on which customers view television \nadvertising.\nDespite its drawbacks, television advertising can be a powerful way to inform customers about the \ncompany and its offerings, strengthen customer preferences and brand loyalty, and generate sales and \nprofits. Savvy marketers take advantages of the benefits of television advertising and use it in combina -\ntion with other forms of advertising and marketing communication to maximize its customer impact.\nPRINT ADVERTISING\nPrint media offer a stark contrast to broadcast media. Because readers consume them at their own \npace, magazines and newspapers can provide detailed product information and effectively commu -\nnicate user and usage imagery. At the same time, the static nature of the visual images in print media \nmakes dynamic presentations or demonstrations difficult, and print media can be fairly passive.\nThe two main print media\u2014magazines and newspapers\u2014share many advantages and disadvan -\ntages. Although newspapers are timely and pervasive, magazines are typically more effective at \n building user and usage imagery. Newspapers are popular for local\u2014especially retailer\u2014advertising. \nOn an average day, roughly one-half to three-quarters of U.S. adults read a newspaper, although they \nare increasingly doing so online. Print advertising has steadily declined in recent years.8 Advertisers \nhave some flexibility in designing and placing newspaper ads, but relatively poor reproduction quality \nand short \u201cshelf life\u201d can diminish the impact.\nResearchers report that the picture, headline,  and copy  in print ads matter, in that order of importance. \nThe picture must draw attention.

The copy must be engaging and the brand\u2019s name prominent. Even then, less than 50\u00a0  percent \nof the exposed audience will notice even a really outstanding ad. About 30 percent might recall the \nheadline\u2019s main point, some 25 percent register the advertiser\u2019s name, and fewer than 10\u00a0  percent read \nmost of the body copy. Ordinary ads don\u2019t achieve even these modest results.\nA print ad should be clear, consistent, and well branded.

Much radio listen -\ning occurs in the car and out of the home. To be successful, radio networks are going multiplatform \nwith a strong digital presence to allow listeners to tune in anytime, anywhere.\nPerhaps radio\u2019s main advantage is flexibility: Stations are very targeted, ads are relatively inexpen -\nsive to produce and place, and short closings for scheduling them allow for quick response. Radio can \nengage listeners through a combination of popular brands, local presence, and strong personalities. It \nis a particularly effective medium in the morning; it can also let companies achieve a balance between \nbroad and localized market coverage. In addition, radio advertising is benefiting from the growing \npopularity of podcasts, which provide listeners with a wide array of options to choose from and the \nability to choose when to listen to the desired content.\nRadio\u2019s obvious disadvantages are its lack of visual images and the relatively passive nature of \nthe consumer processing that results. Nevertheless, radio ads can be extremely creative. Clever use of \nmusic, sound, and other creative devices can tap into the listener\u2019s imagination to create powerfully \nrelevant images.\nONLINE ADVERTISING\nGiven that internet users spend only a small portion of their time online actually searching for infor -\nmation, display ads still hold great promise compared to popular search ads. But ads need to be more \nattention-getting and influential, better targeted, and more closely tracked.9\nOnline ads offer several advantages.

Online advertising also has the advantage of contextual placement , which means \nmarketers can buy ads on sites related to their own offerings. They can also place advertising based on \nkeywords that customers type into search engines to reach people when they\u2019ve actually started the \nbuying process.11 Furthermore, online advertising allows for a plethora of content types\u2014from text-\nonly ads to print-style advertisements, video commercials, and fully interactive experiences.\nGoing online has disadvantages too. Consumers can effectively screen out most messages. \n Marketers may think their ads are more effective than they really are if bogus clicks are generated by \nsoftware-powered websites. Advertisers also lose some control over their online messages, which can \nbe hacked or vandalized. But the pros clearly can outweigh the cons, and the share of online advertising \nhas shown continuous growth in the past decade.\nAn increasingly popular form of online advertising is native advertising , which involves materi -\nals resembling the publication\u2019s editorial content but is intended to promote the advertiser\u2019s product. In \nother words, native ads are paid commercial messages that match the look and feel of the publication \nin which they appear. Unlike traditional advertising, native advertising is designed to be non-disruptive \nand to look like part of the editorial flow of the publication.\nNative ads come in three common formats: (1) content recommendations, such as suggested arti -\ncles that appear below an article featuring editorial content, (2) \u201cin-feed\u201d advertisements that appear in \nthe news feed on social networks, and (3) search listings and promoted listings that appear above the \nresults of an organic Google search.\nWith its non-disruptive approach, native advertising has grown in popularity worldwide. \nAlthough it is utilized primarily in online communications, native advertising is also used in tradi -\ntional media formats including print, television, and radio. For example, a magazine might feature an \narticle that is developed jointly with the editorial staff and the advertiser in an informative, engaging, \nand highly readable way that promotes a particular product, service, or brand.\nPLACE ADVERTISING\nPlace advertising is a broad category that includes many creative and unexpected forms to grab con -\nsumers\u2019 attention where they work, play, and, of course, shop. Popular options include billboards, \npublic spaces, product placement, and point of purchase.\nBillboards.  Billboards use colorful, digitally produced images, graphics, backlighting, sounds, and \nmovement. Outdoor advertising is often called the \u201c15-second sell\u201d because consumers have a fleeting \nexposure to the ad and must grasp its message almost instantly. In New York, manhole covers have \nbeen reimagined as steaming cups of Folgers coffee; in Belgium, eBay posted \u201cMoved to eBay\u201d stickers \non empty storefronts; and in Germany, imaginary workers toiling inside vending machines, ATMs, \nand photo booths were justification for a German job-hunting website to proclaim, \u201cLife Is Too Short \nfor the Wrong Job.\u201d12\nA strong creative message can make all the difference. Chang Soda Water in Bangkok had enough \nmoney in its budget for only one digital billboard. To maximize impact, it built a giant bubbling bottle \nonto the billboard to illustrate the product\u2019s carbonation. Word-of-mouth buzz quintupled bottle sales \nfrom 200,000 to 1 million.13\nPublic Spaces.  Ads are appearing in such unconventional places as movie screens, airplane bod -\nies, and fitness equipment, as well as in classrooms, sports arenas, office and hotel elevators, and other \npublic places.

Marketers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for their products to make \ncameo appearances in movies and on television.14 Sometimes such product placements are the result \nof a larger network advertising deal, but small product-placement shops also maintain ties with prop \nmasters, set designers, and production executives.\nSome firms get product placement at no cost. Nike does not pay to be in movies but often sup -\nplies shoes, jackets, bags, and so on. Increasingly, products and brands are being woven directly into \nthe story, as when a new iPad for the gadget-loving dad of Modern Family  became the story arc of a \nwhole episode. In some cases, however, brands pay for the rights to appear in a movie. Consider the \ncase of\u00a0 Skyfall:\nSkyfall  With Skyfall , the 23rd film in the franchise, Heineken reportedly paid almost \n$40\u00a0million for James Bond to drink its beer instead of his traditional vodka martini\u2014a sum that \ncovered one-third of the film\u2019s estimated production budget. Marketers with the most on-screen \npresence after Heineken\u2019s in the film included Adidas, Aston Martin, Audi, Omega, Sony, and \nTom Ford. One research firm estimated that brands recognized in the film received more than \n$7.6 million worth of exposure during its opening weekend. Some brands featured their product \nplacement in the movie off screen, too. Heineken shot an extravagant 90-second ad featuring \nan inventive chase on a train that ended with a cameo appearance by Daniel Craig, the British \nactor playing Bond at that time.

There are many ways to communicate at the point of purchase (P-O-P), \nincluding ads on shopping carts, cart straps, aisles, and shelves and with in-store demonstrations, live \nsampling, and instant coupon machines.16 Some supermarkets are selling floor space for company \nlogos and experimenting with talking shelves.

Ease of use  typi -\ncally means that the content is easy to understand and navigate. Physical attractiveness  reflects the aesthetic \nappeal of the website, including factors such as layout, fonts, and color coordination. These features of \na website can help facilitate sales. For example, J. D. Power found that consumers who were \u201cdelighted\u201d \nwith an automotive manufacturer\u2019s website were more likely to test drive one of its vehicles as a result.18\nAs we describe in more detail later, firms such as comscore and Nielsen track where consumers \ngo online through measures like number of page views, number of unique visitors, length of visit, and \nso on. Companies must also be sensitive to online security and privacy-protection issues. One set of \nresearchers recommends transforming various \u201ctouch points\u201d related to website privacy into a positive \ncustomer experience by developing user-centric privacy controls that avoid multiple intrusions and \nprevent human intrusion by using automation whenever possible.19\nBesides their websites, companies may employ microsites: individual pages or clusters of pages \nthat function as supplements to a primary site. People rarely visit an insurance company\u2019s website, for \nexample, but the company can create a microsite on used-car sites that offers advice for buyers of used \ncars\u2014and a good insurance deal at the same time.\nDRIVING ONLINE TRAFFIC\nAn important component of online marketing is driving traffic to the company\u2019s own media. There \nare two common approaches to drive traffic: search engine optimization and search engine marketing.\nSearch engine optimization (SEO)  describes activities designed to improve the likelihood that \na link for a brand ranks as high as possible in the order of all nonpaid links when consumers search \nfor relevant terms. Because SEO involves optimizing the company\u2019s own website without paying a \nthird party to generate traffic, it is significantly less costly to implement than search engine marketing.\nSearch engine marketing (SEM)  describes activities whereby the company pays search engine \ncompanies to be featured in the results of particular keyword searches that serve as a proxy for the \nconsumer\u2019s product or consumption interests. When consumers search for any of these words with \nGoogle, the marketer\u2019s ad may appear above or next to the results, depending on the amount the com -\npany bids and an algorithm the search engines use to determine an ad\u2019s relevance to a particular search. \nFor example, McDonald\u2019s might pay Google for its information to appear among the results generated \nwhen consumers search for a particular word or phrase, such as \u201cburger,\u201d \u201cFrench fries,\u201d or \u201cfast food.\u201d\nAdvertisers typically pay only if people click on the links, but marketers believe consumers who \nhave already expressed interest by engaging in search are prime prospects. The cost per click depends \non how high the link is ranked on the page and the popularity of the keyword. The ever-increasing \npopularity of paid search has increased competition among keyword bidders, significantly raising \nsearch ad prices and putting a premium on choosing the best possible keywords, bidding on them \nstrategically, and monitoring the results for effectiveness and efficiency.\nA number of guidelines have been suggested as part of SEO and SEM.20 For example, broader \nsearch terms (\u201ciPhone\u201d or \u201cburger\u201d) are useful for general brand building; more specific ones identifying \na particular product model or service (\u201cApple iPhone XS Max\u201d) are useful for generating and converting \nsales leads. Search terms need to be spotlighted on the appropriate pages of the marketer\u2019s website so \nsearch engines can easily identify them. Any one product can usually be identified by means of mul -\ntiple keywords, but marketers must bid on each keyword according to its probable return on revenue.\nSocial Media\nAn important component of digital marketing is social media. Social media are a means for consum -\ners to share text, images, audio, and video information with one another and with companies, and \nvice\u00a0versa.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4873, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65b5506f-f985-4fe0-a222-cb4915cf7a81": {"__data__": {"id_": "65b5506f-f985-4fe0-a222-cb4915cf7a81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e81e150-fc16-47f6-97fb-437a0aef0e1a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "7cab3ce475dc9587c10403763669f78c4f65be1371791a4f85c88fcde1b9af5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "303cd4eb-fa11-4c7c-bbee-a09a266707dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "5a90a54c3cd7dade06a23f3c40c95f53737a9722978c8109cc90886e60bd3f87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "67b20eec-2d4f-4085-a78b-52e82c2f39ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81705abecd71d64f8cbb3eb8bcf34b97d0dd9cd1099efd4ae77b8ccb47b77168", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 13    |  DESIGNING  AN INTEG rATED  MArKETING  CAMPAIGN  IN THE DIGITAL  AGE 291\nSocial media enable marketers to establish a public voice and presence online. They can also cost-\nefficiently reinforce other communication activities. In addition, because of their day-to-day imme -\ndiacy, they can encourage companies to stay innovative and relevant. Marketers can build or tap into \nonline communities, inviting participation from consumers and creating a long-term marketing asset \nin the process.\nTHE GROWTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA\nSocial media allow consumers to become engaged with a brand at perhaps a deeper and broader level \nthan ever before. Marketers should do everything they can to encourage willing consumers to engage \nproductively. But as useful as they may be, social media are rarely the sole source of marketing com -\nmunications for a brand.\nResearch suggests that brands and products vary widely in how social they are online. Consumers \nare most likely to engage with media, charities, and fashion and least likely to engage with consumer \ngoods.21 Although consumers may use social media to get useful information, deals, and promotions \nor to enjoy interesting or entertaining brand-created content, a much smaller percentage use social \nmedia to engage in two-way \u201cconversations\u201d with brands. In short, marketers must recognize that \nwhen it comes to social media, only some  consumers want to engage with some  brands\u2014and even then, \nonly some  of the time.\nOne challenge faced by social media marketers is the speed with which they are expected to react \nto relevant news and events. The \u201calways-on\u201d connectivity has conditioned consumers to expect an \nalmost instant company response. This, in turn, forces companies to develop new communication \ncapabilities enabling them to react to problems and opportunities in real time by shaping the social \nmedia conversation and taking actions to rectify problems and take advantage of opportunities.\nEmbracing social media, harnessing word of mouth, and creating buzz also require companies to \ntake the good with the bad.22 When Frito-Lay\u2019s \u201cDo Us a Flavor\u201d contest invited U.S. fans to suggest new \npotato chip flavors for a chance to win a huge cash prize, the Facebook app for submissions crashed the \nfirst day due to high traffic. The promotion got back on track, though, with the winner, Cheesy Garlic \nBread\u2013flavored chips, joining earlier winners from other countries, such as Caesar salad\u2013flavored chips \nin Australia and shrimp chips in Egypt.23\nThe Frito-Lay example illustrates the power and speed of social media, but also the challenges \nthey pose to companies. The reality, however, is that whether a company chooses to engage in social \nmedia or not, the internet will always permit scrutiny and criticism from consumers and organizations. \nBy using social media and the internet in a constructive, thoughtful way, firms at least have a means \nto create a strong online presence and to offer credible alternative points of view if negative feedback \noccurs. And if the firm has built a strong online community, members of that community will often \nrush to defend the brand and play a policing role regarding inaccurate or unfair characterizations.\nSOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS\nThere are four main platforms for social media: online communities and forums, blogs, social net -\nworks, and customer reviews.\nOnline Communities and Forums.  Online communities and forums come in all shapes \nand sizes. Many are created by consumers or groups of consumers with no commercial interests or \ncompany affiliations. Others are sponsored by companies whose members communicate with the \ncompany and with one another through postings, text messaging, and chat discussions about special \ninterests related to the company\u2019s products and brands. These online communities and forums can be \na valuable resource for companies and perform multiple functions by both collecting and conveying \nkey information.\nA key for success in online communities is to create individual and group activities that help form \nbonds among community members. Apple hosts a large number of discussion groups organized by \nproduct line and type of user (consumer or professional). These groups are customers\u2019 primary source \nof product information after warranties expire.\nThe two-way information flow in online communities and forums can provide companies with \nuseful, hard-to-get customer information and insights. When GlaxoSmithKline prepared to launch its \nfirst weight-loss drug, Alli, it sponsored a weight-loss community. The firm felt the feedback it gained \nwas more valuable than what it could have received from traditional focus groups.

LEGO\u2019s global crowdsourcing platform produced a \nnumber of successful products, including a series of sets based on the hugely popular Minecraft game.24\nBlogs.  Blogs, regularly updated online journals or diaries, have become an important outlet for word \nof mouth. There are millions in existence, and they vary widely; some are personal for close friends and \nfamilies, and others are designed to reach and influence a vast audience. One obvious appeal of blogs \nis that they bring together people with common interests.\nCorporations are creating their own blogs and carefully monitoring those of others.25 Because \nmany consumers examine product information and reviews contained in blogs, the Federal Trade \nCommission has also taken steps to require bloggers to disclose their relationship with marketers \nwhose products they endorse. At the other extreme, some consumers use blogs and videos as a means \nof getting retribution for a company\u2019s bad service or faulty products.\nSocial Networks.  Social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, \nand WeChat have become an important force in both business-to-consumer and business-to-business \nmarketing.26\nMarketers are still learning how best to tap into social networks and their huge, well-defined audi -\nences.27 Given networks\u2019 noncommercial nature\u2014users are generally there looking to connect with \nothers\u2014attracting attention and persuading are challenging. Also, given that users generate their own \ncontent, ads may appear beside inappropriate or even offensive material.\nMuch online content is not necessarily shared and does not go viral. Only a small fraction of \ncontent ends up \u201ccascading\u201d to more than one person beyond the initial recipient. In deciding whether \nto contribute to social media, consumers can be motivated by intrinsic factors such as whether they \nare having fun or learning, but more often they are swayed by extrinsic factors such as social and self-\nimage considerations.28\nHarvard Business School viral video expert Thales Teixeira offers the following advice for get -\nting a viral ad shared. Utilize brand pulsing: Display the brand for short periods of time in a way that \ndoesn\u2019t make the brand too intrusive within the story, open with joy or surprise to hook those fickle \nviewers who are easily bored, build an emotional roller coaster within the ad to keep viewers engaged \nthroughout, and surprise but don\u2019t shock; if an ad makes viewers too uncomfortable, they are unlikely \nto share it.29\nViral marketing tries to create a splash in the marketplace to showcase a brand and its noteworthy \nfeatures. Some believe viral marketing efforts are driven more by the rules of entertainment than by the \nrules of selling. Consider these examples: Quicksilver puts out surfing videos and surf-culture books \nfor teens, Johnson & Johnson and Pampers both have popular websites with parenting advice, Walmart \nplaces videos with money-saving tips on YouTube, Grey Goose vodka has an entire entertainment \ndivision, Mountain Dew has a record label, and Hasbro is joining forces with Discovery to create a TV \nchannel.30 Ultimately, however, the success of any viral or word-of-mouth buzz campaign depends on \nthe willingness of consumers to talk to other consumers.\nAn increasingly important component of a company\u2019s online communication is the use of social \nmedia influencers. The term influencer marketing  refers to the use of a popular online figure to \npromote a product, service, or brand within his or her social media feed. Strictly speaking, influencer \nmarketing can be viewed as a mix of publicity and paid endorsement that takes place in the context of \nsocial media. Here, the company pays the endorser to promote its offerings, but rather than using this \nendorsement in its own communications, the company relies on the influencer\u2019s own social media \nnetworks to disseminate the message.\nInfluencer marketing has grown rapidly in recent years to become a multibillion-dollar industry. \nThis rapid growth has presented marketers with several challenges.

As advertis -\ners become aware of the importance of authenticating the influencers\u2019 real impact, they employ compa -\nnies that serve as social media detectives. These companies evaluate influencers\u2019 social media activity, \nlooking for signs of bot activity to determine the percentage of \u201creal\u201d followers, views, and visitors.\nCustomer Reviews.  Customer reviews can be especially influential in shaping customer pref -\nerences and buying decisions.33 One Nielsen survey found that online customer reviews were the \n second most trusted source of brand information (after recommendations from friends and family).34 \nResearch has shown that social influence can lead to disproportionately positive online ratings, and \nsubsequent raters are more likely to be influenced by previous positive ratings than by negative ones. \nConsumers posting reviews are susceptible to conformity pressures and to adopting the norms of \nothers.35 On the other hand, positive online reviews or ratings are often not as influential or valued \nas negative ones.36\nConsumers are also influenced by the online opinions and recommendations of other consumers. \nThe informal social networks that arise among consumers complement the product networks set up by \nthe company.37 Online \u201cinfluentials\u201d who are one of a few people\u2014or maybe even the only person\u2014to \ninfluence certain consumers are particularly important and valuable to companies.38\nMobile Communication\nU.S. consumers spend a considerable amount of time on mobile\u2014more than on radio, magazines, \nand newspapers combined.39 Given the omnipresence of smartphones and tablets, and marketers\u2019 \nability to personalize messages based on demographics and other consumer behavior characteristics, \nthe appeal of mobile marketing as a communication tool is obvious.\nWharton\u2019s David Bell notes four distinctive characteristics of a mobile device: (1) It is uniquely \ntied to one user. (2) It is virtually always \u201con\u201d since it is typically carried everywhere. (3) It allows for \nimmediate consumption because it is in effect a channel of distribution with a payment system. (4) It \nis highly interactive, given that it allows for geotracking and picture and video taking.40\nMobile ad spending has grown dramatically worldwide. With the increased capabilities of smart -\nphones, however, mobile ads can be more than just a display medium using static \u201cmini-billboards.\u201d \nMuch recent interest has been generated in mobile apps adding convenience, social value, incentives, \nand entertainment and making consumers\u2019 lives a little or a lot better.41\nSmart mobile devices are also conducive to boosting loyalty programs in which customers can \ntrack their visits to and purchases from a merchant and receive rewards. By tracking the whereabouts \nof receptive customers who opt to receive communications, retailers can send them location-specific \npromotions when they are near shops or outlets. Sonic Corp. used GPS data and proximity to cell \ntowers in Atlanta to identify when those customers who had signed up for company communications \nwere near one of roughly 50 Sonic restaurants in the area. When that was the case, the company sent \ncustomers a text message with a discount offer or an ad to entice them to visit the restaurant.42\nBecause traditional coupon redemption rates have been declining for years, the ability of mobile \nto make more relevant and timely offers to consumers at or near the point of purchase has piqued the \ninterest of many marketers. These new coupons can take many forms, and digital in-store signs can \ndispense them to smartphones. With user privacy safeguards in place, marketers\u2019 greater knowledge \nof cross-screen identities (online and mobile) can permit more relevant, targeted ads.\nUnderstanding how consumers want to use their smart phones is critical to understanding the role \nof advertising. Given the small screen and fleeting attention paid, fulfilling advertising\u2019s traditional role \nof informing and persuading is more challenging on mobile devices. On the plus side, consumers are \nmore engaged and attentive when using their smartphones than when they are online. Nevertheless, a \nnumber of m-commerce companies are eliminating ads to allow consumers to make purchases with \nas few clicks as possible.43\nEvents and Experiences\nBecoming part of a personally relevant moment in consumers\u2019 lives through sponsored events and \nexperiences can broaden and deepen a company\u2019s or brand\u2019s relationship with the target market. \nDaily encounters with brands may also affect consumers\u2019 brand attitudes and beliefs.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b00a02c-bb67-4bb2-9143-421b1c468035": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b00a02c-bb67-4bb2-9143-421b1c468035", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70f67fe8-f786-4448-b0c4-1f347fb9c011", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "f72cb4689389a673fee3be9a545ca9843865b1a6366d2724c39b55caf8be968c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a113900-a3c6-4cfd-9834-8adf1c62918e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "446867eb630e01fad77cde919ee98f552c420f26c715fc49a51d6d2ddc6a08e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "792b04e1-de6d-413d-b46e-79ee2224e146", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c023bf214b3b8eccb04e4ffa59ed6e2b3724fefb3aaecb7e32aa7822f820f29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "294 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nMANAGING EVENTS\nMarketers report a number of reasons to sponsor events:\n\u2022 To identify with a particular target market or lifestyle.  Old Spice sponsors college sports\u2014including its \ncollege basketball Old Spice Classic in late November\u2014to highlight product relevance and sample \namong its target audience of 16- to 24-year-old males.\n\u2022 To increase the salience of a company or product name.  Events offer sustained exposure to a brand, a \nnecessary condition for reinforcing brand salience. Top-of-mind awareness for soccer World Cup \nsponsors Emirates Airlines, Hyundai, Kia, and Sony benefited from the repeated brand and ad \nexposure over the month-long tournament.\n\u2022 To create or reinforce perceptions of key brand image associations.  Events themselves have associations that help  \nto create or reinforce brand associations.44 To toughen its image and appeal to the heartland, Toyota  \nTundra sponsors B.A.S.S. fishing tournaments and has sponsored Brooks & Dunn country music tours.\n\u2022 To enhance corporate image.  Sponsoring and organizing events can improve perceptions that the \ncompany is likable and prestigious. Although Visa views its long-standing Olympic sponsorship \nas a means of enhancing international brand awareness and increasing usage and volume, it also \nengenders patriotic goodwill and taps into the emotional Olympic spirit. McDonald\u2019s sponsors \ncommunity-based programs to build goodwill, including Black & Positively Golden, which cel -\nebrates Black culture.\n\u2022 To create experiences and evoke feelings.  The feelings engendered by an exciting or rewarding event may \nindirectly link to the brand. Audi models featured prominently in the blockbuster film franchise \nIron Man , including main character Tony Stark\u2019s personal R8 Spyder, the A8 and A3, as well as the \nQ5 and Q7 SUVs.\n\u2022 To express commitment to the community or on social issues.  Cause-related events sponsor nonprofit \norganizations and charities. Firms such as Timberland, Stonyfield Farms, Home Depot, Starbucks, \nAmerican Express, and Tom\u2019s of Maine have made their support of causes an important corner -\nstone of their marketing programs.\n\u2022 To entertain key clients or reward key employees.  Many events include lavish hospitality tents and other \nspecial services or activities for sponsors and their guests only. These perks engender goodwill and \nestablish valuable business contacts. From an employee perspective, events can also build participa -\ntion and morale or serve as an incentive. BB&T Corp., a major banking and financial services player \nin the U.S. South and Southeast, used its NASCAR Busch Series sponsorship to entertain business \ncustomers and its minor league baseball sponsorship to generate excitement among employees.\n\u2022 To permit merchandising or promotional opportunities.  Many marketers tie contests or sweepstakes, \nin-store merchandising, direct response, or other marketing activities to an event. Ford and  \nCoca-Cola have used their sponsorship of the popular TV show American Idol  in this way.\nDespite these potential advantages, the result of an event can still be unpredictable and beyond \nthe sponsor\u2019s control. And although many consumers credit sponsors for providing the financial assis -\ntance to make an event possible, some may resent their commercialization of the event.\nCREATING EXPERIENCES\nExperiential marketing not only communicates features and benefits but also connects a product or \nservice with unique and interesting experiences. Rather than focusing on selling, experiential mar -\nketing aims to let customers experience how the company\u2019s offering fits in their life. Many firms are \ncreating their own events and experiences to stimulate consumer and media interest and involvement.\nA popular form of experiential marketing involves event sponsorship. Making sponsorships suc -\ncessful requires choosing the appropriate events, designing the optimal sponsorship program, and \nmeasuring the effects of sponsorship. Because of the number of sponsorship opportunities and their \nhuge cost, marketers must be selective. The event must meet the marketing objectives and commu -\nnication strategy defined for the brand. It must have sufficient awareness, possess the desired image, \nand be able to create the desired effects. The audience must match the target market and must have a \nfavorable attitude toward the sponsor\u2019s engagement. An ideal event also is unique but not encumbered \nby many sponsors, lends itself to ancillary marketing activities, and reflects or enhances the sponsor\u2019s \nbrand or corporate image.45\nCompanies can even create a strong image by inviting prospects and customers to visit their head -\nquarters and factories.46 Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Boeing, Crayola, and Hershey\u2019s all sponsor excellent company \ntours that draw millions of visitors a year.

At the end of the trip, customers can drop off their car for \ntransatlantic shipment. For example, Mercedes-Benz offers up to 7 percent off the purchase price for \nEuropean delivery and waives the usual destination charge. It also offers an airfare voucher, one night\u2019s \nhotel accommodations, and a tour of the factory and museum.47\nWord of Mouth\nConsumers use word of mouth  to talk about dozens of brands each day, from media and entertainment \nproducts such as movies, TV shows, and publications to food products, travel services, and retail \nstores. Companies are acutely aware of word-of-mouth power. Hush Puppies shoes, Krispy Kreme \ndoughnuts, and (more recently) Crocs shoes were built through strong word of mouth, as were com -\npanies such as Red Bull, Starbucks, and Amazon.com.\nViral marketing relies on word of mouth that encourages consumers to pass along audio, video, \nor written information about company-developed products and services to others online.48 With user-\ngenerated content sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, consumers and advertisers can \nupload ads and videos to be shared by millions of people.49 Online videos can be cost-effective, and \nmarketers can take more freedom with them, as Blendtec has done.\nBlendtec  Utah-based Blendtec used to be known primarily for its commercial blenders \nand food mills. The company wasn\u2019t really familiar to the general public until it launched a \nseries of hilarious \u201cWill It Blend?\u201d online videos to promote some of its commercial products \nfor home use. The videos feature founder and CEO Tom Dickson wearing a white lab coat to \npulverize objects ranging from golf balls and pens to beer bottles, all in a genial but deadpan \nmanner. The genius of the videos (www.willitblend.com) is that they tie into current events. \nAs\u00a0soon as the iPhone was launched with huge media fanfare, Blendtec aired a video in \nwhich Dickson smiled and said, \u201cI\u00a0love my iPhone. It does everything. But will it blend?\u201d After \nthe blender crushed the iPhone to bits, Dickson lifted the lid on the small pile of black dust \nand said simply, \u201ciSmoke.\u201d The clip drew more than 3.5 million views on YouTube. Dickson \nhas appeared on Today  and other network television shows and has had a cameo in a Weezer \nvideo. One of the few items not to blend: a crowbar!50\nOutrageousness is a two-edged sword. The Blendtec website clearly puts its comic videos in the \n\u201cDon\u2019t  try this at home\u201d category and developed another set showing how to grind up vegetables for \nsoup, for instance, in the \u201c Do try this at home\u201d category. Another product that has greatly benefited \nfrom word of mouth is SodaStream.\nSodaStream  SodaStream, a product that allows consumers to carbonate regular tap water  \nat home to replace store-bought sodas, was built with minimal media spend thanks to the \npower of word of mouth. To help promote conversation about the brand, the company has \nsampled liberally, used product placement, and engaged with affinity groups such as \u201cgreen\u201d \norganizations, which might be interested in home carbonation because of its environmental \nadvantages, and with boat and rV owners because it offers the convenience of not having to \nstore bottles and cans. Former CEO Daniel Birnbaum notes, \u201cI would much rather invest in P r \nthan in advertising, because with P r it\u2019s not me talking\u2014it\u2019s someone else.\u201d One of SodaStream\u2019s \nmost successful marketing activities is \u201cThe Cage.\u201d The company calculates the average number \nof cans and bottles thrown away by a family in a year in a given country and then fills a giant \ncage-like box to hold them, placing it in high-traffic locations like airports to draw attention to it.51\nA classic example of the use of word of mouth is the way Dollar Shave Club used social media to \ncreate a viral communication campaign that helped build its brand.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4504, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5cf05b2-09d0-4a1d-8a3c-1a4a0b5a91fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5cf05b2-09d0-4a1d-8a3c-1a4a0b5a91fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1bd00481-87cb-4c00-9f06-fe1c89008312", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "c5b65cf4dbc37685f94574364509238d87aef74f6bfa9ff9d7fe5d729bcb4e4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "792b04e1-de6d-413d-b46e-79ee2224e146", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "e3977f090f9e53ba4fe31c3e5c3bf2fd9efd81999b74c0d5dca268ca729fe32e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec24c476-0ab4-488f-b6fe-7e42a0534968", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c43f7bf00e4836957a076d03af3c126d95ee2da25b816565a62d949c1f60673c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "296 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nDollar Shave Club  E-commerce start-up Dollar \nShave Club sells a low-priced monthly supply of razors \nand blades online based on three different plans.

Increasingly, publicity takes place online, but it must be planned jointly with advertising \nand other marketing communications.\nPublicity has important advantages over traditional advertising. First, publicity is free\u2014even \nthough the advertiser might have to pay an agency to secure media coverage, the advertiser does not \npay for cost of the media itself (e.g., television and radio time or newspaper and magazine space). In \naddition, because the source of the message is a third party rather than the company, publicity is more \ncredible and is more likely to influence the target audience. The main downside of publicity is that it \ncannot be directly controlled by the company and, as a result, it might end up being irrelevant or can \neven hurt the company and its offerings. Thus, the lack of a predictable outcome is the price associated \nwith the low cost and credibility of publicity.\nPublicity can achieve multiple objectives. It can build awareness  by placing stories in the media to \nbring attention to a product, service, person, organization, or idea. It can build credibility  by communi -\ncating the message in an editorial context. It can help boost sales force and dealer enthusiasm  with stories \nabout a new product before it is launched. It can hold down promotion cost  because publicity costs less \nthan direct mail and media advertising.\nPublicity plays an important role in a variety of tasks:\n\u2022 Launching new products.

An interesting story picked up by the media can be worth millions of \ndollars in equivalent advertising. Some experts say consumers are five times more likely to be influ -\nenced by editorial copy than by advertising. The following is an example of an award-winning publicity \ncampaign.\nMeow Mix  A heritage brand, Meow Mix Cat Food decided to tap into its roots and bring \nback one of its most identifiable brand elements\u2014a jingle with a repetitive meow refrain that had \nbeen off the air for over 20 years. Marketers chose singer and TV reality coach CeeLo Green and \nhis Persian cat Purrfect to do the honors. The video with Green singing a remixed version of the \njingle in a duet with Purrfect garnered attention from all kinds of outlets. The story received  \n1,200 media placements and 535 million media impressions, including exclusives with AP and \nAccess Hollywood . Web traffic for the brand rose 150 percent, and more than 10,000 fans \ndownloaded the song or ringtone.

They provide press \ncoverage by presenting news and information about the organization in the most positive light. They \nalso manage corporate communications by promoting understanding of the organization through \ninternal and external communications. Finally, PR departments can engage in lobbying by dealing with \nlegislators and government officials to promote or defeat legislation and regulation.\nPublic relations can involve different media formats. Some of the most popular PR media formats \nare publications, events, news, speeches, public service activities, and identity media.\n\u2022 Publications.  Companies rely extensively on published materials to reach and influence their \ntarget markets. These include annual reports, brochures, articles, company newsletters and maga -\nzines, and audiovisual materials.\n\u2022 Events.  Companies can draw attention to new products or other company activities by arranging \nand publicizing special events such as news conferences, seminars, outings, trade shows, exhibits, \ncontests and competitions, and anniversaries that will reach the target publics.\n\u2022 News.  One of the major tasks of PR professionals is to find or create favorable news about the \ncompany, its products, and its people and to get the media to accept press releases and attend \npress conferences.\n\u2022 Speeches.  Increasingly, company executives must field questions from the media or give talks at \ntrade associations or sales meetings, appearances that can build the company\u2019s image.\n\u2022 Public service activities.  Companies can build goodwill by contributing money and time to \ngood causes.\n\u2022 Identity media.  Companies need a visual identity that the public immediately recognizes. The \nvisual identity is carried by company logos, stationery, brochures, signs, business forms, business \ncards, buildings, uniforms, and dress codes.\nPublic relations helps companies shape their public image and manage their relationships with \nthe community. Furthermore, public relations are particularly relevant in minimizing the damage to \nthe corporate image during a marketing crisis, as well as in helping rebuild this image after the crisis \nhas been resolved.\nPackaging\nBecause packaging is usually perceived during a buyer\u2019s first encounter with the product, it can be a \ndetermining factor in piquing the buyer\u2019s interest. It will also shape the buyer\u2019s subsequent evaluation \nof the product and the final purchase decision. Because of its ability to influence consumer percep -\ntions and choice, many companies use packaging to create distinct customer value and differentiate \ntheir products from those of the competition.57\nThe label  is a highly visible and important element of packaging. Labels include written, electronic, \nor graphical communication placed directly on the packaging, as well as anything associated with and \nattached to the product, such as an information tag. The label\u2019s primary functions are to communi -\ncate, to consumers, channel members, and the company, information that facilitates identification of \nthe offering; describes the offering\u2019s key attributes; highlights the offering\u2019s benefits; instructs buyers \non the proper use, storage, and disposal of the product; increases the offering\u2019s aesthetic appeal; and \nleverages and enhances the brand associated with the offering.\nFollowing a set of three core packaging principles can help develop effective packaging that con -\ntributes to the product\u2019s ultimate success in the market. These core principles are visibility , differentiation , \nand transparency .\n\u2022 Visibility.  Companies endeavoring to promote their offerings often overwhelm consumers with \na constant barrage of information. This information overload can be counterproductive, causing \ncustomers to tune out and ignore the information they don\u2019t think will be immediately relevant \nto the decision at hand. This surfeit of information can also cause shoppers to overlook data \nthat might be useful to them. Effective packaging can cut through the information clutter, arrest \nthe attention of shoppers, and induce them to consider the offering favorably and ultimately to \npurchase it.

In addition to attracting consum -\ners\u2019 attention and differentiating the company\u2019s \nofferings from the competition, effective packag -\ning clearly communicates the value of the offering \nto its target customers.

Unlike advertising, which typically aims \nto create a memorable impression of an offering in \nthe minds of future purchasers, packaging often is \ndesigned to have a more direct visual impact on the \nbuyer.

Mobile communications  are an increasingly important \nform of interactive marketing by which marketers can \nuse text messages, apps, and ads to connect with con -\nsumers via their smartphones, tablets, and wearable \ndevices.

However, in the next three decades, Burger King \nsaw 13 CEOs come in and out of the company, each one \ntaking the company in a different direction. With constant \nchanges to management, Burger King faced different chal-\nlenges, which were followed by a decline in revenues. Some \nof these issues included a series of ineffective advertising \ncampaigns, an overly complicated menu, and changes in \ncustomer preferences.\nSource: Cum Okolo/Alamy Stock Photo\n( continued  )", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eae851c8-05c2-419e-a0ef-6a094d5bf6bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "eae851c8-05c2-419e-a0ef-6a094d5bf6bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29273247-24f3-4098-96c5-a7b875f686b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "4eb1ed238a86dbb57754cb38e44b0251742d916e9f6d3596df094aa3ac436ec1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d624875f-1c1c-4afd-b5ca-137d2bcc0cd7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap13.pdf"}, "hash": "1e382cbebdcc6ea6cbd89547e652950117108119eb403d34460b756019359803", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "93efbff1-d2cf-4b97-909e-6cf0b38cd73b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "453919bc59311c592b4da2769246ab6d6c3c81aea78b604f4116f365b7cce9c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "302 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nthe larger size and superior freshness of its burgers. The \nfamous slogan \u201cHave it your way\u201d was launched in 1974. \nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Burger King released a series of \ncampaigns that failed to resonate with customers. The \n\u201cWhere\u2019s Herb?\u201d campaign, launched in 1986, focused on \na man who had never tasted a Whopper before. Burger \nKing offered $5,000 to any guest who could find Herb as \nhe toured across the country. The campaign was meant \nto rival Wendy\u2019s famous \u201cWhere\u2019s the Beef\u201d campaign but \nfailed to garner the same amount of national attention. \nAdvertising Age  declared the campaign the biggest promo -\ntional flop of the decade.\nFollowing a change of management in the early 2000s, \nBurger King revamped its advertising style to be riskier and \nincorporate more tongue-in-cheek humor. In 2004, Burger \nKing launched its \u201cSubservient Chicken\u201d website, where peo-\nple could watch a human-sized chicken act out their com-\nmands, reviving the \u201cHave it your way\u201d tagline. The website \nreceived over 20 million hits in the week it debuted. In 2007, \nBurger King released the \u201cWhopper Freakout\u201d campaign, \nwhere angry customers were secretly filmed after being told \nby employees that the Whopper had been discontinued. \nThe campaign went viral and was followed by a 4.5 percent \nincrease in store sales.\nWhereas some of Burger King\u2019s campaigns were suc-\ncessful and helped build the company\u2019s brand, others \nbackfired and reflected poorly on the company\u2019s image. The \nadvertisement for the \u201cTexican Whopper\u201d sandwich in 2009 \noutraged the Mexican government because of its stereo-\ntypical caricature of a tall white cowboy living with a small \nMexican wrestler. The \u201cSpongeBob Square Butt\u201d advertise-\nment was also controversial because the highly sexualized \nad primarily targeted young consumers. Mental health orga-\nnizations also took offense at advertisements such as \u201cThe \nKing\u2019s Gone Crazy\u201d because of its crude depiction of mental \nillness. In 2011, Time  magazine called The King mascot one \nof the 10 creepiest product mascots. In short, although some \nadvertisements succeeded in increasing sales, Burger King \nwas becoming less and less successful at leaving a good \nimpression on fans.\nIn 2010, Burger King was sold to 3G Capital, which \nlooked to optimize operations and overhaul the company\u2019s \nadvertising strategy in order to increase profitability. After \nits acquisition by 3G Capital, Burger King began stream -\nlining its operations. The company employed a strategy \nof cost cutting and zero-base budgeting, which involved \nheavily scrutinizing its expenses and resetting its budget to \nzero every planning period. These new initiatives included \nredesigning restaurants to improve the guest experience, reducing the menu to focus on the burgers and fries, and \nselling some of the company-owned restaurants back to \nfranchisees.\nAlongside 3G Capital\u2019s acquisition came a new part -\nnership with marketing agency McGarryBowen, which \nrevamped Burger King\u2019s advertising strategy, taking it back \nto its tongue-in-cheek roots. The media team launched a \nseries of creative campaigns that offered topical political or \ncultural commentary. One of the most successful campaigns \nrevolved around the \u201cWhopper Neutrality\u201d video, which was \nreleased shortly after the repeal of net neutrality in the United \nStates. The video explains the effects of a net neutrality \nban, using Whopper pricing as an analog. The controversial \nadvertisement became Burger King\u2019s most shared ad of all \ntime, garnering over 4 billion hits and a reference during a \ncongressional hearing. Burger King mocked artificial intel -\nligence\u2019s capacity for creativity by releasing a bizarre set of \nadvertisements completely generated by machine-learning \nalgorithms.\nOther communications released by Burger King offered \nsocial commentary on topics such as the \u201cpink tax\u201d (the \nfact that women\u2019s products cost more than men\u2019s),  bullying, \nand inclusion of deaf customers. Many advertisements were \nalso more lighthearted and humorous: Burger King offered \n Whoppers with holes cut out of the center to celebrate \nNational Donut Day, hid Whoppers in popcorn bags to \nbypass theater rules in romania, and even traded boarding \npasses for burgers in romania.
