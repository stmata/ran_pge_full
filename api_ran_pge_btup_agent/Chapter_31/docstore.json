Customers can switch suppliers at the click of a\nmouse; new technologies quickly render established firms obsolete;\nforeign competitors you never even knew existed ravage your\nnational market share; and competition is mildly described as fierce.\nAs globalization continues to foster closer social, economic and\npolitical ties, there is an increasing need for the new generation of\nmarketing managers to think in an international and integrative\nperspective.\nIf only our problems were only conceptual. Wanting more free\ntime, and convenience, customers are more sophisticated, less brand\nloyal and price sensitive than in the past, rendering traditional\nmarketing approaches less effective. We find in North America\nand W estern Europe a bifurcation of consumer\u2019s buying habits. It\nsounds rude, but what it means is that well off people are buying\nnot only at their traditional upscale department stores but are\nalso buying \u201ccheap and cheerful\u201d at Wal-Mart and other stores of\nthat ilk.

Each chapter is also divided into headings which\nare labelled making the task of outlining much easier. In addition,\nwe have taken great care in avoiding falling into the jargon trap\nthat unfortunately is all too prevalent in business.

Terms will be defined, the basics are\nexplained and an explanation is provided for why companies\nbecome customer oriented.\nChapter two, \u201cMarketing as a Corporate Function\u201dintroduces a\nbasic framework of how marketing fits in an organization and the\nplanning and analysis process managers must undertake in order to\nimplement programs that aim to achieve the organization\u2019s goals.\nSpecial attention will be made towards explaining competitive\nadvantage, core competencies, product and business cycles. The\nchapter concludes with a discussion of brands and the experiential\neconomy. Protecting brands is causing marketers to adapt their\nbehaviour from regimented practices to those of buzz marketing,\nwhere results are much more difficult to measure and predict.\nChapters three through six constitute the heart of the book. In\nthese chapters readers will learn the tools marketers use to influ-\nence the revenue of a product. Specifically, we discuss the five Ps of\nmarketing: product, placement, price, promotion, and people. We\nwill explore each of these topics in some detail and how these vari-\nables are used to craft a successful marketing plan that will build a\ncompetitive advantage for the firm.

Management is also a philosophy. Management is\nthe means to achieve an end. The late Peter Drucker, the doyen of\nmanagement gurus, once said that, \u201cThe purpose of a business is to\ncreate a customer\u201d. If you do that well, profits will follow. For\npublic institutions, they aim to increase social welfare for the public\nthey serve by redistributing tax revenue. For non-governmental\norganizations, their goal is improving the welfare of the disadvan-\ntaged, or promoting the observance of human rights or improving\nthe state of the natural environment. Though the goals of these\nthree types of organization are different, which in turn means the\ndecisions senior executives make will differ, all three operate with\nlimited resources. As such, the approaches taken to realize their\ngoals are remarkably similar. Management is the coordination of\nactivities to maximize limited resources enabling an organization\nto realize a stated goal or objective.\nThe idea of management dates back to the beginning of civiliza-\ntion. The root of the word management can be traced back to\nRoman times. The Latin word manum agere literally translates as\nlead by the hand, but more tellingly, also means using power and\njurisdiction to lead. The word management itself did not appear\nuntil the early Renaissance, with the French using the word\nm\u00e9nagement to describe the art of conducting. By 1589, the word\nwas absorbed into the English language. Less than 100 years later,\nthe words \u201cmanager\u201d and \u201cmanagement\u201d became common words\nin the English vocabulary and remain so today.\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement\nduring the 18th Century originating in Europe, classical econo-\nmists like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill formalized ideas about\nsatisfying human needs with limited resources. The two discussed\nhow scarcity affected the allocation of resources, methods of\nproduction, and how goods were priced. While academics discussed\nproblems related to scarcity, manufacturers experimented with\nproduction processes which led to an abundance of innovations:INTRODUCTION 5", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2340, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddd85ffa-9342-4f21-959e-da20f6d616a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddd85ffa-9342-4f21-959e-da20f6d616a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12a4d2f1-8e63-46cf-8ebe-febb5f7b5b8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "da6f4f44881d416636669eeaaf0407bd26b5ad7fac6828fabf9cf92ab7bee687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6bb0ed7-9854-4518-a613-dead7584300a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "17654bba5649e79ea13191c26ba17f13e40908488a8cdb347471e7e060a38527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73026543-380b-4a4c-b9c8-69f18c6f5b2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "617119ebdb0624cc3b03934a6bf31903585b3c3890c65b70af7456e7e3d19def", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "quality-control procedures, replaceable parts and mass-production\ntechniques quickly revealed their benefits. Mass production in\nparticular was one of the greatest innovations of that time. It utilized\nassembly lines and permitted high rates of production at a very low\ncost. These savings in turn resulted in high quality but inexpensive\nproducts. It is because of mass production, much of the material\nwealth we enjoy today exists.\nMass production also fostered the creation of the multinational\ncorporation, an organization that sought to vertically integrate itself\ncontrolling all factors of production, capturing all the profits within\neach production step, creating an immense amount of wealth for\nshareholders. However, at the same time, mass production meant\nworkers were forced to do the same, repetitive actions day in day out,\nnumbing both the brain and motivation. Workplace related injuries\nduring this time were unacceptably high by today\u2019s standards.\nThe first comprehensive theories of management appeared in the\n1920s. Henri Fayol was one of the first to explore the various\nbranches of management and their inter-relationships. Within the\nnext twenty years, academics from the arts and sciences began\napplying principles of psychology, sociology, and statistics to\nexplain phenomena occurring in the business world. Subjects\ncovering topics related to organizational behaviour, human\nresources and econometrics, began to be taught at newly opened\nbusiness schools in universities such as Harvard.\nToday, there are literally thousands of journals containing infor-\nmation on just about any issue in the field.

The marketing department strives to profoundly understand\nthe customer to develop a product or service which the customer will\nwant. Once that information is gathered, that information is trans-\nferred to the business, which in turn produces a product according\nto those specifications. Once a product has been created, the\nmarketing department is responsible for communicating to the\nconsumer the benefits of the product, and points out how their\nproduct differs from the competition. For example, walk into any\ngrocery store and pay close attention to the different brands of\npasta sauces. Not only can you buy plain tomato sauce, you can buy\nvarieties blended with peppers, mushrooms or a m\u00e9lange of herbs.\nEach variant offers the consumer something the others do not.\nEmphasizing the differences between choices and the value the\nconsumer will receive is the essence of marketing. Of course, the\nvalue received goes beyond the physical product. It includes the\nmeaning of the product\u2019s brand.

In the introduction we\ndefined management as a set of activities to help an organization\nrealize a stated goal by maximizing limited resources. Following that\ndefinition we define marketing management as the administering\nof the process of satisfying consumer needs while ensuring the\ncompany makes a profit.\nMarketing has two aims. The first is to attract new customers by\nhighlighting the potential value a good or service offers a consumer.\nGetting customers is an active process, the business must solicit the\ncustomer. Rarely do customers come to a business.\nThe second aim of marketing is to retain customers by continu-\nally meeting and surpassing the customer\u2019s satisfaction with the\nproduct .Researchers have found that often as much as 80% of a\ncompany\u2019s revenue accrues from as few as 20% of a company\u2019s\nrepeat customers. The luxury car manufacturer Lexus estimated the\nlifetime value of a satisfied customer was worth $1.17 million, or\nroughly 20 times the retail price of one car. The reasons being were\nthat profit was accrued not from the sale of the car itself, but from\nthe sale of spare parts and maintenance checks.\nHowever, unless Toyota (the makers of Lexus) has managed to\nhide from securities regulators they are a majority shareholder in a\nmajor oil company, the cost of spare parts and maintenance checks\ndo not add up to $1.17 million. How did Lexus come up with a\nfigure so high? It turns out that satisfied customers are also likely\nto tell their friends how pleased they are with a product, a social\nphenomenon called wordofmouthmarketing. One of the para-\ndoxes of urban centres is that though there\u2019s a large concentration\nof diverse groups, individuals living in cities tend to associate them-\nselves only with people of a similar ilk; the person that can afford a\nLexus is likely to know other people with similar incomes and\ntastes. And despite how much influence advertisers like to think\nthey wield over customers, a personal endorsement plays a much\nlarger role in a purchasing decision than any slick marketing\ncampaign. J ust take a look at Google as proof. With no formal adver-\ntising whatsoever, other than encouraging users to \u201cspread the\nword\u201d, their company has grown from a tiny start-up to the market\nleader in Internet search engines. For Lexus, the power of a glowing\nrecommendation is literally worth a million dollars.WHAT IS MARKETING MANAGEMENT? 9", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2504, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93d303f2-f4cc-48ca-bb63-53379f77218f": {"__data__": {"id_": "93d303f2-f4cc-48ca-bb63-53379f77218f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abfb38de-38c6-4440-9e31-d8ea7d943229", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "f37ab8a346bf353dd59da2897cc264fac5014142dd467d6a8c74cb545a379c77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "148fc335-9ffe-478b-b5b7-6bb1756d1c4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "570a5e76f406d28dd31e5024adc912a6df4d8dcae30c84257f1d7912d1b535ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2ce4c94-74dc-4110-8870-74b7104f46dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac992ea45e7aa69dc58dd69fb76be6c12bd79a9364ae828ef49ea00e48e3519b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF MARKETING\nThe fundamental principle underlying marketing theory is that\nthroughout the course of a day, humans instinctually seek to satisfy\ntheir intrinsic needs. Needs can be classified into three groups:\nphysical, social or individual. Physical needs include food, shelter,\nand security. Social needs include a desire for companionship or\nacceptance within a group. Finally, self-expression and desire for\nknowledge are types of individual needs.\nTo satisfy these needs, humans must consume. Though the desire\nto satisfy unmet needs is instinctual, the items or actions chosen to\nsatisfy those needs are not motivated by carnal impulses. On the\ncontrary, the choices a person makes, called wants, are influenced by\ncultural and personal experiences. For example, if you live in East\nAsia, eating rice for breakfast is commonplace. In Western Europe\nand North America, however, a typical breakfast entails eating a\ngrain or corn-based cereal. Wants steer purchasing decisions.\nSince humans have the same needs but different wants, it opens\nup the possibility for many products to exist. But how does a\ncompany determine the extent of the variation? The process is\ncalled marketsegmentation.\nMarket segmentation entails taking a population and dividing\nthem into groups according to a set of shared characteristics. In\norder to create these groups, marketresearchis needed to identify\nthe characteristics that the segment shares. Market research is the\nplanned, systematic collection and analysis of data used by\nmanagers to make a decision. Market research provides information\non a customer\u2019s preferences, their buying habits, their attitudes,\nlikes and needs. Furthermore, market research reveals the potential\nsize and purchasing power of the segment.\nAn example of segmentation is what drug firm, Pfizer, is now\ndoing. In the past they used sales reps to call regularly on physicians\nto inform them about new types of therapies. However, Pfizer no\nlonger treats all physicians alike, research revealed that many physi-\ncians did not appreciate sales reps taking up their already limited\ntime. Physicians much prefer to evaluate information while attending\nseminars or during their spare time reading information published\non the Internet. As such, Pfizer responded by segmenting physicians\naccording to how they like to be communicated to. By doing so, Pfizer\ncould better allocate their resources to the needs of each group.WHAT IS MARKETING MANAGEMENT?10", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2ce4c94-74dc-4110-8870-74b7104f46dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2ce4c94-74dc-4110-8870-74b7104f46dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "763c0d77-1bd0-499c-a7f8-6ec2241ca2e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "b000cc5fcc247ac51c0170e1cb7701169bfbf5e546031887577dca52d2f0e57b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "93d303f2-f4cc-48ca-bb63-53379f77218f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "f37ab8a346bf353dd59da2897cc264fac5014142dd467d6a8c74cb545a379c77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "539d431c-8d03-4954-9cdc-d58f48f72d07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5f3f1572f663638d59af46c22886a327ada1e285667029b7affb2769b78ed36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Segmenting the market allows the marketer to identify which\ngroup or groups they believe are the most attractive. For any\nmarket there are many potential segments, one of the great chal-\nlenges of marketing is carefully choosing a small number of segments\non which to focus your limited resources. Learning to say no to\nopportunities is a difficult thing for many marketers to do! Even a\ngiant like IBM has only finite resources and must carefully align\nthem to the markets for which it has best advantages over their\ncompetitors. The segment(s) the firm decides to market their product\nto is called the targetmarket. It is the target market that is exposed\nto a variety of carefully calibrated marketing strategies, what we\ncall the five Ps (product, place, price, promotion and people).\nTogether, the strategies chosen for the 5 Ps is known as the marketing\nmix. We will discuss market segmentation, and the marketing mix\nin further detail in chapters 3 through 6.\nTHE EIGHT STATES OF DEMAND\nWhen individuals seek to buy a product to satisfy a need, they\ncreate demand . The definition of demand in marketing is the same\nas that used by economists. Demand is call or desire for a particular\nproduct the consumer wants to satisfy their needs. Economists\nassume that market demand can be aggregated, and represented on\na chart using one downward sloping line. Philip Kotler, regarded as\none of the most influential researchers in marketing, found that\nmarket demand is not so neatly linear. His research proved that\nmarket demand for a product actually has different states, and the\nstate in which the market is in, in turn, determines the profitability\nof the product. Skilled marketers seek to influence the concentra-\ntion, timing and type of demand.\n1 NEGATIVE DEMAND\nNegative demand arises when the targeted market dislikes the\nproduct offered. They actively avoid it, and actively dissuade others\nfrom consuming it.

Years of bad press and\nprotests by social welfare groups started to affect shoe sales, causing\nNike to start forcing their suppliers to allow independent inspectors\naudit the conditions of the sweatshops.\n2 NO DEMAND\nDuring a period of no-demand, a customer is unaware of the\nproduct or is disinterested. This type of demand is commonplace\nfor new products that serve a need or want that the customer is\nunaware can be satisfied. Many call this situation a \u201ca solution\nlooking for a problem.\u201d To overcome this critical issue, the producer\nmust continue to tweak the product in search of the \u201ckiller applica-\ntion\u201d that satisfied the need. A good example is the 3G cellphone.\nDespite the widespread popularity of earlier versions of cellphones,\nmanufacturers of the third generation, or \u201c3G\u201d phones as they were\ncalled, found themselves in a state of no demand; the 3G phone\noffered much better sound quality and reliability, however when it\nwas released, the market hadn\u2019t fully absorbed the 2G version yet.\nWhen consumers were faced with the choice between the two, they\nwouldn\u2019t justify paying the extra expense. Sales of 3G took off once\nmanufacturers started adding such features as downloadable ring-\ntones, a digital camera and other items to personalise the phone.\nThese features helped to create tangible differences between the 2G\nand 3G phone. Products are technology-driven. Markets are time-\ndriven. Markets need time to understand what possibilities exist\nwith new technology.\n3 LATENT DEMAND\nA market is in a period of latent demand when existing products fail\nto completely satisfy customer need. This occurs due to a variety of\nreasons: it is not economically feasible, the technology hasn\u2019t been\ninvented yet, the producer misunderstands their customer, or the\ncustomer cannot express their need clearly. Producers actively scan\nthe economy for markets with latent demand. They are extremely\nattractive because there are willing buyers.

Although there are many warning signs a market is experi-\nencing declining demand, even the world's best marketers can miss\nthe early indicators. In 2003, McDonald\u2019s announced their first loss\nin their corporate history. Management didn\u2019t understand that\nconsumers were extremely concerned about reducing their caloric\nintake. Obesity levels in the Western world have skyrocketed over\nthe last two decades. As a consequence, McDonald\u2019s loyal customers\nincreasingly chose to eat lower caloric but healthier foods such as\nsalads, and low-carbohydrate foods, items that were not as prof-\nitable as their fried food options. What\u2019s more, many customers\nstopped visiting altogether because they were fed up with persistent\nrequests to supersize their portion. Supersizing is a profitable prac-\ntice for a restaurant. It is a selling strategy that entails suggesting to\na client to choose a larger portion size for a proportionately smaller\nincrease in cost. The restaurant benefits because they fatten their\nmargin, and the customer benefits because they feel they\u2019re getting\nmore value for their money. Morgan Spurlock's 2004 movie\nSupersize Me detailed this practice quite poignantly.\nDuring times of declining demand, marketers must uncover the\nroots of the malaise and refocus the marketing mix.

For example department stores continually lose money\nuntil the Christmas season, which is where the bulk of the profits\nare made and the other 11 months of operation is paid for.

Sales are the life and death of a company\u2019s fortunes.\nUnderstanding which market forces drive their respective market\nand how to stimulate demand using various tools and strategies is\nan essential skill. Secondly, a marketing manager is a communi cator.\nThey interact with customers to inform them about the benefits a\nproduct offers. Everything from advertisements to the labelling on\nthe package sends a message to the customer of the benefits that\nreside within. At the same time, the marketing manager listens to\ncustomers to understand which needs are not being satisfied. In the\nlong-term it is the customer who drives market dynamics.

Companies\nthat adopt the product concept, focus their efforts on maximizing\nthe available economies of scale. This focus entails improving the\nefficiency of production and distribution lines.\nThis strategy succeeds if two conditions are met: The manufac-\nturer is not the distributor and market demand exceeds supply. The\nshortage pushes prices higher at the retail level, providing the\nmanufacturer with an incentive to increase operational efficiencies\nor expand their operations should the excess demand persist.\nThe production concept is also applicable in situations where the\nprice exceeds what the targeted market is willing to pay. Most people\ndesire cars that minimize the amount of pollutants emitted into the\nair. However, not everyone can afford the $60,000 price tag. If produc-\ntion costs are lower, the price of the car will follow in tandem.\nFirms using the production concept run the risk of succumbing\nto marketing myopia if by continually focusing on improving theirWHAT IS MARKETING MANAGEMENT? 17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2221, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a29486ce-08fa-4946-8509-cc1d6f76c4ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "a29486ce-08fa-4946-8509-cc1d6f76c4ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29c8ee0d-16af-433d-9054-56d13347269a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "2992c7da1153b1ebd3158bb980360e3b45a2ce6d7ba07552ce011a562aa99d55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24ad2b56-801e-435e-9bf7-39ef24151b2f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "af642413e615478100a8ef6f35fa6f1dfb04645694af647319097a8b2fcca224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6ac7efe-71e1-464c-b35b-38e9fc7e8565", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2928fea875dc5828e3244372530653eed1f0e57b0503012643fae9c111667f2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "operations internally they start to neglect the real objective of\nselling, which is to satisfy their customer\u2019s needs.\nTHE PRODUCT CONCEPT\nFirms adopting the product concept believe consumers favour prod-\nucts that offer the most value after considering the quality, and\nperformance of the product.

Strategic planning is a\nprocess of developing and maintaining a plan of action that coordi-\nnates the activities of every business unit to ensure the long-term\ngoals of an organization are fulfilled. Over the course of a strategic\nplanning session, a strategicplanemerges. The strategic plan is both\na sermon and a pulpit. It clearly states the company\u2019s goals, and\nexplains the sequence of events in how they will achieve their\nobjectives. Once the strategic direction is set it is up to the various\nunits to figure out how to creatively deliver the required results.\nTHE MISSION STATEMENT\nA strategic plan starts with a missionstatement. The mission state-\nment explains in general terms the organization\u2019s goals and their\nraison d\u2019etre or purpose.

We aim for people to\ncommunicate with friends, families, and colleagues more flexibly,\nmore cost effectively, and with better sound quality than ever previ-\nously imagined.\nStudies have shown that well-crafted mission statements have three\ncharacteristics. They first focus on a limited number of goals that\nare challenging yet realistic. Second, mission statements explain the\npolicies and values of the company. Third, they state which markets\nthe company is targeting.

The managers at the business unit level develop the strate-\ngies to achieve the goals and provide guidelines and profit targets to\nmanagers at the product level, who develop and implement the\nprograms to meet the overall corporate objectives.\nTHE CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN\nThe aim of the corporate plan is to provide managers at every level\nof the organization with a framework which captures the current\nstate of the market(s) they operate within.\nBUSINESS CYCLES\nIn helping to build your corporate and business strategy going\nforward you need to understand the bigger economic picture.\nKnowing where you and your customers are in the business cycle is\nimportant. One of the features of a market economy is that if you\nplot the growth of output over a long period of time, what emerges\nis a graph that is marked by periods of relatively rapid growth\nfollowed by a period of decline of output. While these peaks and\nvalleys can persist for years, the average of these values would be\npositive. A businesscycleis the time between peak-to-peak or\nvalley-to-valley. Some key indicators of the state of the economy\ninclude increases in productivity, consumer confidence, gross\ndomesticproduct(GDP) and employment levels. Assuming your\ncompany\u2019s fortunes are closely tied to the state of the economy, the\nmore positive news relative to the past suggests the market would\nbe receptive to growth strategies. If the news was pessimistic, a\ncautious approach is appropriate.\nBeyond the bigger macroeconomic picture it is very helpful to\nunderstand the industry you are competing in and its dynamics.\nOne of the most popular models of understanding your firm\u2019s\nindustry is the Five Forces Model devised by Harvard Business\nProfessor Michael Porter.

K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel first intro-\nduced the concept of core competencies in 1990. They argue that\nfirms should carefully consider the historical success of their firm\nto understand what they are world-class at and use these experiences,\nabilities or competencies as a launching pad for future products and\nmarket forays. An example they cite is Japanese automotive giant\nHonda. One of their core competencies is manufacturing high\nquality yet inexpensive engines. By tweaking the design, Honda\nwas able to exploit their core competency in engine manufacturing,\nto move into other product categories that also used motorized\nengines such as lawn mowers, motorcycles and snow blowers \u2013\ncategories of product which did not very often share the same\ncustomers. By harnessing core competencies, a company can leap\ninto seemingly distant product categories.\nCore competencies that endure over a long period of time\ncreate a sustainedcompetitiveadvantage. They called the plane\nthe 747. When they introduced the plane in 1970, it was the only\nlong-distance aircraft manufacturer that could carry over 450\npassengers. For another company to build a suitable alternative,\nthey would have to have invested billions in research and devel-\nopment. Until various European governments agreed to use\ntaxpayer funds to create Airbus, Boeing was the only company\nthat could build cost-effective long-haul aeroplanes. Their virtual\nmonopoly lasted almost 35 years.\nASSIGNING RESOURCES TO SBUS\nAs we mentioned earlier, senior management devises a corporate\nstrategic plan and assigns resources to each SBU taking into account\nthe state of the economy. When it comes to allocating resources,\nmanagers must contend with the problem of scarcity. To overcome\nthis problem, SBUs are evaluated in a similar manner to how one\nwould evaluate their investment portfolio. However there is a twist.\nWhen evaluating one\u2019s personal investments, the majority of funds\nare placed in high performing assets, and some funds are diverted to\nsafe investments to offset the risk. When it comes to allocating\nresources to SBUs a problem emerges. An investor can easily liqui-\ndate a bad investment. Business assets cannot be dispensed as\nquickly. One wrong move ties up resources for a long time.

SBUs with high market share and high growth are called\n\u201cstars\u201d; the \u201ccash cows\u201d are SBUs with high market share but low\ngrowth; SBUs with low market share and low growth are called\ndogs. Finally, SBUs with growth rates but low market share are\ncalled \u201cquestion marks\u201d.\nUsing the BCG technique, managers quickly assess which SBUs\nare growing rapidly (stars), which SBUs could be milked to finance\nthe growth (cash cows), and which SBUs to divest (dogs). Question\nmarks have the potential of being turned into stars, but they\nrequire development through increased funding and resources.\nWith this model, managers can create a pecking order as to who\nreceives funding first.\nBesides being used as a tool to allocate funding to SBUs, compa-\nnies use the model to aide in product-line decisions. Cellphone\nmanufacturer Ericsson for example, plots the market performance\nof their 2G and 3G product-lines. Over time, the 2G phones moved\nfrom being a star to a cash cow and eventually a dog. Doing this\nallows them to change funding levels by timing critical decisions\nbetter. However, when analysing at a product level, the manager\nmustn\u2019t make the mistake of assuming all markets are alike. As we\nsaid earlier, products are technology driven, markets are time\ndriven. If a product is a dog in one market, it could still be a cash\ncow in another.\nModels such as the BCG approach have its fair share of critics.\nThey contend that using such an approach tempts managers to\nbelieve that using a simple and elegant model solves all of the prob-\nlems related to resource allocation. Furthermore, it assumes SBUs\nare completely independent entities. In practice that is rarely the\ncase. SBUs share resources, capabilities, personnel and facilities.\nDivesting dogs that offer synergies introduces the danger of\nadversely affecting well performing SBUs. Furthermore, the results\nof the model are sensitive to the assigned weights and ratings.

The sales curve of a product over\ntime also exhibits the same characteristics, though marketers prefer\nto label the four stages as introduction, growth, maturity and\ndecline. This sequence is known as the productlife-cycle. Figure 2.2\nillustrates a typical product life-cycle. On the horizontal axis is the\nlength of time the product is on the market, while on the vertical\naxis is sales revenue. As the figure shows, typically revenue for a\nproduct follows an elongated \u201cS\u201d shape curve over its lifetime.\nA product\u2019s \u201clife\u201d begins with its introduction to the market-\nplace. Sales volume is low, and losses are registered since all the\ncosts associated with developing and bringing the product to market\nare borne. Resources are spent promoting the product to increase its\nvisibility. This is most critical time in a product\u2019s life, most new\nproducts fail and die off early. The job of the marketer is clear, to\nwork very hard to get the product past the critical early days and\nsuccessfully to the growth stage.\nAt the heart of this effort is to understand how and why people\nadopt new products, services or ideas. In any population, whether it\nbe as broad as Germans who drink beer to as narrow as dentists in\nMelbourne, most people don\u2019t like change and don\u2019t like to try new\nthings. Thankfully for marketers there are exceptions. There is a\nsmall percentage, generally taken as about 2.5% whom are vision-\naries or innovators who are willing to try out a new thing without\nevidence that anyone else has; these are people who don\u2019t look\naround to see who else is using the new product but are willing to\nbuy on their feelings and intuition.

The concepts we have been\ncovering thus far in this chapter are firmly based in marketing\ntoday and will undoubtedly be useful for many years to come.

In some cases a product can enjoy what is called a \u201cscal-\nloped\u201d life-cycle with new growth taking place during the decline\nstage bringing new life to a moribund product.

There are few things we can say with confidence, or at least\nsome confidence, about the future. One of those few for us is that\nwe are in the midst of a massive move to an experience economy.\nFor much of the 19th century the west\u2019s economy was domi-\nnated by an extraction or commodities economy. Starting in the late\n18th century the British started the Industrial Revolution and were\nthe dominant manufacturing power during that century, though\nFrance, Germany and the US also had important parts to play. At its\npeak Britain was manufacturing over 50% of the finished products\nin world trade. Much of the rest of the world was left behind; even\nthe US was still dominated by agriculture and other commodity\nbusinesses. Starting in the early 20th century but especially after\nWorld War II, manufacturing became more central.\nSince the 1970s we have seen a dramatic shift to a services\neconomy.

It is easy to say whether you are in manu-\nfacturing or services. Being firmly in the experience economy means\nthat you are also part of the services economy.

Note, at this point, that only\na portion will view your offering this way.\nWhat we see in North America, Western Europe and Japan is a\nbifurcating of consumer behaviour. The same consumer is shopping at\nboth Wal-Mart and Nordstrom\u2019s. On one hand, they want the cheap\nand cheerful offer of Wal-Mart for a substantial portion of their\nspending.

However, the fascinating thing\nis that it is also creeping into the other, more mundane, categories\nas well. Of course, which category your product fits into depends not\nso much on your product as on the individual shopper\u2019s view of it.\nThe challenge that marketers are facing who are not the\nTakashimaya or Four Seasons or Saks Fifth Avenues of the world is\nhow do we integrate a great experience at a more sensible price\npoint?

In\nwhich circumstances should dogs be kept in the portfolio?\n2 According to some studies, the number of children classi-\nfied as obese is well over 30%. Knowing that there are\ninnovators, early adopters and other types of people,\ndevise a list of strategies that you think would combat the\nproblem of obesity. Next, assess which ideas are likely to\ndiffuse into the general population? Is there a role for\ngovernment to play in the equation?

The matrix in turn provides a platform in which to\nevaluate the performance of a dimension in relation to another\ndimension, or in relation to the entire portfolio. To conduct this\nanalysis, managers must assess the performance of each product\nwithin each dimension. These tests indicate which products need to\nbe built, maintained, harvested or divested in order to meet the\ncorporate objective.

A high turnover ratio is a sign\nthat the company is producing and selling its goods or services very\nquickly. Most distributors who have 20%\u201330% gross margins\nstrive to achieve an overall turnover rate of five to six turns per\nyear. One of the secrets to Dell\u2019s success versus its former\ncompetitor Compaq (now part of high-tech giant HP) is that Dell\nhad twice the inventory turnover as Compaq.\nRETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI)\nROI is a very common tool used to measure the return on an\ninvestment.

Positive ROI means the product is\ncreating shareholder value. ROI is one of the most popular tools\nused by managers today because of the powerful conclusions one\ncan make using a simple formula.\nInterestingly, the above formula misleads how much value was\ndestroyed if an investment soured. Let us suppose the initial invest-\nment was $100 and the investment yielded a 10% return. That\nwould result in an overall return of $110. However, if the same\ninvestment yielded a return of -10%, the return would be $99 not\n$90 as expected.\nRETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC)\nReturn on capital is also known as Return On Invested Capital\n(ROIC). It is defined as the net income on an investment divided by\nthe capital invested in the project. Some managers include\nborrowing costs in their calculation of ROC. When the ROC is\nhigher than the company\u2019s costofcapital, then the company is\ncreating value to the shareholders.\nPRODUCT LEVEL STRATEGIES\nHaving discussed some of the tests managers use to assess the\nperformance of a product, these numbers need to be placed within a\ncorporate strategy perspective. The numbers can declare if a product\nis performing exceptionally, however, if that product is succeeding\nin a mature market, those results are likely to be attributed to other\nplayers exiting the market. To succeed in the long-term, the\ncompany must change their product mix over time. The next\nsection discusses a number of strategies at a firm\u2019s disposal to\nchange the product mix. For many firms they have rules of thumb\nthat a certain percentage (say 50%) of sales must come from prod-\nucts less than 5 years in the market, in high-tech markets they\nwould often use a benchmark of 2 years rather than 5 years.\nPRODUCT-FILLING\nProduct-fillingis a strategy whereby the vendor offers the same\nproducts in different shapes, sizes, qualities or prices.

Pharmaceutical companies frequently stretch their\nproduct-line to capture market share. For example, for each brand of\npainkillers they offer, users can purchase a product of varying\nstrength, method of consumption (pill or gel-cap), and length of\neffectiveness.\nBy offering a wide variety of products under one brand, product-\nlining offers a low-cost, low-risk way to meet unsatisfied buyer\nneeds. What\u2019s more, by extending a product-line, the vendor\u2019s\nbargaining power with retailers increases because the vendor accounts\nfor a higher percentage of the retailer\u2019s total sales. Other strategic\nadvantages include blocking entry opportunities for competitors,\nraising the entry price for competitors, and utilizing excess capacity.\nFrom a competitive perspective, product-filling poses a real\nproblem. Smaller firms and foreign firms trying to break into the\nshelves of large retailers cannot do so because the shelves are domi-\nnated by existing competitors.\nLine-filling can be detrimental to a business as well. By offering\nmore items in a product-line, the practice could result in self-\ncannibalization. Self-cannibalization is the reduction in volume,\nrevenue or market share of one product as a result of the introduc tion\nof another product by the same producer. Some analysts believe the\nintroduction of the iPod Mini will hurt future profits at Apple.\nLINE-STRETCHING\nLine-stretchingentails lengthening the product-line by offering\nproducts to potential customers residing upstream and/or down-\nstream. Firms engage in line-stretching because they are striving to\nbecome a full-line vendor, they are chasing higher margins or\ngrowth or they are doing so for tactical reasons.

However, if the right channels are chosen, the distri-\nbution system becomes a source of competitive advantage because\nthe seller has privileged access to their target markets.\nFor the remainder of this chapter, we inspect the ins and outs of\nplacement.

Traditionally, the\nsupply chain has been regarded as a linear process: raw materials\nare extracted and refined, then sent to a manufacturing plant\nwhere it is machined into a product, then the product is either sold\nto the consumer directly or through a series of intermediaries. In\nthis \u201cmake and sell\u201d perspective, there is little to no coordination\nin the supply chain between members that are not adjacent to each\nother in the process. Coordinating structural, technological,\ncontractual and behavioural issues in the entire system is problem-\natic to say the least. Because of such difficulties, historically,\nproduct offerings were not built according to customer need, but\nrather on maximizing short-term profits based on the production\nor distribution capabilities of the upstream and downstream\nparties.\nMarketers believe that a linear supply chain perspective should\nbe bent into a shape more reflective of the business environment.\nConceptually, regarding the supply chain as a process in which a\nresource undergoes a series of transformations is true, but such a\nperspective fails to capture the underlying dynamics driving thePRODUCT AND PLACEMENT46", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2226, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3813006b-cd8f-448a-8f9a-4b9f8b027474": {"__data__": {"id_": "3813006b-cd8f-448a-8f9a-4b9f8b027474", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aaf50e15-e459-434b-9d3e-126e91dd6740", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "ef7e66a79c8cd1204f0df853160ab606db8160c2d4636dd5489fb49bee2bbb82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "930a59d1-c92f-49a9-8ab1-8f7528281496", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "3381d0b05c7fc2b72e82ea4b4e93fe6f797cbadd4771b006a4d1f9e5ac41ace8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d4ca532-3302-4945-8293-14c998a0aaa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70c97c11e4a212609701f68bb0d4d1048eb5e96f8557ab4005fcbe132ad4a168", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "system. Business processes are better represented by flows of infor-\nmation, cash, people, and physical products moving in, out and\nbetween the various members of the marketing channel. These\nflows create complex behavioural systems, which in turn affect\nindividuals, departments, companies, and even economies.\nCustomer value is created when the needs and wants of the\ncustomer are satisfied. Those firms that create partnerships to best\nalign these flows to improve the performance of the system, create\nwhat is known as a valuenetwork. Value networks are more effi-\ncient than linear supply chains because every aspect of the system\nis aligned to the purpose of creating customer value, not maxi-\nmizing short-term profit.\nTHE VALUE NETWORK\nA value network is a system of interdependent organizations\nneeded to source, support, and deliver a product that provides\ncustomers with the highest level of value. Upstream, suppliers offer\nvalue by guaranteeing the quality and time of delivery of the\nproduct. Downstream, intermediaries act as marketing channels to\nthe targeted customer. A value network offers many advantages.\nThe first is that it increases specialization. Since each company is\nguaranteed a source of supply, each firm can concentrate on those\nactivities which they do best. The second advantage is that it allows\nevery member of the network to become aware of disturbances in\nthe supply chain much more quickly. If problems arise upstream or\ndownstream, all members of the network are affected, a consider-\nable incentive to ensure cooperation is used to resolve the problem.\nFinally, a value network increases the likelihood that firms will\nintegrate certain parts of their operations with adjacent partners to\nensure the network is operating smoothly. A well-managed and\nproperly designed value network decreases cost and increases effi-\nciency. What\u2019s more, by orienting a firm\u2019s operations to maximizing\ncustomer value the firm in turn becomes better at \u201csensing and\nresponding to\u201d customers needs.\nAn example of a value network is Airbus and the way it is\nmanufacturing the giant 555 passenger A 380.

Once established, a marketing channel is almost\nmollified. Given the stakes involved as a consequence of globaliza-\ntion, the question arises why would a manufacturer, particularly a\nlarge sized one, trust intermediaries to bring their product to\nmarket? Surely developing a well-functioning marketing channel is\ndifficult, but not impossible.\nLouis W. Stern and Adel I. El-Ansary offer a useful explanation\nas to why a producer would rely on an intermediary:\nIntermediaries smooth the flow of goods and services . . . This proce-\ndure is necessary in order to bridge the discrepancy between the\nassortment of goods and services generated by the producer and the\nassortment of demanded by the consumer. The discrepancy results\nfrom the fact that manufacturers typically produce a large quantity of a\nlimited variety of goods, whereas consumers usually desire only a\nlimited quantity of a wide variety of goods.\nConsumers want convenience and variety. The cost to reach a crit-\nical mass of customers is simply too high to justify creating a\nproprietary channel for most manufacturers. By specializing,\nproducers can concentrate on activities they\u2019re best at, which is\ndesigning, developing and manufacturing their product. Shifting\nthe responsibilities of distribution and selling, which requires\ncompetencies in logistics, warehousing, information gathering, and\na network of sales agents, is in the interest of the manufacturer\nwith production competencies. Efficiency increases; production costs\ndecreases. It is these two factors that provide economic incentives\nfor manufacturers to create relationships with intermediaries.\nIntermediaries add customer value.PRODUCT AND PLACEMENT48", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68ee9f89-4d62-4922-9050-3a71a1624fc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "68ee9f89-4d62-4922-9050-3a71a1624fc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90c1c225-62a1-4a26-8062-c4271485df85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "7055880595d795380a953df837f7fca02c60ad6bb132d63ab6aec81c1982c75b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d4ca532-3302-4945-8293-14c998a0aaa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "c291e344e36ee43708b5aa51110bd55cce4e6fffcdfde310b1983e48c3a1da92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb6b6b26-d067-4099-abc3-8806ba259a68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3c50902a7a23e44aa6bf8784c0c13227a1da0d7e0b52aa0f47304151f3491f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHANNEL LEVELS\nPreventing the producer from realizing a sale are the marketing\nchannels the product must traverse through before it reaches the\nconsumer. Some products require no intermediaries; others require\nmultiple ones.\nA zero-level channel is one where the producer is the distributor.\nMail order, and companies that sell their products on the Internet\nhave a zero-level channel; Dell is a great example of a company\nsuccessfully in doing this. ICE.com is another example; this online\nonly firm sells jewellery from Montreal around world with the US\nand the UK as the dominant markets. They believe that other\nmarkets will become more active as they get more experience\nbuying online.\nA one-level channel is where there is one intermediary, most\noften a retailer, between the customer and producer. A two-level\nchannel is where there are two intermediaries, and so on and so on.\nThe number of intermediaries profoundly affects how a product is\nmarketed. The more intermediaries means the less responsibilities \u2013\nand less cost \u2013 the manufacturer incurs. However, by outsourcing\ncontrol to other partners, the producer has less influence in how the\nproduct is marketed and distributed.

In the next section, we take a closer look at three\ntypes of marketing channels that provide the needed leadership to\nassign roles and manage disputes.\nVERTICAL MARKETING CHANNELS\nThe first type of marketing channel that provides the necessary\nleadership to assign roles and manage disputes is called a vertical\nmarketing channel. In this system, a set of producers, wholesalers,\nand retailers act in concert to maximize the returns for the collec-\ntive. In this system, channel members engage in a practice called\ncross-ownership, each member of the channel owns a percentage\nof the other partner\u2019s companies. If cross-ownership is not possible,\nor is illegal, contracts can be devised that bind the companies\ntogether, or if the market power of one company is so great, all\nmembers of the system must cooperate for fear of losing the\ncontract. Wal-Mart is an example of a company whose buying\npower is so high that the threat of exclusion is sufficient enough to\ncoerce suppliers to cooperate. In a vertical marketing channel\nsystem, the firm that assigns roles and manages conflict can be a\nproducer, wholesaler or retailer. The Japanese economy serves as a\ncautionary tale on the drawbacks of vertical marketing channels.\nMost of the Japanese economy has been organized in this manner,\nthe difference being that the lending institution (typically a bank)\nalso owns shares in each company in the vertical marketing\nchannel. Following the bursting of a real-estate bubble, economic\ngrowth has been virtually stagnant for the last 15 years.

Such instances are also called cross-\npromotion. In a cross-promotion situation, partners combine\ncapital, production capabilities and other resources towards some\ncommon promotion objective beneficial to the collective. Roles are\ndivided according to the capabilities of each firm, and proceeds are\ndivided according to an agreed upon formula. Since both firms are\ndependent on each other for success, the potential for enduring\nconflict is lessened. However, a mechanism is needed to mediate on\ncontentious issues.\nOne of the drawbacks to a horizontal marketing channel system\nis that it promotes short-term profit seeking behaviour. Solely\nfocusing on the short-term will lead to the situation where marketers\ncross-promote dissimilar products together. When two dissimilar\nproducts are cross-promoted, the marketer must take into account\nthe suitability of the two products. For example, Bob Dylan, the\nageless rock star, counter-culture promoter and shall we say, not the\nhandsomest of men, was once featured on the front cover of a\nVictoria Secret catalogue, which as many know is renowned for full\npage pictures of supermodels wearing the company\u2019s latest line of\nlingerie.

A hybrid\nmarketing channel is a distribution system whereby a single firm\ncreates more than one channel to reach one or more target markets.\nAlso known as a multichannel distribution system, hybrid marketing\nchannels are favoured by firms operating in large and complex\nmarkets. With multiple channels to their target markets, the firm\nhas more opportunities to tailor the product offering to customer\nneeds, and also expand its market coverage. These two factors\nenable the firm to gain more power, which translates into negoti-\nating power to mediate in conflict and assign roles.

As new channels develop, they will eventually compete for\nthe same customers and sales serviced by intermediaries in the\nother channels. Competing against firms that are supposed to be\npartners will lead to conflict.\nCHANNEL CONFLICT\nOne of the sources of conflict is change. In the business world,\nmarket conditions change all the time: new players enter, old\nplayers exit, new technologies emerge, etc. Conflict exists in every\nbusiness relationship. Marketing channels are no exception.\nVertical conflict occurs when the marketing channel system\nemployed is a vertical market channel system. This type of conflict\nemerges when disagreements between the manufacturer and their\nintermediary cannot be reconciled. Horizontal conflict occurs when\nfirms at the same level of the channel have conflicts with each other.\nFranchises often complain about pricing behaviour, or other activi-\nties by other franchises operating in the same geographical region.\nFinally hybrid channel conflict occurs when two or more channels\ncompete for the same market. One approach used by Unisys was to\npay commission on a sale to both channels. However they found it\nwas quite expensive and only worked for a short amount of time.\nManaging the conflict requires tact, diplomacy and a sincere\neffort at finding common ground between the different parties. If\nless formal methods fail to resolve the issue, arbitration and media-\ntion may be required to resolve long-standing disputes.\nBUILDING A MARKETING CHANNEL\nEvery company has their own methods of reaching their target\ncustomers. Because of the wide variety, we can only provide general\nguidelines on how to build and manage a marketing channel.\nSETTING CHANNEL GOALS AND CHANNEL TYPE\nThe first step is to establish the goals of the channel.

Firms then decide\nwhich markets they wish to serve, and the best available types of\nmarketing channels for reaching those segments. It is not unusual\nfor a manufacturer to employ a vertical market channel in one\nmarket and a horizontal in another; this is particularly true in\ndifferent national markets, where they may not be able to gain\naccess to a market without a local partner.\nIDENTIFYING PARTNERS\nOnce the company has defined the channel goals and selected the\nchannel type, the next step is to identify partners to act as interme-\ndiaries. Choosing a partner depends on the type of distribution\nstrategy the firm wishes to employ. One strategy, called intensive\ndistribution, grants distribution rights to every possible vendor.\nManufacturers of consumer goods employ this strategy, as it\nincreases convenience for the consumer. However, because there are\nliterally tens of thousands of partners, the marketing channel is\ncomplex and conflicts abound.\nThe complete opposite strategy is exclusivedistribution.\nManufacturers of luxury items often employ this strategy. Exclusive\ndistribution grants a limited number of intermediaries exclusive rights to\nsell a product-line. Exclusivity increases a brand\u2019s image and desir-\nability, and also allows for more control over pricing, promotion and\ncustomer service, since there is only one intermediary selling the\nproduct in the market.

If you envision a\ncontinuum, this strategy would lie in-between intensive and exclu-\nsive distribution. With a selective distribution strategy, more than\none intermediary is granted distribution rights , but not all.

In Japan, soap passes through three wholesalers before being\nshelved at a retailer. Even more dramatic is the number of levels\nrice passes through \u2013 23.\nCHANNEL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\nOnce the firm selects a partner, or a number of partners, to act as an\nintermediary between the manufacturer and the consumer, occa-\nsionally the leader must employ the different forms of channel\npowerto elicit cooperation according to their terms.\nCOERCIVE POWER\nThe manufacturer threatens to withdraw a resource or terminate a\nrelationship if intermediaries refuse to cooperate. In the short-term,\nthe manufacturer will likely force the intermediary to cooperate. In\nthe long-term however, forcing intermediaries to heel builds resent-\nment, which could lead the intermediary to pursue strategies to\nnegate that advantage.\nREWARD POWER\nReward power is a strategy which involves offering a reward to an\nintermediary for cooperation. Offering incentives is more effective\nthan coercive power, many firms use money and contests with trips\nand other awards as a way of enticing channels to sell their prod-\nucts, these are often powerful motivators.\nLEGITIMATE POWER\nEmploying legitimate power involves requesting intermediaries to\nrespect their contractual obligations.

So long as the expertise\nremains with the manufacturer, the bargaining power is high. To\npreserve expert power, the manufacturer must continue to develop\nnew products, processes or ideas that the intermediaries value. This\nis a powerful and generally well-received approach.\nREFERENT POWER\nFinally there is referent power. In this case, the manufacturer is so\nrespected by consumers, the intermediaries would face financial\nruin if they did not comply with the requests or demands of the\nmanufacturer. Manufacturers like this because power remains with\nthem and allows them to control the channel.\nPower often shifts over time as the economy and the environ-\nment changes.

Determining the right\nprice is by no means a perfect science. First of all, different\nphilosophies exist as to what constitutes a fair price. While there\nis complete agreement that the price offered must cover the cost\nof the product and return a profit to the producer to compensate\nfor the risk incurred, the difficulties arise when discussing how\nhigh the realized profit should be. Athletic shoes cost pennies to\nmake, a few dollars to advertise, and yet retail for hundreds of\ndollars. Selling shoes it seems is more profitable than distributing\nnarcotics (certainly is safer). With a such a high rate of return\nsurely, some argue, shoe manufacturers are abusing their market\npower and charging too high a price. That perspective ignores that\nconsumers will pay a premium for branded and high-quality\ngoods. As we demonstrated in the last chapter, customers like\nproducts that offer many benefits. Producers that spend resources\ndeveloping their product into a brand will realize a higher profit\nmargin, assuming the product delivers on the promises it makes to\nconsumers. One of the great challenges for marketers in this\ndecade is to keep prices up in spite of cheap imports from China,\nIndia and other countries.

The fashion industry is one\nprominent example, among many. Even the great fashion power-\nhouse of Italy, long famous for the best cloth in the world for\nmen\u2019s suits, is seeing factory after factory closed as the quality of\nChinese manufacturing continues to improve, much to China\u2019s\ncredit. What should Italian fashion marketers do? This is a diffi-\ncult question but staying on the leading edge of design, cloth and\nmanufacturing technology and thinking seems to be critical.\nBrands are undoubtedly part of the solution. This is a story for\nmarketers around the world to watch.\nIn this chapter we outline a six-step framework on how to set\nthe price of a product. Step 1 is to declare the marketing objective.\nDECLARE THE MARKETING OBJECTIVE\nThe first step to determining the price of a product is to declare its\nmarketingobjective. The marketing objective is a stated goal a\ncompany wishes to accomplish when marketing their product at a\nparticular price. By articulating the company\u2019s objectives, and the\nprocess in how they\u2019re going to achieve it, the possibilities of\nmaking a pricing error are reduced. There are five marketing objec-\ntives a company can pursue: maximize short-term profit, maximize\ncurrent market share, marketing skimming or product-quality lead-\nership or survival.\nMAXIMIZE SHORT-TERM PROFIT\nIn today\u2019s business environment stock prices incur heavy losses for\nnot meeting their expected profit targets. An unfortunate conse-\nquence of this reality is that most publicly traded firms employ a\nshort-term maximizing objective. Capital almost always flows to\nassets where returns are perceived to be the highest. Companies\nthat register results in excess of market expectations will be\nregarded as firms that create more shareholder value, which in turn\nmaintains a high stock price. To maximize short-term profits, the\nfirm must already understand the dynamics of their market.\nHaving that knowledge will assist the company in making good\npredictions as to how their customers will react to a particular price.Price 61", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2147, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50668421-22c9-4236-9b6f-11450e888916": {"__data__": {"id_": "50668421-22c9-4236-9b6f-11450e888916", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "43fcaf3c-4af7-4589-93ab-566483cdc22b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "45c485005583b8f7cc3959dd2d76b5a4372cf42699a91e9ea03f6111536e79c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7985976-968e-4eaf-8343-fa0c90525d9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "34f60574f4d4f6560747fbbde38968b7141d4ef8ba2fcf4dfe76f7a778307f59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "679c60be-74ef-4ca5-95a4-b9dd7249fa7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a084042154789d7cc2864dc99eabe52fb8aa21dad7c149c85506c3a024b4796", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Whichever price yields the highest profit, ostensibly is the price the\ncompany charges.\nMaximizing current profits may allay the concerns of institu-\ntional shareholders but in emphasizing short-term profit, the\ncompany runs the risk of sacrificing long-term profits. Higher\nprices make substitutes more attractive. Another drawback to this\nstrategy is that high profit levels encourage competitors to enter\nthe market, forcing the company to split the earnings with the\nnew entrants. What\u2019s more, demand is difficult to predict accu-\nrately. If a firm that pursues this strategy over-estimates demand,\nand realizes they\u2019re going to miss their profit targets, cost-cutting\nmeasures follow. The casualties of cutbacks are always research\nand development budgets, training programs and labour enrol-\nment levels, which ironically are the source of future corporate\nrevenue. Many firms in an effort to punch up this quarter\u2019s or\nyear\u2019s results will scrimp on marketing budgets, this is most often\nthe exact wrong thing to do if you are trying to build brand and\ncustomer loyalty.\nMAXIMIZE CURRENT MARKET SHARE\nTo accomplish this objective, which is sometimes called market-\npenetration pricing, the corporation sets out to price their product\nsuch that they capture the highest amount of market share. Pricing\nlow is an effective means of entering into a new market and\nbuilding volume. The higher the volume, the lower per unit cost\nwhich eventually leads to a higher long-term profit. This objective\nis most successful in markets that are highly sensitive to price\nchanges and require large-scale operations. Japanese firms had often\nused this approach in the past in order to gain market share in a\ncountry; they take a loss today in order to be in a much better posi-\ntion in a few years. Japan\u2019s more patient capital is very helpful in\nthat it is willing to wait for these long-term results. You may also\ntake this approach if you fear a fastfollower, that is a competitor\nwhich will quickly jump into the market after they hear of your\nsuccess. By quickly capturing market share you make it tougher for\nthem to earn a number two position.\nThe drawback of a maximizing the current market share strategy\nis while a low price is great for consumers, short-term profit levelsPrice62", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2281, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "679c60be-74ef-4ca5-95a4-b9dd7249fa7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "679c60be-74ef-4ca5-95a4-b9dd7249fa7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c579e957-0711-473b-b3d2-ea2537721958", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "377f7e9ce8597326ea011ed99862af5f7572708ff10f5aa6282bc8116f494707", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50668421-22c9-4236-9b6f-11450e888916", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "45c485005583b8f7cc3959dd2d76b5a4372cf42699a91e9ea03f6111536e79c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "354d8456-7d92-4de6-b1e5-8be050e8d534", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f00bc7a989b627b23c5d82d0616908d2aebfd776db0a46bc1e0fa3196fb622b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "get hit. Unless costs are declining as volume increases, investors will\ntolerate stock prices for only so long. Worse still, deliberately\nkeeping the price at a low level for extended periods of time creates\na perception that the price should be always low, making it difficult\nto raise prices in the long-term. Such a strategy is also illegal in\nsome markets. In markets where it takes years to start an operation\n(for example building an oil refinery), dumpinga large supply of a\nproduct to reduce the market price and force other competitors to\nexit bears severe financial and in extreme cases, even criminal\npenalties.\nMARKET SKIMMING\nAggressively entering a market with a low price to realize scale\neconomies and build market share is not an appropriate strategy for\nproducts with high start-up costs and low demand much like many\nhigh-technology products. Instead manufacturers price their\nproduct in such a way that they \u201cskim\u201d those who are willing to\npay the highest price first, and slowly reduce the price as the high\npayers market is exhausted. These high payers are often firms or\npeople for whom the solution you offer is a \u201cGod send\u201d, your\nproduct fills a need which is quite important to them and could not\nbe met, or as easily met, before. Such customers are what econo-\nmists call price insensitive, that is they will pay a lot. Some\npharmaceutical products are priced in this way. If the new drug will\nsave your life or that of a loved one you tend to be less concerned\nabout cost and more about just getting the product. Morality does\nnot interfere with profit it seems.\nHigh prices for cutting edge technology often create a buzzin\nthe media and among the user community, and for those who can\nafford to purchase the item, a chance to earn social prestige. For the\nproducer, the high price allows the firm to recoup their costs faster.\nOver time, the price is reduced and is marketed to the masses. Some\ntextbooks call price skimming \u201criding down the demand curve\u201d .Of\ncourse, all good things must come to an end and this phase only\nlasts so long. The main thing that happens is that competitors rear\ntheir ugly heads. In our economic system, profit is the \u201cblood in the\nwater\u201d to the sharks of capitalism; as soon as they see it they\nquickly are drawn to get their fair share.Price 63", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2306, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "354d8456-7d92-4de6-b1e5-8be050e8d534": {"__data__": {"id_": "354d8456-7d92-4de6-b1e5-8be050e8d534", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2133f318-701d-4228-9d8c-9b3253255f0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "7b9ba7e04f7afa40940fc5cbefd79fa0ce784c493de176923212539837891a13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "679c60be-74ef-4ca5-95a4-b9dd7249fa7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "377f7e9ce8597326ea011ed99862af5f7572708ff10f5aa6282bc8116f494707", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "698c1023-c2bd-4bf0-8b1c-d9f4e81be8e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2be78bb5840028fa3a476402211b44976dd0743810c39b3a505bbd0d4c1b5465", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PRODUCT-QUALITY LEADERSHIP\nFirms that choose a product-quality strategy aim to become the\ninnovator of the industry and offer products of the highest quality.\nThose that deliver on these two fronts, can use those features as\npart of their branding strategy, enabling them to charge a higher\nprice than their competition. IBM takes this position often, not\nbeing on the \u201ccutting edge\u201d of technology but close to it, offering\nvery innovative products with high quality. Part of IBM\u2019s offer to\nthe market is that if you buy IBM you will get technology which is\nleading edge and works, unlike some of it\u2019s competitors. HP is not\ndissimilar, when you buy a HP laser or ink jet printer it works. Big\nplayers like these can often use FUD, or fear, uncertainty and doubt,\nin their sales efforts. They will make the customer wonder about\nbuying from a smaller firm, will they be around in five years to\nsupport their product or will it be a technological orphan? Does the\nsmaller firm have the potential to make their product a market\nstandard? Otherwise, the customer will find it hard to hire people\nwho know how to program for the system or run it. This is a key\nadvantage of being a big player in an industry. The advantage of the\nlittle guy can be summarized in this one question, do you, Ms.\nCustomer, want to be a number? Here at our small firm (OSF) you\nare important to us, you matter and everyone of us, up to and\nincluding the president will return your calls and make sure you\nget everything you need.

Of\ncourse, big or small you try to take advantage of whatever strengths\nyour size or position offers you.\nSURVIVAL\nCompanies pursuing survival as their strategy signals to the market\nthat their firm is in trouble. When companies employ this strategy,\nthe price is set just above the variable cost of production, ensuring\nthe firm will remain operational.

Within a few weeks prices for air\ntravel in Canada soared, going up over 30% according to some\nanalysts, and allowing Air Canada to have a great third quarter.\nDETERMINE DEMAND AND SUPPLY\nOnce management declares the marketing objective of the product,\nthe next step is to estimate the expected demand. Because no one\ncan accurately predict the future correctly all the time, estimating\nmarket demand is more an art than a science. Statistical tools and\nmethodologies greatly aid the decision making process, a seasoned\nmanager however, knows when to go with their gut despite what\nthe numbers may suggest. Under normal economic circumstances,\nrelying on intuition is unnecessary because the relationship between\nprice and quantity sold is usually inversely proportional; the higher\nthe price, the lower the demand. Conversely, the lower the price, the\nhigher the demand. This relationship can be illustrated by a demand\ncurve. Before we delve into how to predict demand, we must first\ndiscuss issues related to supply.\nSUPPLY SHORTAGES\nThe supply of a product creates exceptions to the demand-price\nrelationship. When there\u2019s a shortage of a product, and demand is\nunchanged, the mechanism that balances the market is a higher\nprice. If the supply shortage persists, a higher price increases\ndemand, since buyers believe it is better to have the product in their\nhands today while supplies last. Currently there\u2019s a supply shortage\nin cocoa, the main ingredient used to make chocolate. Since 2003,\nthe Ivory Coast, which produces 40% of the world\u2019s cocoa has been\nin a state of civil unrest.

Luxury goods are products that are relatively price\ninsensitive meaning demand doesn\u2019t fall as much as the price\nincreases. As such if there\u2019s too much supply of a luxury good,\nconsumers will reject the product causing the price to fall. The\nreason being is that for high involvement products, the consumer is\nbuying the prestige associated with the product, not the product\nitself. This happened with Gucci in the 80s and 90s when a greedy\nmanagement expanded the once exclusive brand, into many new\nproduct classes. It lost its exclusivity and cachet. Sales plummeted\nand only when a new CEO dramatically pruned the product mix did\nit regain some of its past allure.\nLuxury goods also have another quirk. Demand for some luxury\ngoods actually rises when the price rises. Economists classify these\ntypes of products as Veblengoods, named after economist Thorstein\nVeblen who believed most levels of consumption in upper classes\nwere merely acts of displaying wealth and social status. Perfumes\nprovide an example. For most people, especially husbands, we\ncannot easily tell the quality of a perfume, yet as we rush through\nan airport on the way home we know that it would be prudent to\nbring our long suffering wife a bottle of nice French perfume. What\nmany do is use price as an indicator of quality, hence the higher the\nprice, within limits, the more we are apt to buy that brand. Many of\nus may well buy wine the same way. When we have the boss and\nher husband over for dinner we buy an expensive wine on faith that\nif it is costly it must be good, real wine lovers know this is not\nnecessarily so! Sadly for most of us, this applies for but a few\nproduct categories, for most we have to live in a world where we\nmust reduce price to increase demand, not so good from a prof-\nitability viewpoint.\nHipster fashion icon American Apparel never goes on sale, they\nprovide fashion basics which are timeless and seasonless.

Each one measures certain\nvariables which in turn, offer an insight on the dynamics within a\nmarket. However, due to the nature of the modelling process, some\nelements are always ignored. The hope is that the model ignores the\ninconsequential variables, or more formally stated, minimizes the\nerror while measuring the variance between observations. As such,\nwhen estimating which of the eight states of demand your product\nis experiencing, it is prudent to use more than one model and\nsubject it to many tests. We discuss three types below.\nThe first type of model is to use past history to predict the\nfuture. In its simplest form, the relationship between demand and\nprice is calculated and is used to predict future behaviour. This is\noften used when coming up with the sales quotes for the next year,\nif inflation is 3% and the firm wants to grow at 5%, all quotes are\nraised 8% for next year. If the product is being sold in a mature\nmarket, it is plausible a simple model is all that is needed.

The key to\nemploying statistics to predict demand is to build a model that is\nappropriate to the market the product exists within.\nA second approach is conducting price experiments. Varying the\nprice of a product at the same store or at different locations of a\nfranchised chain, assuming all other factors are constant, will yield\nan accurate portrayal of the demand curve. This can be done in\nsupermarkets where they have many stores and it is relatively easy\nto do experiments like this.\nConducting market surveys is a third way to measure the\ndemand for a product. Consumers are randomly selected and are\nasked questions related to how much of a product they\u2019d buy at\ndifferent price levels. Tabulating the responses will yield the\ndemand curve. It should be noted that consumers do not make a\npurchase purely based on price; they evaluate how much value they\nare offered from the entire marketing mix. As such, surveys tend to\nunderstate a consumer\u2019s willingness to pay. An experienced\nmanager will have a good idea by how much.\nPRICE-ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\nThe slope of the demand curve illustrates the market\u2019s sensitivity to\ndifferent prices. The more elastic the demand curve the more sensi-\ntive the market is to a price change. Visually speaking, the flatter\nthe line the greater the effect a change in price will have on\ndemand. Contrast this with an inelastic demand curve or steeper\nline, a small change in price will have a lower effect in magnitude\non demand. Firms employ differentiation and branding strategies to\ntransform their demand curve to become more inelastic. Once\nconsumers are convinced of the differences they become less price\nsensitive. If branding or differentiation strategies cannot steepen\nthe demand curve, lowering price will result in higher revenues.\nESTIMATING COSTS\nOnce the demand curve is estimated, the firm gains an idea of how\nmany units they could sell given a particular price.

Operating costs come in various\nforms, and we discuss a number of them in the following section.\nTYPES OF COSTS\nA company\u2019s cost structure takes two forms: variable and fixed.\nVariablecostsdepend on the level of production, while fixedcostsare\nconstant regardless of whether or not the company chooses to produce\nnothing. The sum of variable and fixed costs is called the totalcost.\nFor companies that produce a handful of goods, speaking solely\nin terms of fixed, variable and total costs is sufficient. However, for\nthose firms that sell millions of units, the importance of maxi-\nmizing scale economies is paramount since a small increase in\nefficiency has a large effect in magnitude on revenue. Therefore,\ncalculating the averageunitcostis needed to determine the right\nprice. Average unit cost is calculated by dividing the total cost into\nthe level of output.\nThe price charged to consumers for a product must cover the\ntotal cost at a given level of production and return a profit to the\nfirm. Otherwise the company is losing money on each item it is\nproducing, a quick entry strategy into bankruptcy.\nThere are two other costs a firm must take into account when\nmaking a pricing decision, sunk costs and opportunity costs. A sunk\ncostis one that the firm already incurred and cannot recover. Trying to\nrecoup a sunk cost is ill-advised because incorporating the additional\ncost of a past mistake inflates the average cost per unit. With a high\naverage cost, the firm will require a higher rate of return on their\ninvestment. Those forgone investments are called the opportunity\ncost. When mistakes are made, it is better to write off sunk costs\ninstead of making more investments trying to make the idea work.\nACTIVITY-BASED COST-ACCOUNTING (ABC)\nHaving now established some of the costs a firm must be aware of,\nmeasuring costs accurately is extremely important.

How do you do this? A\npopular method is to adopt a leaner business model to do business\nwith them. For example, instead of using your most expensive\nmarketing tool, your sales force, use inside salespeople or e-\ncommerce to deal with them.

The image is rather comical,\nboth sets of customers would be quickly outraged by the normal\nbehaviour of the front desk clerk from the other world. The Motel\nSix business model means that the front desk must move each new\ncustomer through in short order. Meanwhile at a Four Seasons, it is\nexpensive, but the service, you can complain about your day to the\nclerk checking you as long as your heart desires! Now this perhaps\nis an extreme example but the principle remains. It is nearly impos-\nsible for one person to offer great service to one customer and then\noffer a considerably though appropriate level of service on the next\ncall. When you have two customer service levels you almost always\nhave to have two separate organizations.\nA firm must always try to renew their top or platinum\ncustomers, as they are central to profitability, sadly, platinum\ncustomers are lost every year.

It states\nthat the more often a task is performed, the less cost will be\nincurred in the future. This relationship between experience and\naccumulated production has been the source of commentary for\nhundreds of years. But it wasn\u2019t until 1925 that it was closely\nstudied. At the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the United\nStates, engineers discovered as aircraft production doubled, the\nassembling time decreased by 10% to 15%, regardless of the size of\nthe plant. Studies on other industries yielded similar results. The\nmore workers produced an item, the more productive they became,\nyet the learning curve gains were the same regardless of plant size.\nThe realized efficiency level varied between industries, but amaz-\ningly, the maxim that the learning curve effect affects an operation\nregardless of scale remains largely true.\nBeing the first manufacturer to maximize the learning curve\ngives the firm a substantial advantage over its competitors. Because\nper unit costs are lower, it can use that cost advantage for one of\nthree things \u2013 to give a lower price to customers making it harder\nfor competitors to compete profitably. Secondly, spend that extra\nmoney on brand building and other marketing activities to differ-\nentiate your product from competitors or thirdly, just be more\nprofitable. Once the competition has caught up, the firm should\nreassess the strategic importance of the business.\nANALYSING COMPETITORS\u2019 COSTS, PRICES AND\nOFFERS TO POSITION THE PRODUCT\nBy this stage, the price of the product is beginning to take shape:\nthe demand curve provides an insight as to the market\u2019s responsive-\nness to different prices, and the optimal cost structure is determined.\nAt this stage, the product should be evaluated against the competi-\ntion using a balanced scorecard.

This pricing method is widely used by manu-\nfacturers of mass-merchandise and professionals working in service\nindustries. Below is an example of how markup pricing works.\nLet us suppose a mid-career manager inherits a million dollars\nfrom a beloved aunt who happened to be a shrewd investor. The\ninheritance is enough start-up capital to buy all the necessary equip-\nment to open up a high-scale restaurant, the mid-career manager\u2019s\ndream job.\nBecause our restaurateur has some managerial expertise, she\nknows going into the business is risky, and believes a rate of return\nof 30% will adequately compensate her for her troubles. Her cost\nstructure is as follows:\nBefore calculating the markup, our entrepreneur must know the\ncost per unit. The formula is as follows:\nUnit cost = Variable Cost + (Fixed Costs/Unit Sales)\nPlugging our numbers into the formula yields:\nUnit Cost = $5 + ($1,000,000/80,000)\nUnit Cost = $17.50Price 73\n80,000 Sales Expected$1,000,000 Costs Fixed$5 labour) (inc.

To calculate the markup price, the\nformula is:\nShe would have to charge $25 per plate to achieve a 30% rate of\nreturn.\nMarkup pricing is often referred to as fair pricing. It allows the\nproducer to cover their costs and earn a fair rate of return.\nHowever, markup pricing ignores the consumer\u2019s perceived-value of\nthe product. As we demonstrated in the last chapter, products that\noffer many benefits command a higher price in the marketplace.\nFair pricing also ignores the hard reality of competitor\u2019s pricing\nwhich in effect provides a ceiling which we cannot rise above unless\nwe have successfully differentiated our product in a way relevant to\nthe customer so that they are willing to pay a premium.\nTARGET RETURN PRICING\nTarget Return pricing involves setting a price that yields an\nexpected return on investment. Do not confuse return on invest-\nment (ROI) with the expected rate of return. The former calculates\nthe effectiveness of the capital spent, the latter, is the opportunity\ncost.

Recall, the total cost is the sum of\nthe variable cost and the fixed cost. Where the total cost curve\nintersects with the projected revenue curve is the firm\u2019s break-even\npoint. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\nBreak-even volume = Fixed Costs/(Price \u2013 variable cost)\nPlugging in the numbers from our culinary example yields:\nOur restaurateur must sell 50,000 plates of food to cover her oper-\nating expenses.\nPERCEIVED-VALUE PRICING\nThe drawback to the previous two pricing methods is that they\naggregate consumers into one group. In reality there are different\ntypes of consumers, each has a different perception as to what the\nprice of the product should be. Some purchase a good because of\nthe price, some buy a good because of the quality and features,\nwhile others buy products because they are concerned about price\nand do not take into account the power of the brand. Brands\nreduce uncertainty, and the consumer is willing to pay a premium\nto eliminate it.

We call it black box because they do\nnot discuss or often even know what the technology is inside the\nbox. In contrast is the full service vendor who not only has the box\nbut also understands the technology inside it: they offer great\nservice, advice on how to use the technology in your business and\nthus adds very considerable value to the basic hardware itself. The\nproblem is that you must effectively communicate the extra value\nthat your business model creates for the customer in a way that\nthey will be willing to pay the higher price necessitated by your full\nservice model. This is not easy with a black box competitor\nlingering around because they will keep hammering home their one\nsimple point \u2013 they are cheaper!

But many\nfirms, including IBM manage to effectively communicate their\nvalue and win their fair share of business.\nVALUE PRICING\nValue pricing is a method where the producer charges a low price\nfor a higher-quality good. Large retailers often employ this\npricing method to attract customers to their stores. Once within\nthe store, the customer is more inclined to purchase non-advertised\ngoods because of the convenience of buying all of their goods under\none roof. To some degree Wal-Mart has a value pricing model\nwith lower prices on reasonable quality goods; due to their\nincred ible volumes they can negotiate the best price from virtually\nevery manufacturer they deal with. One friend of ours sold to\nWal-Mart and his firm had to agree that Wal-Mart would get the\nbest price in the country which makes it easier for Wal-Mart to\nunder price their competitors and still be quite profitable. This idea\nalso leads to the phenomenon of lossleaders,that is that some\nretailers, supermarkets for example, realize that very few customers\nknow the prices for more than a few goods in their shop. Think of\nwhat prices you know of goods you regularly buy at a supermarket,\nwe can only think of milk and beer! What these stores do is make\nsure they have low prices on those few items, that consumers\nknow so when customers see those low prices they assume that\nother prices are also low, creating a positive halo effect of low cost\nfor the store.Price76", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2292, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f9b029a-0892-4cf5-ad7a-7df1bf0671ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f9b029a-0892-4cf5-ad7a-7df1bf0671ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "436e0d45-184b-4086-b7a9-fa178d448ccc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "d6ee35251453d0ae11249dc4a4c006782e4c743c5f0d8d25e51d819b5209ebfd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ef0f6f5-94ef-4cdf-b5ad-96c3656145bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "ef066e46d5fde396448fe5e821733fbf58eaa1514f9b223be6485d6d2149f1cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "608ce1c6-101c-4cd2-a3b1-8b90e0aca3bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1eff95089a47bf15f83f9a494874e46cea7dfeb42e5a72fd25bf148bac13d04e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "GOING-RATE PRICING\nGoing-rate pricing entails the producer pricing their product\nstrictly according to the price charged by competition. This pricing\nmethod is often found in commodities markets, where the differ-\nentiation between products is virtually nil. Marketers hate\ncommodities because it is hard to make a profit unless you are the\nlowest cost producer; of course, there is logically only one low cost\nproducer so every other firm competing with them will be scram-\nbling for profit. That is why marketers always try to differentiate\nin a way relevant to the customer and in a way that the customer\nwill accept that you really are different from your competition.

Talk about a potentially undiffer-\nentiated product \u2013 the government of Canada certifies that the\nwheat is Grade A and so on. Yet he said that they manage to differ-\nentiate what is almost the same physical product in 24 different\nways.

Then price slowly decreases until the bidder agrees to the\nprice. The price continues to decrease until the entire stock is sold.\nENGLISH AUCTION\nAn English-style auction is the opposite of a Dutch auction. A\nminimum price is set, and bidders continue to raise their offers,\nuntil the person who wants the good the most outbids the competi-\ntion. This is the most popular of bidding systems.\nSEALED BIDS\nA sealed bid system is often employed by a buyer who wants to\nextract the lowest price from a group of sellers who offer relatively\nsimilar goods or services. In a sealed bid system, the bidders are\nprevented from knowing the value of other proposed bids. That lack\nof information forces the seller \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 not to bid\nbelow their cost, and not to bid too high otherwise they\u2019ll lose the\ncontract. Whenever the government announces a public works\nprogram, they invite bidders to participate in a sealed bid auction.\nTransparency and having lots of bidders are two requirements to\nensure the process is competitive. This is widely used by govern-\nment and when ignored a political scandal often ensues, as has\nhappened in Germany, England and the US in recent years. Even if\nthe governing party doesn\u2019t tamper with the bidding process, there\nis a potential for bidders to get together and agree to rig the price;\nthis is called collusion and is illegal.\nGROUP PRICING\nFinally, group pricing is a method where a group of buyers pool\ntheir resources, and use their buying power to negotiate a lower\nprice from the seller.

They\nare psychological pricing, gain and risk sharing.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING\nInformation plays a primary role in a consumer\u2019s mind as they\nformulate their perceived value of a product. Elements such as price\nof substitutes, advertising, consumer-advocacy reports and the\nreputation of the company contribute to brand equity. Eventually,\nthe consumer decides what the price of a product should be, any\ndeviation from that price is either a bargain, or too expensive.\nMarketers call this perceived price a referenceprice. Research has\nshown that consumers are more willing to buy a product if the\nretail price is listed as $999 than if it were priced at $1,000. The\npsychological barrier between 999 and 1000 is larger than the\ndifference of a dollar.\nGAIN AND RISK SHARING PRICING\nA GRS pricing method is a guarantee on the part of the supplier to\ndeliver on the promises about the product. Should the product not\nmeet the consumer\u2019s satisfaction, the customer can return the\nproduct and obtain a refund. Reducing the risk the consumer is\nexposed to makes the decision to buy a product more favourable.\nPRICE DISCRIMINATION\nAs the name suggests, price discrimination is a method of charging\ndifferent prices for the same product to different consumers. For\nthis system to work, the producer must be able to segment the\nmarket. Second, trading between different segments is impossible.\nThird, competitors cannot directly compete against the producer.\nFourth, consumers accept that price discrimination does occur.

And finally, it must be legal.\nPrice discrimination occurs in many industries. Software compa-\nnies for example charge corporations a much higher fee than\nindividual users. Airlines steadily increase the cost of flying as the\ndeparture date nears. Many nightclubs charge different entrance\nfees for males and females. If conducted correctly, price discrimina-\ntion will result in higher revenue for the company. What we see in\na number of industries is that price discrimination is becoming\nharder to pull off today. Widespread use of the Internet means that\npeople are less apt to accept price discrimination. Airlines for\nexample are beginning to move to simpler and more transparent\nairfare structures because of customer upset over the fact that the\nperson beside them on the plane paid a much lower fare. The old\nneed to stay over a Saturday night or an American on a visit to\nEurope having to stay for a minimum of seven days is no longer\nrequired by many airlines, it is simply not sustainable any more.\nWe always wondered why European authorities would insist that\nNorth Americans must at minimum go to Europe for 7 days; were\nwe that desperate in need for long exposure to European culture?\nWhat is much more widely known now was that it was not a\ngovernment requirement but a way for airlines to get frequent\ntravellers to pay a high premium for the privilege of going over to\nLondon or Paris for just a day or two.\nGEOGRAPHICAL PRICING\nGeographical pricing is employed when a company sells the same\nproduct in different locations. Because the product must be deliv-\nered to different places, the logistical cost is directly proportional to\nthe distance. As such, the producer must charge a higher price for\ngoods that are furthest from the plant. However, the price the\nproducer charges their most distant markets is tempered by the\nprice of substitutes in the local market and the potential for arbi-\ntrage, where a third party decides to buy the product in the cheap\nmarket and resell it in the more expensive one. In some cases\ntrading does occur, we call this greymarketing, which refers to the\nflow of goods through distribution channels other than those\nauthorized by the manufacturer or producer.

Frequently this occurs when\nthe price of an item is significantly higher in one country than\nanother. Electronic goods and pharmaceuticals are two common\nproducts where this occurs. Entrepreneurs will buy the product\nwhere it is available cheaply, import it legally to the target market\nand sell it a price which provides a healthy profit but which is below\nthe normal market price there. This is a particular problem when\nthe price is higher in another country not because of price gouging\nbut simply because it is more expensive to do business in the one\ncountry. For example, London is expensive, retail rentals, office\nspace, eating out and simply just living. It is only fair that firms\nwho sell there charge more than lower cost Greece. It does cost\nNikon profit though when a Briton on holiday in Greece picks up a\nNikon camera there at a lower price and brings it back to London\nand expects Nikon to honour the warranty in his home country.\nOTHER MARKETING-MIX ELEMENTS\nBecause markets are not perfectly competitive, information plays a\nvital role in the decision making process. As such, consumers will pay\na premium for products that are of good quality and well-advertised\ninstead of buying products of comparable quality that are not as well-\nknown. In the world of high-tech there is a saying that \u201cYou don\u2019t\nget fired for buying IBM\u201d. What this saying means is that IBM is\nwidely accepted as having top quality, if it breaks down, that is just\nthe vicissitudes of life, not because you bought cheap and saved\nmoney at the moment of purchase but paid through the nose later\non when the system broke down. That is also why many people will\na premium for a well-known brand.

What\u2019s more, providing\ncustomer-service for after sales assistance, reliable delivery sched-\nules and a commitment to preserve the quality of the product are\nimportant factors in the decision making process. Reducing the\ncognitivedissonanceof the consumer leads to a higher likelihood\nthey will select the product, even if it means paying a premium.Price 81", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2411, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8836e476-2bfa-48b5-8935-82853f5c5096": {"__data__": {"id_": "8836e476-2bfa-48b5-8935-82853f5c5096", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b940add3-6b6e-480e-ae1a-02eb7ab3e9e7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "935654ff1b7a13783f9551c844ea567e4750e9aba512009998858d541361ce0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64271a3b-9f29-4838-962a-8c4e8d71d2e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "04f330cded0c4edffb9db2c8d613d379f2b14021e85ee8815ed6fc58f2a4c09a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09974d4b-4675-45f5-a47c-7e421d49a91b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1dde6df4e86cebb4e404cddc0cacd9a962137dc00fbf780da3e17d49508308dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SUMMARY\n\u2022Price is most flexible of the marketing Ps.\n\u2022The perceived value of goods varies between individuals.\n\u2022Setting the price is a six-step process that starts with\ndefining the marketing objective and ends with the price\nselected.\n\u2022The required rate of return is a primary factor in estab-\nlishing the minimum price charged.\n\u2022Customers always have a reference price in mind when\nmaking a purchasing decision.\nCRITICAL QUESTIONS\n1 Compare and contrast the various marketing objectives a\nfirm can pursue.

Promotion involves disseminating information\nabout a product or a company using five different key types of\npromotions: advertising, sales promotion, public relations, personal\nselling and direct marketing. Together, the five elements are all part\nof a company\u2019s promotionmix. Each type of promotion employs a\ndifferent set of approaches to communicate with the current and\nprospective customer.

The channel is the\nmedium which the message travels through and finally the message\nitself, which is the information the marketer wishes to disseminate.\nThough this is simple to say, even the best-designed message faces\ndifficulties reaching the intended audience. Once the message is\nreleased through one or many channels, it must permeate through\nthe tens of thousands of other messages sent by other marketers\nwho are trying to attract the attention of the audience. If the\nmessage manages to diffuse through the clutter and reach the audi-\nence, it faces another hurdle: studies estimate the average American\nadult receives in excess of 3,000 messages everyday. This is not to\nsay that the average American is simply sitting around watching\ntelevision all day! When a bus goes by, it has multiple messages on\nthe side. A co-worker walks into a meeting with a Starbucks coffee\ncup and a Nike sweater on, two more exposures. You watch ER and\nthe plot includes a Lincoln car, another exposure this time to a\nproduct placement in a leading show. It is impossible for a person to\nabsorb and respond to that much information. Rather than be over\nstimulated and go nuts, most consumers in the developed world\nsimply have learned to ignore most messages. This is a huge chal-\nlenge for marketers.\nThere are more issues. Over the last two decades significant\nchanges have occurred in the media industry. Due mostly to tech-\nnological innovation, the number of channels to reach potential\nand current customers has exploded. But while the total number\nof channels has increased, the size of the audience remains rela-\ntively stable. In other words, mass media channels have been\nfragmented into smaller, more focused channels catering to special-\ninterest audiences. Today there is much more than TV; there are\nhundreds of satellite radio stations, podcasts, and the biggest change\nof all, the ubiquitous Internet. For marketers mediafragmentation\nis both a boon and a curse; it translates into an opportunity to craft\nbetter messages for a particular audience. The opportunity to\ncustomize the promotional mix to small groups introduces the\nrisk of sending conflicting messages to different audiences. Podcasts\nare an intriguing example.

However, in most cases,\npersuading the audience to make a purchase is the desired response.\nConsumers rarely make impulse purchases, especially on expensive\nitems which we earlier called high involvement goods; they gather\nfacts before they\u2019re ready to buy. A model called the hierarchyof\neffectsmodeltraces the six stages consumers typically pass through\nbefore making a purchase. The desired response sought is to move\nthe audience from one stage to another. Early in a marketing\ncampaign the results measure of the success of your market efforts\nis if you have moved potential customers from one stage to the\nnext; of course, the ultimate goal is to turn them into customers and\nloyal ones at that, but it is a process you build a stage at a time.\nThe first is the awareness stage. Consumers residing in this\nstage have either never heard of the firm or are uncertain of the\nbenefits offered by the firm\u2019s products. The objective in this case\nwould be to design a promotion mix that increases the consumer\nawareness around the product or the firm itself. Danone, a French\nbased multinational that produces a wide variety of yogurt prod-\nucts, is facing considerable difficulties convincing North American\nconsumers that fortified yogurt is more than just a dairy product, it\nis also a suitable and healthy snack food. Much of their current\nmarketing strategy in North America involves handing out free\nsamples supplemented by an advertising campaign that repeatedly\nconnects their product to healthy and active lifestyles.\nThe second stage is knowledge . Consumers in this stage of the\nbuying process recognize the product, but do not possess enough\ninformation to make an informed decision. Marketers must deter-\nmine which information the target audience lacks and design a\nmessage that fills the gap.\nOnce the audience is aware of a product and understands the bene-\nfits offered; the marketer tries to move their target audience through\nthe final stages of the buying process by making consumers feel better\nabout making the purchase. The third stage is liking , which entails\ncreating positive messages to promote the product. This is where the\nemotional part of the marketing kicks in.

Many Coke ads are simply getting\nus to feel a warm positive glow about Coke so when we pitch up at the\nsupermarket we feel subconsciously drawn toward Coke, because we a\nhave a positive emotional response to it.

If consumers agree with\nthe self-assessment, they move to the fifth stage, conviction . Finally,\nother promotional offers such as rebates, free upgrades or similar\ntools can be employed to nudge the reluctant buyer to make a\npurchase. You often will see this on ads on television selling music or\nbooks where they will throw in another product free if you buy\nnow, now, now! In marketing parlance this is a call for action in the\nmoment.

Appeals to the audience moral code is\nusually practised by organizations promoting such public services\nas safe driving, trying to encourage you to practice safe sex, stop\nsmoking, send money to help those in a disaster area, etc.\nFinally, emotional messages attempt to stir an emotional\nresponse to move consumers from one stage in the buying process\nto another.

The use of airbrushed supermodels\nfor example is known to contribute to such mental illnesses as\nanorexia nervosa because images of an unobtainable ideal degrades\nalready low levels of confidence in adolescent teenage girls.\nHowever, not all emotional messages are negative minded.

You\nshould really take advantage of the big screen plus you must\nremember they paid to be in those seats, unlike at home where,\nwhether they realize it or not they are watching free television\nbecause of the commercials, so you have to adjust your content to\nsuit that reality.\nHaving discussed the theory of communication and various\nstrategies to ensure the chances a message reaches the intended\nreceiver, we now examine the various tools of the promotion mix.\nSELECT THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS\nNow that a message has been constructed, and the source to\ntransmit the message is identified, the manager must select\nbetween personal and non-personal communication channels to\nreach their target audiences. Personal communication channels\ninvolve two or more people communicating directly to each other.\nThis includes using a telephone, email or regular mail, satellite tele-\nvision, or simply face to face. Whereas non-personal\ncommunication channels involve using the media to transmit the\nmessage. More on the advantages of each later.\nESTABLISHING THE BUDGET\nTraditionally, there is a tension between marketing managers and\nfinancial managers. Marketers believed that the product that was\nthe most heavily promoted would be the product that succeeds in\nthe market. Financial managers, who agree with that assessment for\nthe most part, temper the enthusiasm with the droll reality that\nresources are not unlimited; a corporation exists to maximize profit.\nBecause of this tension, compromises must be reached in estab-\nlishing the communications budget.Promotion92", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2086, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e79cb2ed-d45c-4ef8-8a2d-ac5035e7eab7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e79cb2ed-d45c-4ef8-8a2d-ac5035e7eab7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05825fd9-e088-40ae-8e2d-807fc9c1117e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "cc75854b4e09e95ba688582bde34c67e2ee35bb8e1fa1841fe18f613704f6885", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "08e978d0-58ba-4701-8418-d46ca5a27802", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "ae90dbba0a5bfa74aa3e22b28795a7af2764617d8a4fe46ed341683711767bcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "40084fcc-cc7e-4ec8-ab49-cf38e8c3d2c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a466858237fd60a46f018e646abad2bffd81bd8b1253ec94d1fe7ca6bf892781", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AFFORDABLE METHOD AND COMPETITIVE PARITY METHOD\nThe affordable method is an ad-hoc approach to establishing a\ncommunications budget. Often it entails a manager asking the\naccounting department what is the most that can be spent on adver-\ntising. This approach can work if high demand exists for the product,\nor if the company is a small firm, where formalities are blurred.\nHowever, if this method is employed in a medium to large sized\norganization it leads to chaos. Without a reliable budget, marketers\ncannot forge long-term promotion plans, and financial managers\ncannot reliably forecast future profits.\nThe competitive parity method is also an ad-hoc approach to\nestablishing a communications budget. Instead of using their own\nexpertise, the firm decides to use the expertise of their competitor\nto determine how much money should be spent. In other words,\ntheir communication expenditures mirror their competition\u2019s. It is\nnot a good sign if a firm relies on the marketing expertise of their\ncompetitors, though if Coke sees Pepsi is running a big new\ncampaign, they may well feel obliged to respond in kind.\nPERCENTAGE OF SALES METHOD\nA more reliable method of establishing a communications budget is\nto fix the budget to the performance of the product itself. In other\nwords, though the communications budget differs according to\nstage of the business cycle, the percentage spent remains equal.\nWhat\u2019s more, if every competitor adopts this practice, the industry\nbegins to demonstrate conditions that economists term market\nequilibrium.\nAs promising as the percentage of sales method sounds, there are\na number of disadvantages. First, the method assumes product sales\nare closely correlated with the business cycle. Some products are\nalways in demand, and that advantage can be used to gain more\nmarket share when the competition is languishing. But if the firm\nemployed a percentage of sales method, it cannot take advantage of\nmarket opportunities. More concerning, it assumes markets are in a\nstate of equilibrium. Markets are never in a state of equilibrium.\nThere is a constant churning of firms entering and exiting markets,\nnew technologies destroy old industrial structures, and managerialPromotion 93", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2221, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40084fcc-cc7e-4ec8-ab49-cf38e8c3d2c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "40084fcc-cc7e-4ec8-ab49-cf38e8c3d2c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce79794a-e21c-498b-9cd3-98525d3876ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "0d136b509ed7c59906d373a2bb42c5540bc2b1d6ec921723c9ff6fdccaae4c31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e79cb2ed-d45c-4ef8-8a2d-ac5035e7eab7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "cc75854b4e09e95ba688582bde34c67e2ee35bb8e1fa1841fe18f613704f6885", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83812295-6c1f-4b49-875e-b5e00892deec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a250c162edac37599460798965b4e107c6dbb652e0690e473d7274993d16e63f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "practices re-engineer how business is conducted.

Why it\nis not as widely used as we would like is because it is hard work.\nThis method allows firms to capitalize on market opportunities as\nthey arise. Firms choose between a pushstrategyand a pull\nstrategy. A push strategy entails using different promotional\ntools to push the product through the channels to market. The\nmanufacturer directs their promotional activities to convince their\nintermediaries to carry a product. This may include for special\nbonuses for the store and the salesperson to sell a particular brand\nor product. If several competitors do this it can lead to a bonus war\nwhich is gratifying for the salespeople but lousy for the profits of\nthe manufacturers. The intermediaries in turn, direct their promo-\ntional activities toward the final customer. Whereas employing a\npull strategy entails taking the opposite approach. The producer\ndirects their promotional activities to the final customer, who in\nturn seeks the product from channel members and promotes their\nprocessors to the final consumer. Channel members in turn, react\nby placing more orders with the producer. Many companies use\nboth strategies and when they work together they are the most\npowerful, that is a customer walks in asking for the product and the\ncompany not only has it but is enthusiastic about selling it, rather\nthan trying to sell the person another product where they make a\nbigger commission. In all of their promotional material aimed at the\nfinal consumer, computer-chip maker Intel demonstrates the many\nbenefits of using the latest microchip. Intel also insists any machine\nthat uses an Intel chip must have a sticker on the computer that\nindicates one of their chips powers the machine.\nBuyers also employ the same strategies to accomplish an objec-\ntive.

Or the customer could push the idea through the inter-\nmediary first before getting to the manufacturer. It all depends on\nhow you look at the situation.\nMarketers can elect to use a pull or push strategy to promote\ntheir product. The strategy employed depends heavily on the rela-\ntionship the seller has with its customers. If their product is\nbranded as one that offers experiential benefits, a push strategy not\nonly creates a buzz in the marketplace, but also creates a situation\nwhere the customer is requesting products to be offered, which as\nwe mentioned earlier in the book is the ultimate aim of marketing \u2013\nget the customer to come to you.

And through repeated exposure, the audience\naccepts the product\u2019s positioning and comes to trust the product to\ndeliver the promised benefits.\nGood advertising provides reasons to customers to buy a product\nor service. To create a good ad, the marketer must create a message\nthat is distinct, meaningful and credible. Failure to do so results in\nthe message being lost in the noise surrounding the audience.\nHowever, crafting a distinct message is but one part of an effective\nad. The message must also be crafted with their interests in mind. If\nthe message cannot demonstrate how or what extra value they\nreceive, the audience will not react. Finally, if the audience does not\nbelieve the product, service, organization or idea delivers on the\npromised benefits, they dismiss the message outright.Promotion 95", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2237, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8143ffe5-0837-4411-97aa-ee1694dd5e9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8143ffe5-0837-4411-97aa-ee1694dd5e9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f91e3a0-9e5c-4581-add2-6323227a3d59", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "1bf3bf9cbb29cfac108cfe9a8e1776bae2067ae8ae832289cd05926b1181586f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83812295-6c1f-4b49-875e-b5e00892deec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "00da7bd78aa465d28fc53627ed1b620c93f5c13de2eca28a325861d74c04959f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e77932fc-7c19-48ab-931b-f4411b8613d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff37c6f8fbf9ea6b6368812f4e7bf3454a0fd2610f8d42893239fbd118d0046d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "TYPES OF MESSAGES\nSlice of life Demonstrates the product being used in a typical\nsetting.\nStatement Challenges the audience into acting on their\ncomplacency.

Let\u2019s now turn to a bit\nmore on buzz which is an increasingly important tool in the post-\nmodern marketer\u2019s kit bag.\nBUZZ MARKETING\nAs we discussed earlier, we live in an over communicated to age.\nThe average Westerner is exposed to thousands of commercials\u2019\nmessages a day. It all adds up to too many messages chasing too\nlittle attention span. Tom Davenport, a well-known IT prof has\nfamously said, \u201cA few observant people have begun to argue that\ntoday\u2019s scarce resource \u2013 and thus the currency of the new economy \u2013\nis actually attention\u201d. We think he is absolutely spot on. So how do\nwe get through our over communicated, over advertised to market?\nOne key answer is buzz marketing. Not a new idea but one that is\ngaining increasing street cred. Buzz marketing allows you to get in\n\u201cunder the radar\u201d.\nNowhere is truer than for the Nexters generation. For them, the\nmost important influencers regarding spending in order of impor-\ntance are friends, television, magazines, movies, the Internet and\nsports. Having seen more commercials than any generation before,\nthe youngsters are advertising savvy and are hard to influence.\nYoungsters are sensitive when it comes to being marketed to. They\nwant to discover the brand through underground channels, not classic\nads. To break through the clutter, commercials need to be exception-\nally original. Otherwise, flooding the air with GRPs (gross rating\npoints \u2013 a way of measuring advertising spend) will only annoy\nthe target market and damage both the brand and sales. Taking the\ncreative approach pays handsomely. Brand preference builds at much\nyounger ages than ever before. As teenagers have more disposable\nincome than previous generations, their lifetime value is high if\nthey remain loyal to the brand. Capturing this segment is crucial\nfor the future of many companies. We have to ask ourselves, what\ncan firms do to lure the reluctant youngsters to buy their products?\nBuzz seems to be one key way of going underneath their radar.\nThere is little research about buzz as it is a relatively new\nconcept and scholars only recently started to explore the buzzPromotion100", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2295, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bff705a3-e611-41b7-86f5-ba46591522eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bff705a3-e611-41b7-86f5-ba46591522eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e609463-1b0c-41d8-848e-55c4cc25876e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "f271280b1651c549ea2c7f8ec80e2aeb58553b3ccc786aeddf6bc5f38a6ab833", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd36d669-279a-4c93-9fc7-fbfc0d25b5df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "34392dec9ca0c0734556f5fe9fe22039852e82fc230ed21c101a4e18c2e05882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6727592-f396-4d84-b444-b2cd4713edac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6f73e0f61c16950f20ad48e671e16d2303c06c989ecae7ff5e66e0086d6c934", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "generators and their effects. Buzz is formed by all the discussions\nregarding a brand, product, event and so on among people at any\nmoment in time. What are some characteristics of the buzz? Some\nearly lessons are emerging. First, buzz spreading cannot be\ncontrolled. It is spread exponentially through word of mouth, buzz\ncan be generated, but cannot be moulded, directed, or stopped. Buzz\nis like a snowball which grows, gets momentum and finally melts if\nit is not refuelled. Second, the message cannot be controlled. The\nmessage is distorted and filtered by every transmitter and receptor\nof buzz. Its downside is that word of mouth can become negative,\nwith important implications for the product or company that tries\nto generate buzz. To be effective, underground buzz must not be\nperceived as advertising by the target audience, as people will not\ntransmit a commercial message. Therefore, companies need to pay\nattention not to mix classical advertising techniques with a buzz\ncampaign, at least during the buzz building stage. Later, when the\nsnowball starts rolling, traditional means can be used to reinforce\nand fuel the buzz.\nBuzz cannot be targeted at a specific segment of population, but\nrather it spreads through a network of hubs and spokes. Buzz\nspreads across the borders at the light of email and chat rooms. At\ncertain moments in time it affects clusters of customers and it\nrapidly migrates towards others crossing borders. A good way to\ncontrol the word of mouth and to reinforce it would be to use\nendorsers placed in hubs. For example, teenagers gather in dance\nclubs, schools, and cafeterias and so on. By hiring opinion leaders \u2013\ncool youngsters their peers look up to as endorsers of the brand,\nthe brand becomes more visible and \u201ccool by association\u201d. Procter\n& Gamble hires Tremor a company that sends products and\ncoupons to 13\u201319-year-olds in its database. Lured by the chance to\nwin products, the teenagers endorse products chosen by Tremor\u2019s\nclients.\nKeeping the supply limited in the incipient stages of the process\nfuels the buzz and drives demand. Teenagers generally avoid main-\nstream products, so unique gear that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have\u201d drives\nyoungsters crazy. When the company launches the product in the\nmass markets, there is no need to build awareness as teenagers\nalready know about the product. Few realize that by the time they\nbuy it the product is mainstream.

In\nmost cases, he or she is the sole link between seller and buyer, which\nin effect means they serve both parties. For the customer, the sales-\nperson is the official company representative. He or she will find and\ndevelop new business opportunities, negotiate the terms of the sales\nand follow-up once the sale is completed. At the same time, the sales-\nperson adopts the role of advocate, relaying customer concerns and\nwants to the relevant department. When Karl was a young salesperson\nat IBM, one day his boss John Houlden asked him to pull out his pay-\ncheque. Somewhat mystified he complied, knowing a moral would\nshortly be delivered. He asked, \u201cWhat is the name at the top?\u201d. He\nreplied, \u201cIBM\u201d. Following this his boss said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d\nEnd of lesson. Houlden was reminding Karl he was in danger of\nfalling into one of the traps a sales rep faces, that is, identifying with\nthe customer so much so that they forget who they really work for.\nSALES FORCE MANAGEMENT\nSales is a profession where individuals face high rejection rates, where\nthey work in isolation and where they too often find themselves\nconstantly travelling. As we stated in the first chapter, avoiding isola-\ntion and enhancing self-esteem are important determinants of human\nbehaviour. Because the work conditions are antithetical to those activi-\nties there is an impression that successful salespeople must have an\ninnate ability to sell. In other words, some are born to sell, others not.\nSelling is not genetic. Studies show that to succeed in sales, one must\nbe a risk-taker, be resourceful, be able to empathize and be filled with a\nnearly unbounded reservoir of self-confidence. Every human\npossesses these qualities and traits, however, the degree to which they\nare developed varies from person to person. Managers must therefore\ndevelop strategies that enhance a person\u2019s selling skills and reinforce a\nperson\u2019s sense of purpose. One of the most famous and well read sales\nmotivation writers is Zig Ziglar. One of his key points is that a sales-\nperson must learn to like hearing no. When you have heard seven nos,\nyou know the next person will say yes. Statistically this is true. The\nfirst person has a 50% chance of saying no, the second has a 25%\nchance, the third, 12.5%. Halving the probability of rejection four\nmore times will equal zero. This sounds particularly silly to most\npeople but for many salespeople this actually makes sense.People 107", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2513, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90bf5562-a8d9-4171-a1dd-167085f594db": {"__data__": {"id_": "90bf5562-a8d9-4171-a1dd-167085f594db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb4148a5-e9e3-4c89-8dff-2a831e25ffc6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "96062647b11d9700906fade824d3c730e57e0b2d60ddf9fa8ec80c498d4d4896", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6e7b7cc-b582-4044-9cfe-92f2ffc84530", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "5915a755691e9da85f079d2d52b8dc6627d4545af18c5972411f27529748793f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "48f4847b-2978-4a90-a788-edb561ba6713", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59096929cbeb456c1cd5c1851cb90ee2515c02523696dfb53b79ada4369775f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We define salesforcemanagementas the analysis, planning, imple-\nmentation, and control of all activities related to the sales force.\nThese activities include crafting the structure of the sales depart-\nment, delegating the tasks conducted by the salesperson, designing\nthe selling strategies employed by the sales force and all actions\nrelated to recruiting, training, compensation and evaluation of the\nsales force.

From a\ncustomer-oriented per spective, there are three advantages of imple-\nmenting a TSF struc ture. First, by assigning one salesperson to a\nparticular region, thereby creating a mutual dependence between the\nsalesperson and the customer, concerns raised by clients will be\nheard by a sympathetic ear . Second, it fosters higher customer satis-\nfaction because the salesperson can devise product bundles tailored\nspecifically to meet customer needs. Finally, by transferring the\nresponsibility of support to the company, the customer receives\nassurances that technical and customer service related issues are\nhandled by highly trained and competent staff whose primary task\nis to provide support. With a TSF, the argument goes, specialization\nbreeds customer assurance.\nThe belief that specialization will always breed customer assur-\nance is unfortunately idealistic. Granting exclusivity to the\nsalesperson can hinder the process of building customer relation-\nships because there are no checks to see if the salesperson is making\nreasonable attempts at finding new customers. But who can blame\nthe salesperson for not wanting to solicit new business? With the\nconstant travelling, low success rates and the salary correlated to\nperformance, it is natural to avoid such stress once a stable client\nbase is secured. Finally, if the product-line is diverse or highly tech-\nnical in nature, unless properly trained, the salesperson will have\ndifficulty communicating the benefits of each product of the\nproduct-line to potential customers.\nPRODUCT SALES FORCE\nFor companies that sell a myriad of products in numerous markets, or\nfor companies that manufacture products highly technical in nature, a\nproduct sales force structure (PSF) is more appropriate. This structure\nentails dividing the sales force along or a portion of the product-line,\nin effect transforming the salesperson into a product specialist.\nSpecialization allows the salesperson to develop a fluency with the\nproduct\u2019s benefits, which is articulated to customers.

Sales forces that work like this include many in the high-\ntech industry and many B2B sales forces. The in-depth knowledge of a\nparticular product and associated application is quite powerful.\nThough the product sales force structure overcomes the\ninherent disadvantages of employing a territorial sales force struc-\nture, there are intrinsic problems. First, creating an army of\nspecialists may actually lead to missed sales opportunities because\nthe specialist is not aware of the benefits offered by other products\nsold by the business. There is an old saying, \u201cif all you have is a\nhammer, everything looks like a nail\u201d. One of the advantages of a firm\nwith a broad product-line, like HP or IBM, is that they can argue\nthat they bring the proper tool to solve your problem, because\nthey have a big bag of tools while a smaller firm has only one solu-\ntion and that is what they will sell. Firms may also miss\nopportunities for additional sales because of sales myopia which\nnaturally occurs when you are focused on one product. A sales rep\nwho sells to just one customer or one industry gains tremendous\nknowledge of that firm and/or industry and can often go out into\nthe bowels of the firm to find new applications and needs for their\nfirms products, effectively stirring up additional business that\notherwise would lay dormant. They also can develop in-depth rela-\ntionships which are extremely helpful when problems occur, as\nthey will in any firm, both sides have invested in the relationship\nand are more apt to be patient, it is more like a marriage than a one\nnight stand.\nThe second disadvantage is related to the first. Bundling prod-\nucts often offers more value to customers than buying the\nproducts outright. However, bundling becomes more difficult\nbecause it requires coordination between the two sellers, not any\neasy thing to accomplish. One recent trend which many still find\nperplexing is that firms are competitors in the morning and then\nwork together as partners in the afternoon. This leads to some\nconfusion as to how to treat them and is an area we are still\nmucking about with.\nCUSTOMER SALES FORCE\nFor those businesses which sell specialized products or services, a\ncustomer sales force structure (CSF) would be more appropriate.People110", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2280, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f486f5ba-42ce-403b-9e1f-eac27004e962": {"__data__": {"id_": "f486f5ba-42ce-403b-9e1f-eac27004e962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d5f87e0-b49f-45c7-95bf-cdf5e54b4263", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "f8074aebd1543d0c6c51c4cf412c52de9fa2f9904211c5f9c06e4e671be99ded", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a29d284-cf0f-4305-a91e-ae8892f7c3b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "7a6f36eb8160f29da74c4f6c1bfc403573a069dcafcd77cc8f510650c0b812fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6354c823-76f9-4888-a7ad-431c18dbcb2e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "430a2f5b48420fbc5f53b73f8a3218b141fb253812c87aa384b1c0617c7536d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Under CSF, resources are divided according to the client\u2019s impor-\ntance; the more sales a buyer accounts for, the more resources there\nare dedicated to satisfying customer needs.

To do so, the company first groups\ntheir clients into a number of classes.

Suppose there\nare three classes of customers: A, B and C. There are 1000 type A\naccounts, 500 type B accounts and 100 type C accounts. Type A\naccounts require 20 calls a year. Type B accounts require 30,\nwhereas type C accounts require 5 calls a year. The sales force\u2019s\nworkload is the number of calls needed to make in one year would\nbe [(1000 x 20) + (500 x 30) + (100 x 5)] or 35,500 calls.

Training\nprovides the salesperson with information that not only includes\ndetails about the products that they will be selling, but also facts\nregarding the habits of the target market, and customer need.\nTraining also includes an explanation of the salesperson\u2019s responsi-\nbilities and duties, and the personal selling process, which we will\nexplain in depth later in the chapter. Finally, a well-designed\ntraining program will also include details on competitor strategies,\nthe company\u2019s mission, financial structure, organization and corpo-\nrate objectives. For brand sales reps, training around the\nprofessional sales call as discussed shortly is critical. Some firms are\nknown as providing great sales training, Xerox for example, and\nyoung people wanting a career in sales are well advised to start off\nwith one of these firms to get the basics down right as a great foun-\ndation to a career in sales.People 113", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a25ad67d-bc83-411e-af46-31714356ca0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a25ad67d-bc83-411e-af46-31714356ca0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ccb13c8-cca4-4f99-991d-8adc890124fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "1879badd2a6502249ea146156e619491799cbea705a708927358a6c4e59510d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28182838-7ff1-4fec-9272-af7e623a285e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "ae9eed248d846f5e2d610e7bd19965928417940f39ec59169e758173f58861d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b3eb9fe-d3e3-4ddc-9fb8-0ac52ff92cac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd3811338150a691ef7e9b7da5c5ef8311deacf1cd219db62b49b3706adf121a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "COMPENSATING PEOPLE\nDue to the physical and mental demands placed on a salesperson,\nthose aspects must be reflected in the compensation package offered\nto the salesperson. Depending on the working conditions, the salary\ncould be simply a fixed salary, or a salary plus commission or a\nsalary plus bonuses. Management must decide on which combina-\ntion or mix will motivate the salesperson and focus their activities\nto realize the corporation\u2019s objectives.\nMOTIVATING SALESPEOPLE\nDue to the day-to-day stress placed on the salesperson, morale can\nquickly plummet. Astute managers can boost morale and conse-\nquently boost performance through a combination of repeated\nusage of positive reinforcement, changing the compensation struc-\nture, to improve the sense of commitment the salesperson has to\nthe company. For many salespeople compensation, that is to say\nmoney, is big motivator, though to be honest often it is more as a\nmarker of success as opposed to the money itself. At IBM the sales\nforce would largely act like a school of fish that moves as if one,\nwhen we heard there was a bonus for a particular product we would\nall go out and try very hard to sell that particular product. At a\ndeeper level this suggests that many salespeople have a particularly\nhigh need for achievement and just find pleasure in the act of\nsucceeding on a regular basis.\nEVALUATING SALESPEOPLE\nWhile the simplest way to evaluate a salesperson is to compare their\nsales results with the metrics utilized to evaluate performance, how\ndoes a manager evaluate a salesperson during the selling process?\nOne method is to receive progress reports from each sales-\nperson, detailing their completed activities, calls they\u2019ve made,\nexpenses they\u2019ve accrued to date. With this information the\nmanager remains informed as to which companies have been\ncontacted, and the status of each account. The manager now has at\nhis or her disposal the needed information to compare the progress\nof each account, and can intervene directly if a sale is taking too\nlong to close. In sales, results are the ultimate long-term measure.People114", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2106, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b3eb9fe-d3e3-4ddc-9fb8-0ac52ff92cac": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b3eb9fe-d3e3-4ddc-9fb8-0ac52ff92cac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b067de83-3c48-45c4-b94b-5d2584ce7ac6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "be48d1006bf39251d9d06868ab13aad0764581459674fceb5cc8c27526ea57de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a25ad67d-bc83-411e-af46-31714356ca0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "1879badd2a6502249ea146156e619491799cbea705a708927358a6c4e59510d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10d5ab7f-20ce-44dc-b90c-b8bf59880cd2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c047f365ce9f49c768ba7eb3e79ca453ab2ee273fb0e2106488444b91a02093", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE SELLING PROCESS\nWe now turn to the selling process, a methodology that the sales-\nperson follows in order to close a sale. The personal selling process\nconsists of seven parts: prospecting, pre-approaching, approaching,\nthe sales call, closing (part of the sales call) and following up.\nPROSPECTING\nThe first step in the selling process is called prospecting.\nProspecting involves devising a list of qualified customers who\nwould be receptive to a marketing offer, at this point they are merely\nsuspects. Finding the right customers saves resources and avoids the\npossibility of building a client base whose needs and wants are diffi-\ncult to satisfy.\nAlthough the company can provide leads on prospective sales\nopportunities, capable salespeople generate new business by them-\nselves. Asking existing clients for referrals, trolling telephone\ndirectories and searching the Internet are just some of the methods\none can use to find the names and contact information of potential\nclients. The truly bold salesperson engages in a practice known as\ncold-calling, which involves calling or visiting the offices of a\nprospect unannounced. This is psychologically challenging.\nSalespeople spend months calling hundred of firms; most lead to\nnothing. We have a name for salespeople that thrive in this\nhothouse atmosphere, hunters. They are in contrast to farmers who\nprefer to work with existing customers and till them to get addi-\ntional business for their firms. Both are valuable but generally\nhunters are more rare and are paid more because of the value of\nbrand new customers and the sheer difficulty of bringing them in.\nOnce a list of potential customers has been drawn up, the sales-\nperson must screen out those that offer the least potential. You may\nwish to picture a funnel, at the wide end is a large number of suspects\nat the narrow bit there is relatively small number of customers who\nactually buy substantially. The job of sales is to turn the large\nmajority of suspects into customers, along the way a salesperson\nqualifies who should move to the next phase of the funnel. The\nfurther down the funnel you get the more expensive it is. Only\ncustomers who are really interested should be allowed to move\nthe next level of higher marketing spend.

Learning this type of discipline is one of the hardest\nlessons for budding marketers.\nPRE-APPROACHING\nHaving established a list of qualified customers, the salesperson\nthen starts the second stage of the selling process, which is called\nthe pre-approach. The pre-approach stage entails researching infor-\nmation about the prospect: What are their needs? How large is the\ncompany? Who are their existing suppliers? Who is the person (or\npeople) that approves a purchase? To learn about the prospective\nclient, the salesperson can consult their personal contacts, industry\nand online sources, and analysts.\nAPPROACHING\nArmed with enough background information, the seller can devise\na sales strategy as to which method is best to approach the\nprospec tive client. The seller should decide if a letter or a phone call\nwill be sufficient, or if a personal visit is needed to begin a rela-\ntionship. First impressions are vitally important in building\ngoodwill between the two parties. The more favourable impression\nthe seller makes, the more favourable the buyer will be to make a\npurchase.\nThe next three parts, presenting, objection handling and closing\ncan best be summarized as part of a professional sales call.\nTHE PROFESSIONAL SALES CALL\nWhen done well a professional sales call is a pleasure for a\ncustomer. A key starting point is to realize that most salespeople\nspend much too much time talking and nowhere near enough time\nlistening. When you think of the typical used car or electronics\nstore salesperson we cannot help but think of them as a non-stop\ntalker, this is exactly wrong.

Keeping this in mind let\u2019s go through a\nprofessional sales call.\nThe starting portion of a sales call is a critical bit and one not to\nbe short-changed. It is the rapport building stage. The fundamental\nthought is that people buy from people they like, now that does\nnot mean that you can cheat them, offer them a terrible price or\notherwise not be on the ball. But it is a fundamental truth for the\nvast majority of human beings, buying is a social and emotional\nprocess. For most buyers sitting and having a coffee or other\nculturally relevant beverage and having a pleasant chat about foot-\nball (US or the rest-of-the-world type), or baseball or cricket or\nwhat have you, is quite a nice change in their day. Most great\nsalespeople learn to ask for a coffee or water in order to make room\nfor social chit chat with the customer or potential customer as a\nway of building the start of the relationship of trust and liking.\nIndeed in the Middle East drinking a warm coffee or tea is essential\nbecause it is considered good manners. For someone you have not\nmet before this also critical because during the first five minutes,\npeople\u2019s impressions are being formed; if it is a pleasant and posi-\ntive one that positive image will remain for a long time. This\nhuman-to-human exchange will last at least a few minutes, a good\nsalesperson engages in light chit-chat and treats small talk as an\nimportant skill. Almost always the customer will signal when it is\nover and it is time to move onto business. They do this by clearing\ntheir throats and falling silent, by picking up a file from their desk\nand straightening it, or by saying explicitly, \u201clet\u2019s now do our busi-\nness\u201d, though in slightly less direct words. A few customers will\nallow the rapport stage to go on forever if you let them. A wise\nsalesperson will themselves end this part of the sales call eventu-\nally by saying, with considerable reluctance in their voice, \u201cI would\nlove nothing better than to chat about Man United all day . . . but\nmy boss\u201d and then shrug their shoulders to show that they sadly\nmust talk about business.\nThe next phase is a brief one, here the salesperson gives their\nInitialBenefitStatement(IBS). The IBS is a short statement saying\nwhy you are there and asking the person if that is of interest. Why\nyou ask if your visit is of interest is to get their permission to\ncontinue. We will do this throughout the sales call. It is similar to\ntacking a hallway carpet.

A good sales call is similar. You want the customer to\nfeel that each step of the call is a next logical step, that is not a reach\nbut rather is perfectly sensible, they don\u2019t feel manipulated but are\nrather in full agreement with the salesperson. We will check back\nwith the customer throughout our professional sales call. After the\ncustomer has agreed that why you are there is relevant for them\nyou then move to the next phase. If the customer doesn\u2019t agree that\nwhat you are there to discuss is for them, you then question and\nfind out why. You will often find that it is just a misunderstanding;\nonce you clear that up you may proceed but sometimes you may\nfind that you are meeting with the wrong person.

Outstanding salespeople realize that you should next move\ninto the heart of the sales call, questioning the customer about their\nneeds. This will often take up the majority of the time of the sales\ncall. During this phase the salesperson asks the customer about how\nthey are solving the problem that he/she wants to address with\ntheir product today. This interested probing will allow the sales-\nperson to understand the context of the customer and what is\nimportant to them. This will go on for 15, 20, 30 minutes or more\ndepending on the customer and the topic. At the end of the ques-\ntioning stage the salesperson will then summarize what they have\nlearned. This will encourage the customer that you have actually\nlistened (an unusual thing for most of us and rather enjoyable) and\nthen you check back with them that you have accurately reflected\nyour discussion.

The decisionmakerwho actually decides but is influenced by\nothers and so does not decide on his/her own. Influencers are\npeople who don\u2019t decide but have important input to the decision.\nFinancial people may have input in terms of the impact of the deal\non the organization\u2019s cash flow or ability to improve profitability.\nUser managers will undoubtedly have an opinion on whether the\nnew equipment is easier to work with than the older generation of\nequipment. Technical people often act as gatekeeperswho get to say\nwho you may buy from based on an approved set of vendors but\ncannot insist on one above another. Finally senior executives may\ntake a different view based on the strategy of the organization,\nalmost always strategy trumps the thinking of people lower in the\norganization. The task of the sales rep is clear, make sure they\nunderstand the varying agendas of each key influencer and tailor\ntheir approach to align their product with the agendaof each of\nthose key players. Easier said than done but quite critical.\nDuring the sales call the customer will generally have objections\nin their mind. Throughout the presentation, the salesperson should\nbe ready to answer whatever queries or objections the customer\nmight have. This is called objectionhandling. Having a well-trained\nand knowledgeable staff improves the salesperson\u2019s ability in\nhandling. The salesperson should also probe the customer from\ntime to time, when they look quizzical or confused by what we are\nsaying. If an objection lays unaddressed in the customer\u2019s mind we\nhave left a seed which will almost certainly germinate into a deal\nkiller, that is why good salespeople are quite happy to hear objec-\ntions. It is better that you hear them and deal with them than they\nare left unanswered.

If you hear a new objection that you don\u2019t have an\nanswer to the best course is to cheerfully admit that and tell the\ncustomer that you will get back them later. Honesty really is the\nbest policy, otherwise you will get in trouble and hurt that most\nvaluable thing, trust.\nCLOSING\nOnce all of the prospect\u2019s objections have been dealt with, the sales-\nperson attempts to close the sale by asking for an order. Though\nmost people find that rather intimidating it generally comes as no\nsurprise to the customer, they expect salespeople to ask for the\norder and are not upset when you do. If you have made a logic sales\ncall it should naturally flow from the conversation you have been\nhaving. For many sales an order will not result from the first call,\nbut every sales call should have an objective, an ambitious but real-\nistic target. For example, to obtain permission to call on another\nperson in the buying centre, to visit a customer reference site or\nthat you return with some financial analysis done which you will\nthen jointly review. However, the moment of truth will hopefully\narrive \u2013 asking for that valuable thing, the point of the salesperson\u2019s\nbusiness life, the order.\nKnowing when to close the sale is more of an art then a science.\nSlight nods of the head, the types of comments and questions from\nthe prospect are subtle but telling clues as to the seriousness of the\nbuyer. Once the salesperson feels the time is right to close, there are\na number of techniques they can employ. They can fill out an order\nfor the prospect, remind the buyer that waiting will likely mean\nthey will lose the order, or offer incentives, such as a lower price, or\nextra quantities. The aim is to instil a sense of urgency in the\nbuyer\u2019s mind to make a purchase immediately.\nFOLLOWING-UP\nThe last step in the selling process is the follow-up. The follow-up\nis essential to the selling process if the salesperson wants to retain\nthe customer for future business. Following-up entails contacting\nthe client, asking them for feedback regarding their order.People 121", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b8d5805-d1ab-4d18-b309-f860897c9b37": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b8d5805-d1ab-4d18-b309-f860897c9b37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cca866dc-1a83-4653-8093-43c4fdfb2751", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "cdc0b2b0a3a13b3eca973f219d98ffff43940e75e0b6ed0c9b937ac8ad23f106", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "396fbb91-ad7a-4adf-a8ae-dedf82346373", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "3f004cdc7ff274252264b9ef514af9457097fff2e3edc205b7cc92897c9243f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13dd5358-48bd-425c-be97-78d69ddfc64f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03a34beb9fe2650e92196b9c0a78e335952a9bd9ae473df610a22dcff504a850", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DIRECT MARKETING\nOne of the fastest growing segments in the marketing industry is the\ndirect marketing industry. We define directmarketingas a marketing\nstrategy to build stronger, more personal relationships between the\nbuyer and selected customers directly. In other words, there are no\nintermediary promotion or distribution channels between the buyer\nand seller. Direct marketing entails providing a marketing offer specif-\nically tailored to the needs or wants of a narrowly defined segment.\nIf the offer is flexible enough, it is theoretically possible to capture the\nentire consumer surplus with a direct marketing strategy; individuals\nreceive exactly what they want. To offer such products, direct\nmarketers need large databases containing information on their\ncustomers, information that includes demographic, psychographic,\ngeographic and behavioural data. Using statistics, analysts uncover\nsimilar preferences between dissimilar customers, enabling the direct\nmarketer to craft a marketing offer to the under-served segment.\nDirect marketing deepens the relationship between buyer and seller.\nDirect marketing is by no means a new phenomenon. The\nretailing giant Sears Roebuck started as a catalogue company over\n100 years ago. Sears became a success because they directly inter-\nacted with the customer, always fulfilling their marketing offer,\nwhich was to deliver affordable clothing to the customer\u2019s home in\na timely fashion.\nBENEFITS OF DIRECT MARKETING\nEmploying a direct marketing model offers many benefits to buyers\nand sellers. For the buyers, direct marketing is a quick, and conven-\nient means of purchasing goods they want. Direct marketing also\nfacilitates the possibility of customizing the order, therefore the\nbuyers receive the product they want, not the product marketers\nthink they want. For sellers, direct marketing is also beneficial. By\noffering consumers products that they want, the seller can capture\nmore of the consumer surplus. Second, by directly contacting the\nconsumer, the marketer does not need to build a retail presence to\nreach customers. Third, direct marketing allows the marketer to craft\nmarketing offers specifically targeted to a small group or even an\nindividual buyer.People122", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2237, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13dd5358-48bd-425c-be97-78d69ddfc64f": {"__data__": {"id_": "13dd5358-48bd-425c-be97-78d69ddfc64f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fd284c6-f431-45d2-9c53-1318cafb386e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "1b9e7322e6b407f3f9c1ae9ce140f00da0cf289706a067304f42c294fa54630e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b8d5805-d1ab-4d18-b309-f860897c9b37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "cdc0b2b0a3a13b3eca973f219d98ffff43940e75e0b6ed0c9b937ac8ad23f106", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf5482f7-d12c-4e47-bfd2-f65b06092e17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "65ab4f7287129bfd737dae157459286f5ef4439713df40ea3c85c6413223a265", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "FORMS OF DIRECT MARKETING\nThere are seven forms of direct marketing: personal selling, online\nmarketing, telephone marketing, direct-mail marketing, catalogue\nmarketing, direct-response television marketing, and kiosk marketing.\nWe take a look at a few.\nTELEPHONE MARKETING\nTelephonemarketingis a cost-effective way of reaching a customer\nrelative to conventional channels. In previous chapters we\u2019ve\ndemonstrated the high cost and difficulty of getting a message\nthrough to a customer, whereas only those that wish to be undis-\nturbed will ignore a ringing telephone. Also, the cost of setting up a\ntelephone marketing operation is considerably lower than adver-\ntising in the media. Buying a 60 second advertisement slot on a\nmajor network can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, whereas\nthe direct marketer only needs a toll-free telephone number. With a\ntoll-free number, the marketer gains access to the entire region\nwhere the number services. By offering customers the chance to\nmake a purchase immediately, is it any wonder why telephone\nmarketing is one of the most popular forms of direct marketing,\naccounting for almost 35% of all direct marketing sales?\nDIRECT MAIL MARKETING\nDirect-mailmarketingis the second most popular form of direct\nmarketing, accounting for 30% of all direct marketing sales. Direct-\nmail marketing entails sending a marketing offer to a prospective\ncustomer residing in a particular geographic region. Messages can\ntravel through the mail, Internet or through the telephone system\nin the form of a fax or voicemail. Whichever medium is chosen, the\nmessage sent to the customer will be customized to their wants, as\ndetermined by the database that contains their information. A crit-\nical success factor is the quality of the mailing list; firms exist which\nprovide, for a price, mailing lists, though the quality of their lists\nvaries. Though many people in the developed world don\u2019t like direct\nmail and trash virtually all they receive, for the right person at the\nright time the right direct mail piece is right on.

Accounting for almost $200 billion in worldwide sales,\ncatalogue marketing is similar to direct mail marketing with one\nnotable exception: unlike in direct-mail marketing where the person\ncontacted is a prospective customer, in catalogue marketing the\nseller already knows the buyer is interested. Visitors to the Sears\ndepartment store, volunteer their mailing address in order to\nreceive the catalogue. LL Bean is a Maine based company which has\ndone extremely well not only in North America but enjoying\nconsiderable success in the UK as well as Britons get used to the\nidea of ordering something that they cannot see.

Dell, Neiman Marcus and General Electric are all examples\nof big, prestigious firms which have used catalogue marketing with\nconsiderable success.\nDIRECT-RESPONSE TELEVISION MARKETING\nJust as there\u2019s a telephone in nearly every home, the same can be\nsaid about the television set. As such, it didn\u2019t take long for\nmarketers to start devising means of connecting to customers\nthrough the airwaves. What emerged was direct-response television\nmarketing.\nThere are two forms of direct television marketing. The first is\nthe infomercial, the second is cable television shopping. The\ninfomercial is a 60 to 90 minute staged demonstration of the adver-\ntised product. Viewers watch how the product fares when subjected\nto a number of field tests. Other infomercials which late-night tele-\nvision watchers may recognize, suggest if one were to call at that\nmoment, the somewhat attractive member of the opposite sex seen\non the screen will be sitting on the other end of the telephone.\nDespite their seemingly comical advertisements, consumers in the\nUS spend $2 billion each year on products advertised on television.People124", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2096, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "896b9343-adb2-433e-a14d-b14e28051814": {"__data__": {"id_": "896b9343-adb2-433e-a14d-b14e28051814", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7802e980-eaee-4c48-ac2e-ec3bed68513e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "b8e3a1b8dcf9dd79ef34d7b2bb5c420488611ae23c3a37a16ee6c7cce5bef289", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf5482f7-d12c-4e47-bfd2-f65b06092e17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "47709a8adba524a1c18947ce2d19feb6e848ed9855370051430d27d711d1de97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8e9c28e-11ed-4319-aa39-ced5971e6c88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a2ad811076baced813f7938902197b574e706326a198321af681d7baed11935", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The second form of direct television marketing is cable television\nshopping.

Advertisers\npay the content provider a fee to list their product at the time when\ntheir target market will be watching. Like the infomercial, cable\ntelevision shopping channels bring in billions.\nKIOSK MARKETING\nThe final method of direct marketing is called kiosk marketing.\nKiosk marketing entails placing a mobile stand in a place where the\ncustomer is most likely to be. The kiosk may be manned by one or\ntwo people, or could simply be a touch screen that displays informa-\ntion. The level of interaction between customer and seller in kiosk\nmarketing is generally low because they are used primarily to gather\nor disseminate information. Examples of kiosks include, Eddie Bauer\nstores where customers can order from the entire line of products\nsome of which are not available in the retail store and Florsheim Shoe\nkiosks placed in airports for home or office delivery.

However,\nthey believe the cost to society is greater than those realized. Because\ncompanies understand the importance of retaining customers for\nthe long-term, direct marketers are especially aggressive in\ntargeting impulse or less-sophisticated clients: dinner time phone\ncalls, nearly deafening television commercials advertising incredu-\nlous savings, or claims of large prizes awaiting. Furthermore, the\namount of waste direct marketing generates is considerable. Too\noften consumers throw promotional material into the garbage, fed\nup with their mailboxes being stuffed full with advertisements. A\nlot of trees were cut down for no benefit to society.

A third way to build customer value and satisfac-\ntion is by employing a well-trained and knowledgeable support\nstaff whose activities are designed around satisfying customers.\nTake the airline industry for example. Before boarding a plane, the\ntraveller presents their boarding pass to the checkout counter, is\nseated by an air-steward, is taken to their destination by a pilot, and\nfinally receives their bags placed on the carousel by baggage\nhandlers. Though the consumer may not be aware of the \u201cbehind\nthe scenes\u201d activities when they are working well, they certainly\nwill notice when mistakes are made.

Marketsegmentationis the practice of\ndividing a large heterogeneous market into smaller subgroups with\nshared characteristics in order to deliver a market offering that\nsatisfies unmet needs as closely as possible. Since those within a\nsegment have similar characteristics, marketers have found they\nrespond similarly to a marketing strategy promoting a given\nproduct, at a certain price that is distributed in a particular fashion.\nA central idea is that you can adjust the five levers of the\nmarketing mix (our friends the 5 Ps) to more carefully align with\nthe things that that segment or group prefer in your product class.\nThis makes the product more suited to their needs than a generic\nproduct for the \u201caverage consumer\u201d.

These units can represent nations, provinces,\ncounties, cities, neighbourhoods, streets and even individual addresses.\nThere are firms in the US, Canada, the UK and other countries that\nwill sell you data based on census data at the level of a postal code.\nIn Canada this means a few houses or an apartment building, a\nrather narrow focus. Geographic segmentation provides companies\nwith the opportunity to tailor their products to suit the tastes and\npreferences of a unique region. In the Basque regions of Spain, resi-\ndents speak Catalan as their first language, not Spanish.

Demographic segmentation is by\nfar the most popular means of segmentation because they have\ntraditionally been highly correlated to consumption patterns,\nmeaning demographic variables have been very good at predicting\nconsumer behaviour. Today, the predictive power of demographic\ndata is not as effective as in the past. For example, the role of women\nhas dramatically evolved in many industrialized countries in the\nlast generation. In the past a women\u2019s age and marital status were\nstrong predictors of whether she had borne children. Today, women\nare having their families later in life; a new mum can be anywhere\nfrom her 20s to her mid-40s and due to the wonders of in-vitro\nfertilization, even older. Though demographic segmentation is still\nwidely used we should realize that as society change, demographic\nsegmentation loses some of their predictive power.

It is\nthis worldview which marketers have got to get their heads around\nin order to successfully tailor their message to each generation. For\nexample if you are trying to sell luxury with the seniors you may\nwish to stress the fact that the luxury good is the best buy because\nit lasts the longest and you will be able to pass it onto one of your\ngrandchildren in your will.

Xers tend to roll their\neyes at the Boomers showing off so you point out how it is a\nprivate indulgence for them. One bugbear we have is that too many\nmarketers are too youth oriented. For some products catering to\nthis demographic is vital. For example podcasts seem to be reserved\nto the youth oriented world. That said, not every new web tool is\nthe exclusive domain of teens.

This study helps\ndraw a picture of blog readers that is very different from what\nmany had previously pictured.\nWe think that marketers are overly focused on the young and\nshould spend much more time targeting the boomers. There are a\nlot of them, the number of older people is growing and they have\nthe money.

Typically\nmarketers divide the market into heavy, medium and light users.\nHeavy users, generally speaking, are the smallest group a marketer\nserves, but they are the most profitable. Promoting a small\npercentage of medium users into heavy users will dramatically\naffect the bottom line. It is the commonly quoted 80/20 rule, where\n80% of your sales come from 20% of your customers, a rule which\nholds in an amazing number of markets.\nPRODUCT END USE\nAnother method of segmenting a market is to identify the current\nstatus of the consumer. Marketers normally group customers into\nthe following categories: regular users, first-time users, former\nusers, competitive users, and non-users. Regular users are the most\nvaluable and contribute the most to profit. The challenge with first-\ntime users is to make it such a positive experience that they will be\nconverted to become regular users. Former users are of considerable\ninterest. A starting place is to ask why did they leave? There are\ngood reasons and poor reasons. A good reason might be that your\nproduct is no longer relevant, they have moved to a different city or\nhave retired, a poor reason is that you dropped the ball on the\ncustomer service front. Poor reasons are ones you should try to\nsolve and win back their business. Users of your competitors\u2019\nproduct are of great interest. After your own users they are a crit-\nical target. The great advantage is that they are already users of\nyour product\u2019s category and believe that it is relevant to their lives;\nwhat you must do is figure out why they buy from your\ncompetitor and not you.

Knowing what the\ncustomer thinks about the product, greatly aids in crafting the promo-\ntional message.\nOCCASIONS\nFinally, grouping buyers according to the occasions for when a\nproduct is purchased or consumed is another means of dividing a\nmarket to learn more about a consumer\u2019s behaviour. With this\nknowledge, a marketer can modify the marketing mix to encourage\na change in consumption patterns. An interesting example is the\nmarketing done by DeBeers of South Africa about diamonds. A\nnumber of years ago they ran ads offering the advice that a man\nshould spend 2 months salary when buying an engagement ring for\nhis beloved. Men, not knowing better, accepted this advice from a\ntruly biased source and this has become widely accepted in the US.\nA more recent campaign makes the point that if your wife stuck\naround with you for 25 years the least you can do is buy her\nanother diamond ring. Again, men, not knowing better accepted\nthis advice from a well and truly biased source. Their latest\ncampaign in Japan is targeted at getting single women to realize\nthat they can buy a nice diamond ring on their own, they don\u2019t\nneed a man and use a attractive, single Japanese female movie star\nas the their spokeswoman.

Each method-\nology we have discussed has certain advantages and disadvantages.\nBy using a combination of approaches, the marketer gains insight\non the different dimensions of their customers. Oversegmentation\ncan occur, which is when a marketer unnecessarily segments the\nmarket. Just because consumers express the desire to have products\nmore closely tailored to fit their needs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\nwon\u2019t purchase the product altogether, the key principle to keep in\nmind as they only adjust the levers of the marketing mix upward if\nit will result in more revenue than the cost incurred.\nTARGETING THE MARKET\nChoosing your targetmarketis the process of evaluating each\nsegment\u2019s attractiveness and choosing which one or ones to go after.\nWhich markets to enter depends on the corporate strategy and the\ncompany\u2019s resources. One of the hardest things to do for many\nmarketers is to choose their target segments and stick with them,\nignoring other segments. Learning to say \u201cno\u201d is very hard but is\ncritical because any firm, even the largest, have only limited\nresources.\nEVALUATING MARKET SEGMENTS\nWhen evaluating to which segments to offer a product, a firm\nconsiders three factors: the size and growth opportunities, the existing\nindustrial structure and the company\u2019s objectives and capabilities. The\ncompany collects and analyses data on each segment, calculating the\ncurrent sales, projected growth rates and expected profit levels.\nThose that meet the company\u2019s size and growth requirements are\nthen placed under closer scrutiny. At this stage, the investigator\nanalyses the capabilities of the competition, the buying power of\nsuppliers, the buying power of buyers, the availability of substi-\ntutes. In other words, a segment must undergo a Porter Analysis.SEGMENTATION, TARGETING AND POSITIONING142", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1996, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e14b146-6661-40a5-b8c9-c1afde16a999": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e14b146-6661-40a5-b8c9-c1afde16a999", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cf872ff-87b5-46a8-8e4e-9be90d6414cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "2fd118627d534a151bb3470c1506be9992e2d914ebbe8b77af5c592bf2e0ce5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4e5750e-2562-4342-8757-563e778692a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "b1161d7ed34e0c863ab403c7d501091c6b8073aa10227551f0b886f67db2a4a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8590be65-67a3-4824-a42a-d624d69ca00c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fcbdce1700db74d2e0cad6437f004f9fb65df69a4e319bc6b963705a72bdd7cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Lastly, if a segment is of the right size and growth potential, as well\nas having a favourable industrial structure, the company must\nconsider their corporate objectives and capabilities.

To win in a\nsegment, a firm must offer superior value over the existing alterna-\ntives.\nSELECTING TARGET MARKET SEGMENTS\nOnce the firm decides which segment or segments to serve, they\nhave five entry strategies: single-segment concentration, selective\nspecialization, product specialization, market specialization and full-\nmarket coverage\nSINGLE-SEGMENT CONCENTRATION\nIn this strategy, the vendor decides to target only one segment, and\nconcentrate all their efforts into capturing a leadership position.

Vendors with a full product-\nline are capable of undertaking a full-market coverage strategy. The\nvendor can choose to pursue an undifferentiated approach or a\ndifferentiated approach. Employing an undifferentiated approach\nentails treating different segments as one market. In other words,\nthe vendor tailors the marketing-mix to appeal to needs held in\ncommon between all segments. An undifferentiated approach is the\npolar opposite of a differentiated approach. This strategy entails\ndesigning a different product to each segment. Automobile manu-\nfacturers and increasingly, airline companies are employing a\ndifferentiated full-market coverage strategy.\nPOSITIONING\nWe now turn to positioning a product.

Product positioning entails differentiatinga\nproduct from competitors by highlighting important attributes and\nbenefits.\nCHOOSING A POSITIONING STRATEGY\nOne way to accomplish this is to create advertising that draws a\nmental map of the product\u2019s benefits in contrast to a competitor\u2019s\noffering. By contrasting a product\u2019s key features and benefits\nagainst the shortcomings of the competition, the customer will\ncreate a mental map in their mind differentiating the advertised\nproduct from the competition.\nIn today\u2019s world, people in consumerist societies are bombarded\nwith thousands of images each and every day.

Product ladders are a mental ranking\nsystem, except, once a product has been accepted as the best in its\ncategory, it is very difficult for other products to displace it.

In 2005 the Hawaii\nTourism Board sought to reposition Hawaii in the mind of its\nsecond most important market, Japanese tourists. In the past it had\nused Hawaii Sumo wrestlers in their ads in Japan. In 2005 they\nlaunched ads using a hot young ukulele player, Jake Shimabukuro,\nto present a different positioning of Hawaii in Japanese minds.\nBeyond the cool of Jake they also used a new tag line, \u201cThe islands\nof Aloha\u201d.

Auditing the actual\ncustomer experience to see how it measures is something an increasing\nnumber of firms are doing. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the five\npoints of contact that can be a possible source of competitive advan-\ntage.\nPRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION\nThe actual product provides a great degree of latitude when it comes\nto differentiation. The manufacturer can adjust the form of the\nproduct by modifying the shape, size or structure of the product to\ndifferentiate it from other products. A second source of product\ndifferentiation is to add (or remove) additional features to the product.\nWhat an increasing number of firms find is that after several years\nof adding features they do well by introducing a slimmed down\nbasic product which appeals those with less complex needs and to\nbudget conscious consumers. Telephone companies are finding this,\nas they add Call Waiting, Call Answer, Caller ID, etc., that there\nexists a substantial market which only wants basic phone service, be\nit landline or cellular. A third would be to attain a consistent level of\nquality. Fast food is by no means the healthiest of meals.\nMcDonald\u2019s strategy is to consistently deliver low priced, quality\nfood. A key part of their value proposition is that it will be very\npredictable what you will get. Pre-MacDonald\u2019s when you travelled\nyou never were sure what surprises, unpleasant or perhaps\npleasant, the local \u201cgreasy spoon\u201d held in store. When you see a\nMacDonald\u2019s in Peoria, Illinois, Pretoria, South Africa or Perth,\nAustralia you know that it will be a familiar menu, remind you of\nhome, regardless of where you are from and will please the chil-\ndren.\nA fourth source of differentiation is to create a product with high\ndurability. A fifth is creating a product that is reliable over the\nproduct\u2019s life. In case the vendor focuses on the cost of ownership,\nthat is costs not only of buying the product, called Capital expendi-\nture (CAPEX) but also installing (IMPEX) and operating (OPEX) it.\nIn the case of the infrastructure of cell stations necessary to run a\nnational cellphone network, the cost of maintenance or operating it\nmay be equal to the cost of buying it over a ten-year period.

Simplifying the ordering process or\noffering delivery services are two such methods. Air Canada has\nsimplified the buying process for many of their customers by\nreducing from hundreds of potential fares for a flight to just 5,\nthey have also moved online and eliminated the need for paper\ntickets in the vast majority of cases. Providing installation and\nmaintenance expertise are another two. Many high-tech firms will\nhave maintenance personal located at their key customer\u2019s site in\norder to cut travel time to zero, resulting in great service and\nreduced downtime for their customer . Customer training programs\nand providing after- sales service also leaves a positive impression in\nthe customer\u2019s mind.\nPERSONNEL DIFFERENTIATION\nCompanies can differentiate themselves by hiring highly trained\nand knowledgeable staff. Their employees\u2019 overall competence,\ncourtesy, reliability, responsiveness, communication skills and their\ntrustworthiness all factor in the differentiation process. Part of\nIBM\u2019s advertising campaign is to feature some members of a\nproduct team.

The computer industry is very competitive and because of\nthe ubiquity of computers, it has many of the characteristics of a\ncommodity market. Because margins are extremely thin, cost-\nsavings have a dramatic effect on the bottom line.\nDell was one of the first companies to pioneer the idea of mass-\ncustomization, where the manufacturer offers a basic skeleton and the\ncustomer selects the parts.

In this section\nwe define what a brand is and suggest some ways brands can be\neffectively used. The American Marketing Association defines a\nbrand as \u201ca name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of\nthem, intended to identify the goods, or services of one seller or\ngroup of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competi-\ntors\u201d. A brand then, is a product or service that adds dimensions\nthat differentiate it, in some way relevant for the customer, from\nother products designed to satisfy the same name. The differences\nmay be functional, rational or tangible, that is related to the product\nperformance of the brand. They may also be symbolic, emotional or\nintangible, that is related to what the brand represents in the mind\nof the consumer.\nBranding is hardly a new thing. Marketing historians have\ntraced back the first brands to Ancient Greece. One of the key\nindustries in that day was the pottery industry. The industry\ncatered almost exclusively to consumer demand. The entrepreneurs\nthat catered to this nascent consumer market were mostly\ncraftsmen who quickly responded to economic incentives and pres-\nsures. Modern archaeologists have traced different pots to their\nrespective makers and workshops by grouping the designs the\npotter used. Strong evidence shows that by the 6th century BCE,\npotters mostly from Corinth, were producing pots targeted to\nspecific markets stretching from Spain to the Black Sea. Athenian\npotters, locked out of the niche markets by more responsive\nCorinthian competitors, appear to have chosen a mass-market\napproach, producing vessels of a lesser artistic quality destined for\nforeign markets. Eventually they realized that in markets that\noffered consumers a variety of choices, a differentiation strategy\nwas needed to separate their product from other competitors.\nBranding was born.\nAs early as the 7th century BCE the potters of Euboea began to\nlabel their work. This practice spread to Athens and Corinth in the\nfollowing century. Sophilos appears to be the first Athenian potter\nto identify his own work; around the top of his vases he sometimes\netched images of the Gods of Athens. Another craftsman, Euthymides,\nbragged on one of his creations that his vase was of a higher quality\nthan those of Euphronios, the first example we have found of \u201cslag-SEGMENTATION, TARGETING AND POSITIONING156", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2437, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52be8403-7607-4018-8b4a-5cebbe23d1a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "52be8403-7607-4018-8b4a-5cebbe23d1a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3cf6d978-d5e8-4396-92b4-9a43aecfd046", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "4dcd96e3449f54b2182ba0174b1b4d11b06e818c010984f55de1008c672a4df6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88cf08fd-878e-4ea0-9ca8-551704b39ab6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "156", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "48e3b4252e981fa221cce538a179d87dc3abcb393cf10b9ecea71562e894f7e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "17a5fb83-56c1-464a-ac91-65edf45bfe22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "384e0cb67023819beec6026a8b94666e7e23c0b9aacea6ccceafba4445addbf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ging off\u201d a competitor! The potter\u2019s signature, suggests both a pride\nin his product and a desire to attract future orders.\nOnce branding became prevalent, advertising claims soon\nfollowed. A motto on a cup imported to Italy from Rhodes may be\nthe first recorded commercial advertisement. It read, \u201cNestor had a\nmost drink-worthy cup, but whoever drinks of mine will straightaway\nbe smitten with the desire of fair-crowned Aphrodite\u201d. Who can\nresist the desires of the Goddess of Love? Even in Ancient Greece,\nsex sells.\nBrands have evolved to be something much more important and\ncomplex. Brands identify the source of a product and allow\ncustomers, whether consumer or organizations, to value the product\ndifferently because of the source. Customers learn about brands by\npast experience with the product. They learn to value some brands\nmore than others. At the heart of this is ability of brands to\nsimplify our buying in a hectic and time starved world and reduce\nrisk by the promise of quality that a brand delivers. When we buy a\nRalph Lauren polo shirt we realize that we could spend less money\nbut the polo horse on the shirt means that we bought a good\nquality shirt, it reduces our risk of buying. It also makes our search\nfor that new shirt that much easier, we don\u2019t have to go from shop\nto shop endlessly comparing goods to find one that we will feel\ncomfortable with. It also may give us \u201cstreet cred\u201d or social status\namong other people. These are three of the key advantages of\nbrands to the customer.\nWhere do brands apply? In virtually every category. It is possible\nto brand a physical good, a service (British Airways, Bank of Tokyo)\na store (Nike, Holt Renfrew), a person (John Grisham, Philip\nKotler) a place (the Lake District, Niagara Falls) an organization or\nan idea (British Automobile Association, UNICEF).\nBrands can be both repositioned and rejuvenated. We gave an\nexample of repositioning a few pages ago with the example of the\nrepositioning of Hawaii in the Japanese market. Rejuvenating a\nbrand can be critical to breathing life back in a brand which may\nhave become burnished over time. A recent good example of this\nis the way the hot selling Razor Cellphone has added gleam to\nMotorola\u2019s reputation for innovative and beautifully designed\nproducts. The Razor, in case you have not seen one, is a super\nthin, or at least by previous standards super thin, cellphone.

To help us understand this contra-\ndiction, we can usefully divide the world into two types of products\n(marketers love to divide the world into two!), low and high involve-\nment. Low involvement goods , Coke in the previous example, are\nones which we don\u2019t think much about, we don\u2019t search for addi-\ntional information, we generally buy on autopilot and we rarely\nfeel buyer\u2019s remorse. They are generally regular repeat purchases\nand often are inexpensive. Once we settle on a choice we stick with\nit.High involvement goods , on the other hand tend to be infre-\nquent purchases, are often expensive and we actively seek out\ninformation in order to make a better decision. A house or car, for\nmost of us, are high involvement goods. An important aspect of\nhigh involvement goods from a marketer\u2019s viewpoint is that\nconsumers are more apt to experience buyers remorse with high\ninvolvement goods. It is part of most people\u2019s human nature that\nafter making an important decision is to wonder if we made a\nmistake. Clever marketers recognize this truth and often follow-up\nright after the sale or soon after with a message that reinforces the\nwisdom of the purchase in buying what they did. At IBM sales\nschool, sales agents are taught to take the customer to lunch after\nthey signed a multimillion-dollar computer contract. During the meal,\nthe agent reminds the client the reasons they bought the product to\nencourage the client to realize they did in fact make the right deci-\nsion. This may sound less than subtle but when done well it is quite\neffective. Research has shown that the most attentive viewers of\nnew car ads are people who just bought the same car \u2013 they are\nseeking reinforcement that they got it right!\nMODELS OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR\nHaving discussed the buyer decision process, we now turn our atten-\ntion to modelling consumer behaviour.

In general\nthey can be classified into two types: economic and psychological.\nEconomic models assume buyers seek to satisfy their needs by maxi-\nmizing the utility of their budget constraint. These buyers operate\nin conditions known as perfect information , which means all the\ninformation the buyer needs to make an informed decision is readily\navailable. Though information is freely available in this world, money\nis not. As such, buyers in economic models weigh the potential\nbenefits from various choices, and select those that maximize their\nutility . If the utility gained is more than expected, the customer is\ndelighted. If it is less however, they will be disappointed and will re-\nadjust the value they ascribe to that product for future references.\nWhile economic models provide satisfactory conclusions, the\nassumption of perfect information seems highly unlikely in prac-\ntice. What\u2019s more, believing people carefully rationalize every\ndecision is suspect; spontaneity is a human trait as well.\nPsychological models assume that there are many different types\nof consumers, each influenced by different cultural, social and personal\nfactors. Though more complex and harder to quantify, marketers\ngenerally prefer psychological models to explain consumer behaviour.\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nCultureaccording to the United Nations is the \u201cset of distinctive\nspiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a\nsocial group, and that it encompasses, in addition to art and literature,\nlifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and\nbeliefs\u201d. Since culture affects how a person sees and interacts with the\nworld, it is the most important determinant in any psychological\nmodel.\nSome of the key dimensions by which researchers understand\nculture are by the hierarchical distance in the society, that is the\ndistance between those of high status and those of lower status, and\nthe degree that the individual is important versus the group. Japan and\nAustralia differ quite considerably on these important ways of under-\nstanding a culture. In Japan hierarchy and your position in society is\nimportant, Australia on the other hand is much more informal and\nrelaxed, everyone is a \u201cmate\u201d.

One lesson that many\nhave learned is that they must hire people from that foreign culture\nto overcome cross-cultural differences. To complicate matters,\nwithin a national culture there are often distinct subcultures,\nQuebec in Canada is one example but even in the relatively homo-\ngeneous US market we can see that there are considerable cultural\ndifferences between New England, Texas, California and the Mid-\nWest. The divisions do not end there. Within urban centres, distinct\nethnic enclaves have emerged making it potentially difficult for\nmarketers to use standard messages. Wal-Mart quite famously\ncommitted a considerable faux pas when it entered Canada in the\n90s. Though a substantial percentage of the population speaks more\nthan two languages, Wal-Mart put out door-to-door advertising\nonly in English in Montreal, the second largest French speaking city\nin the world. Needless to say it took some years for Wal-Mart to\nwin the hearts of Francophones in Montreal.\nMarketers are always on the look out for shifts in cultural trends\nwithin a given country. During the 90s, consumers began to switch\nfrom fatty manufactured foods to low calorie and often organic\nfoods. As the trend persisted, food manufacturers changed their\nentire marketing mix to reflect this new reality. Food giant Frito\nLay for example launched a new version of their best selling potato\nchip using certified organic products and to reduce caloric content,\nused a baking process instead of deep-frying to prepare the food. To\nfurther separate the product from its unhealthier cousins, Baked\nLays are often found in the organic section of a grocery store. Kraft\nFoods is following a similar course. Kraft Foods continues to\ndevelop single serve portion choices for some of its popular cheese,\nchocolate and savoury snack products. They have also introduced\nNabisco 100 calorie packs, these are pre-portioned packages of Oreo\nThin Crisps, Chips Ahoy! Thin Crisps, Kraft Cheese Nips and\nWheat Thins Minis.

When cultural trends change direction, business follows.\nSOCIAL FACTORS\nPsychological models also take into account social factors. Unless a\nperson lives in total isolation, they belong to and are influenced by\na number of groups. A group is two or more people who interact\ntogether for a common purpose. Because people in a group share a\ncommon purpose, it is assumed that their purchasing decisions are\ninfluenced by the attitudes and opinions of the most important\npeople in the group. These opinion leaders are sometimes called\ninfluencers. Either with charisma, knowledge, special skills or a\ncombination of these and other factors, influencers exert a consider-\nable amount of sway on the opinions of the group. Marketers of\nconsumer goods woo influencers to adopt their products because\nthey are much more likely to convince imitatorsto also purchase\nthe item. Athletic clothing manufacturers generously sponsor high-\nprofile athletes because of their ability to influence tastes.\nBUZZ MARKETING\nIn recent years, marketers have engaged in a practice called buzz\nmarketingto woo imitators. Movies, books and CDs are all products\nwhich depend on a positive buzz to get people to buy them. Buzz\nmarketing entails recruiting influencers to talk positively about a\nproduct to their friends. Gaining the endorsement of influencers\ncreates with the masses, to use the official lingo, street cred. Buzz\nmarketing is not always as seditious as it sounds. Sometimes the\ninfluencer promotes the product without resorting to direct coer-\ncion of neophytes. For example, search engine giant Google is the\nmost successful company to date to successfully implement a buzz\nmarketing strategy without the need to recruit influencers. Their\nsearch engine became the market leader with no marketing budget\nwhatsoever because they successfully converted die hard Internet\nprogrammers into wilful promoters simply by offering a great\nproduct for fere and promising not to do evil. These individuals\npromoted the product to their peers and their friends for free.Market Research166", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2203, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a280e4c-3a1b-4571-9eb1-e73f5f19b5de": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a280e4c-3a1b-4571-9eb1-e73f5f19b5de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2813d9a6-3498-4d7a-8ca6-8284be28a4ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "15a99a3cb302d42b243e5964ed0d73a4600dbb3f4789e6a5049ba9b03bde0e73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c23bc35-a695-48a8-b76c-381cf1b54aed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "0aeff620517dae5e4852beb84af56eef884b0eaf441c3ad8e36e711646daa8ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef588bd6-fca6-477d-80b5-d8e5a79f0302", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e7dfe5a8ad453dedae9cd8bdc14610d61db5c3bd81beae7535d8d68a51f015c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CLASS STRUCTURE\nA society\u2019s class structure is another group that influences choices.\nThough it might not seem apparent in some countries, class divisions\nexist in every society because the relationship between owners of\nproduction and those who actually do the work is inherently different.\nSocial classes demonstrate distinct preferences when satisfying their\nneeds. Those in the upper classes favour expensive brand name items\nbecause they offer an element of prestige and exclusivity. Whereas\nthose in the lowest classes are extremely price sensitive. It is inter-\nesting to note that this may be changing. Unlike the past rich\nconsumers are shopping at both Wal-Mart and Nordstrom\u2019s. On\none hand, they want the cheap and cheerful offer of Wal-Mart for a\nsubstantial portion of their spending in order to save money and in\nconcert with more traditional behaviour the rich, who can afford,\nalso shop in top end shops.

Take volunteerism for example. Boomers tend to be self-\nabsorbed, more concerned with self-preservation than self-fulfilment,\nand are unable or unwilling to change the world. They are not\nwithout ambition or a sense of charity, but in their pursuit of self-\nfulfilment, career often crowds out family, and because volunteerism\noffers no serviceable rewards, it too is largely ignored. Meanwhile,\nNexters have adopted a starkly different point of view towards\nvolunteerism.

The aim of every quantitative study\nis to build a model that can predict the future with a high degree of\naccuracy. To start, the researcher must first observe a cause and\neffect relationship between two events. Let us assume a driver of an\nice cream van noticed hordes of children, the children chased after\nhim (driving at a very slow and safe speed of course) for blocks\non end when the temperature was above 25 degrees Celsius. Once\nhe stopped the van, a feeding frenzy would take place, as children\npractically begged him for larger sizes. However, when the tempera-\nture was cooler that 25 degrees, only those children who really\nwanted ice cream would make an effort. Leading the driver to\nconclude that the temperature is the difference between a bonanza\nand breaking even.\nIs the driver correct? That\u2019s what quantitative models set out to\nprove one way or another using the principles of statistics, which\nbelieves if you observe a phenomenon long enough patterns will\nemerge. These patterns fall under a certain number of categories\ncalled distributions. Choose the right distribution, you then can\naccurately predict outcomes.\nTo build a quantitative model, a researcher would first express\nthe relationship between ice cream sales and temperature mathe-\nmatically in the form of a nullhypothesis. A null hypothesis can\nbe expressed as an equality, inequality or as the difference between\ntwo samples. A null hypothesis is also assumed to be true unless\nproven otherwise. The reason why statisticians assume the null is\ntrue is because it is much easier to disprove truth than proving it.\nImagine you had an argument with a friend who claimed a partic-\nular fact was true. You had that sneaky suspicion in the back of your\nmind that perhaps your friend was stretching the truth. To see if\nthat is indeed the case, you went on the computer, conducted a search\non the Internet and discovered in fact your friend did misquote the\nfact. Statisticians love to disprove things as well, except they use\nmathematics.\nOnce the null hypothesis is stated, an appropriate test is\nchosen to determine the probability the null is indeed true.\nChoosing the test is not as difficult as it sounds.

Qualitative models are useful because they\nexplain to the marketer why things are the way they are (academics\nwould characterize them as normative), as opposed to quantitative\nmodels which are prescriptiveor describe how things should be.\nQuantitative research is done when you have a theory or one or\nmore hypothesis to test, qualitative takes place before you have a\ntheory, it is more exploratory, seeking to understand the broad\noutlines of a question. Thus, usually, qualitative studies are conducted\nfirst and then followed by a quantitative study to confirm the hypoth-\nesisgenerated from the qualitative study. The next section discusses\nsome of the more popular qualitative research methods.\nFOCUS GROUPS\nFocus groups are popular with marketers, especially when they\u2019re\ntrying to find out exactly what their customers\u2019 needs are. It entails\ninviting a small group of people (usually a group between 8 to 12)\nwho comprise a good representation of the target market. A moder-\nator then asks the group questions to discuss their opinions about\nhow the product satisfies or fails their needs. Once a discussion\nstarts, the moderator somewhat removes themselves from the discus-\nsion, letting the participants debate amongst themselves. From time\nto time the moderator interrupts to get the discussion back on track.\nThe session usually lasts for an hour, and is taped. Later, researchers\ntranscribe the event and analyse the text to gauge each member\u2019s\nopinions and attitudes.\nThe problem with focus groups is that it is vulnerable to group\ndynamics. In every group there is pressure to conform to one\nopinion. Because the discussion is free flowing, in theory at least,\neveryone has an equal voice. Yet if there is a charismatic or\nextremely vocal person forcibly expressing their opinions, in the\ninterest of \u201cmoving on\u201d most people will yield if they perceive the\neffort to be far more than the satisfaction of winning.

The difference here is that\nprojective techniques attempt to disguise the purpose of the research\nby telling the subject the study is studying a different phenomenon.\nIt is also used with children who may have not have the verbal skills\nto do an interview and for topics where people\u2019s thoughts are not\nvery well formed, but the researcher wants to explore their feelings\nand thinking below the surface about a product. The idea is that the\nsubject will then give answers that they do believe rather than what\nresearchers want to hear, which can happen in interviews and focus\ngroup settings. Subjects are asked to participate in such activities as\nwordassociationgames, complete an unfinished sentence, role-play,\nor complete a Rorschach test.

Observational methods are useful because researchers are\npretty confident that their influence is nullified in the outcome of\nthe study. One example is to go to a Man United game in order to\nunderstand what the fans experience. The drawback is that since the\nresearcher remains on the sidelines, they cannot replicate the\noutcome easily.

The idea is that by creating\na model world, many of the extraneous factors are eliminated thus\ngiving the researcher a good idea of the real cause-and-effect rela-\ntionship between variables. Test markets are a great example of this.\nIn a test market setting, a new product is launched in a small sized\ncity with a population that is representative for the whole market.\nResearchers modify each P at a time to determine the best mix.\nAnother new type of testing that is happening in the market place\nis the emergence of scenario testing using simulators. The rapidly\ndeclining cost of computing power along with the emergence of\nprogrammers who realize that technology is meant to make our lives\neasier, the creation of a virtual market using data collected from the\nfield has become more and more prevalent. One of the neat advan-\ntages of using a computer is that it can crunch millions of bits of\ninformation quickly. As we mentioned earlier, to get a good sense of\nhow consumers behave, you need to do lots of studies from a variety\nof perspectives. By using a computer, you can incorporate the find-\nings into one place, and also incorporate market dynamics to simulate\nhow changes in the business environment affect sales. Once you\nbuild the program, you can do virtually anything you please. Want\nto see how your product reacts in an inflationary period with\nhyper-adaptive competitors? With a simulator you can find out.\nThe main reason a marketer would want to use a simulator is for\nplanning purposes. Asking a manager to predict the future is impos-\nsible. However ask a manager what they should do if their\ncompetitor just introduced a new product that seems to catch the\nimagination of the market, you\u2019d get a much better answer. That is\nwhere the simulator comes in. By creating virtual worlds, managers\ncan create contingency plans just in case the proverbial doo doo hits\nthe fan. By having the plans in place, managers will not be caughtMarket Research176", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2427, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e8a0ee4-0e34-4aac-a928-3d2564019cf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e8a0ee4-0e34-4aac-a928-3d2564019cf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9edefa7e-37ce-4ac2-9fd3-07dfea8835aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "4a0e0a2e734cfa6115e50921fbb54e0d741939ca214763f965d57eb12a8f0f05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "334c276a-d2da-4cef-b2df-c96d0f77e35a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "202a4eda4203e6884fd1d1dc91d1715fdcb994a1bfa20081ba7047406935a8ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "013bcb2d-a7be-44f6-a78c-2f2eae6d9299", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf00ee8a8e75982c79736ec0f5d7010f8a8e0712b317ea8163792b0dcaf1fcfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "off guard and forced to react to uncertainty. By anticipating the\nproblem, steps can be taken to mitigate the uncertainty. Simulators\nare starting to get the attention of military planners. Electronic Arts\nmakers of the popular software game called The Sims has a contract\nwith the US military to create virtual worlds. The idea is to see how\nthe chain of command is effected if some calamity struck. Each\nofficer is given a personality, rank and set of orders. By tweaking\nthe scenario rules, planners can assess the effectiveness of their\npolicies under conditions of a nuclear or biological attack. Of course,\nthe key is creating the right model. If the code that models the\ndynamics between people, products and the market does not reflect\nreality, the contingency plans are practically useless.\nOne final note about simulators. A phenomenon that has been\naround for many years but has recently caught the attention of\nmarketers are massivemultiplayeronlinegames(MMOG). These\nare programs which a person can download on their computer and\npay a monthly fee to participate in a virtual world with tens of\nthousands of other players. What makes these games so interesting\nis that while some participants join to engage in escapism (often in\nthe form of hacking monsters to pieces with a battleaxe), some\nsubscribers take up a craft and sell their virtual wares. Every daring\nadventurer needs weapons, clothing, food and a place to sleep and\nnetwork to hear the latest rumours about a king\u2019s ransom guarded\nby a dragon. So some players have decided to cater to those needs\nby creating virtual goods that do just that. And because the service\nis restricted to subscribers, it is easy to attribute a cause to observed\nchanges. For example, hackers of one MMOG managed to exploit a\nflaw which essentially enabled them to mint their own money.\nPredictably the influx of this new money led to an inflation of\nprices. MMOGs are a virtual economy filled with self-aware partici-\npants acting in a normal manner, some are self-interested, others\nselfless. Companies that sell MMOGs may not have realized at the\ntime, but they might have created the ideal testing ground for\nconducting market research.\nAN EMERGING APPROACH \u2013 NEUROMARKETING\nThe field of marketing research marches onward year after year,\nnew techniques, new approaches.

Today, it is much more accepted, though still assigned to\nmore junior market researchers. A type of marketing research\nwhich has recently garnered considerable attention is neuromar-\nketing. What particularly set off this interest was a study published\nin the Oct. 14, 2004 issue of Neuron . Researchers monitored brain-\nscans of 67 people who were given a blind taste test of Coca-Cola\nand Pepsi. Using brain-scanners they could see that each soft drink\n\u201clit up\u201d the brain\u2019s reward system. Participants were evenly split\nabout which drink they preferred. However, when the same people\nwere told what they were drinking, activity in a different set of\nbrain regions were engaged. Three out of four said they preferred\nCoca-Cola. This demonstrated in a fairly dramatic way that brand\nmatters.\nMarketers have long regarded the human mind as a blackbox.\nWe marketers do our thing: beaming advertising, direct marketing\npieces, a sales pitch or what have you to our target market. We can\nmeasure the results of that marketing effort, in terms of sales,\nawareness, liking, etc. We understand reasonably well the beginning\nand end of the process but not the vital part in the middle. That is,\nwhat goes on inside the mind of the consumer. This is what is\nchanging with neuromarketing. First, the basic fundamental science\nunderlying neuromarketing is neuroscience, which is the study of\nthe how the brain gives rise to the mind. In other words how the\nbrain enables us to perceive, think, make decisions, feel emotions,\ncommunicate (i.e., the neural basis of human experience).\nTechniques used by neuroscience are: psychophysics (reaction\ntimes/detection levels), functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(FMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalog-\nraphy (EEG).\nThe most interesting of these to neuromarketing is FMRI scan-\nning. I am sure we all have seen these on ERor other television\nshows, where the patient is slid inside a machine which hums and\nmakes various other noises. Neuromarketing is the application of\nthe techniques of neuroscience to marketing stimuli, in layman\u2019s\nterms, to see how the brain \u201clights up\u201d when exposed to our\nmarketing efforts.

It is being touted by some as the next big thing. If\nmarketers can use science to locate consumers\u2019 \u201cbuy buttons\u201d, then\nwe have gotten closer to opening the blackboxof the consumer\u2019s\nmind. The best use of neuromarketing is in predicting behaviour,\nspotting the advertisements that people remember, selecting the\nmedia format that works best and how what consumers actually do\ndiffers from what they tell focus groups. Other uses I have seen or\nread about include reactions to movie trailers, choices about auto-\nmobiles, the appeal of a pretty face and visceral reactions to political\ncampaign advertising.\nNeuromarketing has critics. We share some of their fears; it raises\nthe possibility of a too useful tool for Big Brother being one of\nthem. Other concerns include the costs and the unpleasantness of a\nscan. Dr. Gemma Calvert, co-founder of Neurosense Ltd., a neuro-\nmarketing consultancy, noted in a recent issue of the London Times :\n\u201cMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is not as expensive as people\nthink and is only slightly more expensive than the average cost of\nconducting focus group s... and OK, it is not pleasant, but it isn\u2019t\nunpleasant either. We have never had a problem getting people into\nscanners; most have read about brain imaging and are really keen to\nhave a go\u201d.\nAt this point brain-scanning is being used as an adjunct to tradi-\ntional market research techniques, including focus groups. In the\nfuture, perhaps 5 to 10 years off at this point, I think brain-scanning\nmay well become a routine part of corporate marketing strategies.\nCONCLUSION\nQualitative methods are favoured by marketers due to their low cost.\nAfter observing a casual relationship between a number of variables,\na quantitative study is launched to test to see if the relationship is\nin fact statistically significant. If significance is determined, then the\nmarketer should adjust the marketing mix to reflect this reality. In\norder to collect data, observational and association techniques are\nused.

Not that we have much of a choice \u2013 foreign\ncompetitors are increasingly the reality. In this chapter we will focus\non the opportunity that competing in foreign markets offers.\nFIRST DECISIONS\nThe starting point for firms seriously considering whether they\nshould market outside their home country is whether they have\nmore attractive opportunities still available in their home market\nbefore they go to the considerable cost of going elsewhere, and it is\nexpensive to market elsewhere. We\u2019ll talk more about those costs\nshortly. So the first question is why go overseas?

Most firms can\nalways grow but the cost of achieving an additional 1% of market\nshare may be prohibitive. Another big reason to compete elsewhere\nis from a view of better understanding your key foreign competi-\ntors so that you can better compete against them in your home\nmarket, which for many firms tend to remain the dominant market\nfor many decades. Some big multinationals firms, like Nokia,\nHitachi and BMW are no longer dominated by their home markets\nand become even more international in their outlook over time. But\nin this case we are thinking about the smaller firm just starting out.\nOther reasons might include, needing a larger customer base to\nachieve economies of scale, wanting to diversify your risk which\ncomes from being too dependent on one market, and customers\ngoing abroad and wanting you to service them there.\nOnce you have decided that you should seriously consider\nforeign markets the next question is which foreign market do you\nstart with? For firms in some countries the choices are fairly\nobvious. For a Canadian firm the US is the natural place to go. For\nMexican firms the US as well. This is due not only to the physical\ncloseness but also economic treaties and what is called psychicor\nculturalproximity. Not only do the US and Canada share borders\nbut they are also culturally quite similar. When most Canadians\ntravel in the US they are assumed to be fellow Americans by\nAmericans. We tend to feel more comfortable in culturally similar\ncountries but more importantly we tend to be more successful\nmarketing to cultures which we naturally seem to understand. In\nEurope it is not quite as obvious where you should first go. Take for\nexample, the Netherlands, the Dutch are quite flexible, because of\ntheir history, culture and language skills. The Dutch tend to be able\nto export to Germans, French, Belgians, Danes and Britons with\nequal ease. Part of this ease is the reality that there is only a little\nover 16 million Dutch people. At a certain point in your success as a\nDutch firm you run out of Dutch people! Then you naturally turn\nto your neighbours for growth. This helps explain why Nokia, the\ncellphone maker, had to naturally start exporting early in their\nhistory, there are fewer Finns, about 5 million.\nThis naturally raises the question, why do we care about growth?\nSome firms where the owner and founder is getting on in years andGLOBAL MARKETING 185", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2523, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8acf3d98-3027-4b69-8ca9-ba2aaf381f09": {"__data__": {"id_": "8acf3d98-3027-4b69-8ca9-ba2aaf381f09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec3084c9-6954-4968-9748-f41286d7dea6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "6ff5dfdb3099a8d2114697de1127be55fcff332f72f2a554da7e58a1a5b6176e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f2109a5-a06c-4f8f-94aa-ee467d39137c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "c21b9a6a0303101de3f4fe135f7bb99340c71b1ad4fdb4d11fc6faf2e970c1ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49e56539-1f3b-4e64-a640-844132087116", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "faaf19e1ef95dc259f9b1fa818e09583e674ba284509c046a16182fbb638b9e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "may not care, they are just waiting it out till retirement and\nenjoying the income which flows from years of hard work.\nHowever for publicly traded companies or for firms with younger\nowners growth is a necessity.

That is should it indirectly export, directly\nexport, license its product to another firm, form a joint venture or\nuse direct investment. This is a critical decision which we will spend\nsome time on next. Over time as the firms enjoys or doesn\u2019t enjoy\nsuccess it may well evolve in an intelligent design from one form to\na more committed form.

Occasionalexporting\nis a relatively passive phase which we talked about earlier where the\nfirm exports from time to time almost under protest. Active\nexportingtakes place when the firm makes a commitment to expand\ninto a particular market or markets.

One of the key ways many firms have traditionally\ngotten started overseas is through overseas trade shows.

The shows bring thousands of potential buyers\nand sellers together for the very purpose of connected manufac-\nturers and firms that can help them export to their market.

The biggest\nplace for online orders is flagship website sharperimage.com which\nmainly serves the home market of the US. It also operates 10 other\nsites for markets worldwide. Included among the 10 is a Spanish-\nlanguage version of its US site that\u2019s used by consumers in Mexico\nand Latin America as well as by Spanish-speaking people in the US.\nThe other sites are designed for the UK, Germany, Australia, Hong\nKong, China, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, with a separate site for\nthe European Union.

The licensor issues a license to a foreign company\nto use a manufacturing process, trademark, patent, trade secret, or\nsome other item of value for a fee or royalty payment. The licensee\ngains product expertise, a well-known product or brand, or some\nother knowledge or right it would be expensive to obtain, while the\nlicensor gains entry into a new market with little risk. There are, like\nanything in life, strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are very\nreal and must be taken account of. The licensor has less control over\nthe licensee than it does over its own employees. And if the licensee\nis quite successful the firm has given up considerable profit and may\nhave created its own competition when the contract ends. One way\nto avoid this is do what Coke does and provide a key proprietary\ningredient or part vital to the product. However, the best strategy is\nfor the licensor to be an innovation leader keeping ahead of the pack\nthus having the licensee to continue to be dependent on the licensor.\nThere are several variations on this theme.

This is where your firm owns manufacturing or assembly\nfacilities in another country. The foreign company can have part or\nfull interest in a local company or build its own facilities. Auto\ngiant GM has invested billions of dollars over decades in auto\nmanufacturers around the world, including China\u2019s Shangai GM\nand Jinbei GM; Italy\u2019s Fiat; Japan\u2019s Isuzu and Suzuki; Korea\u2019s\nKaewoo, Suzuki; Sweden\u2019s Saab, and AvtoVAZ of Russia. If the\nmarket is large enough warrant this type of entry, foreign\nproduc tion facilities offer some real advantages. Firstly, the firm\nenjoys cost savings in terms of cheaper labour or raw materials,\nforeign government investment incentives if they exist and they\noften do, and transportation savings since you are much closer to\nthe customer.\nThere are further advantages of FDI; for example, the firm tends\nto enjoy a better image in the host country with government and\ncustomers alike. Wal-Mart and MacDonald\u2019s both well-known US\nfirms try to do this abroad. Wal-Mart bought ASDA in the UK,\nSeiyu in Japan, and Woolco in Canada in order to create a local\npresence quickly. In the UK and Japan they continued to trade\nunder the names of the firms they bought. In Canada they have\nsought to Canadianize Wal-Mart as much as possible so it begins to\nseem like another Canadian firm to Canadian customers. Another\nadvantage is that the firm can build a deeper relationship with\ncustomers, local suppliers and the distribution system of the\ncountry. This is quite helpful in adapting their products to the\nparticular needs of that country. Also, the company retains control\nover its investment and can implement global standards in manu-\nfacturing and marketing policies. Finally the firm is assured of\nmarket access in that country in case the host country government\nstarts insisting on locally produced content.

If it adapts both the\nproduct and the communications, the firm is doing dualadaptation\n(see Figure 9.2).\nThe starting point is the message that you are trying to commu-\nnicate. The firm can use one message globally, varying only the\nlanguage, name and colours. Exxon has used \u201cPut a tiger in your\ntank\u201d with just small variations everywhere; this is an idea that\nseems to resonate in every culture. Colours may need to be changed\nbecause of cultural taboos. Purple for example, is the colour for death\nin parts of South America. Whereas it is white in India and East\nAsian countries and black in the West. The second possibility is to\nuse the same theme around the world but adapt the copy to each local\nmarket.

In Venezuela, a man was seen in the\nbathroom with a wedding ring prominently displayed on his hand;\nin Italy and France, only a man\u2019s hand was seen; and in Japan, the man\nwaited outside.

In some parts of the world,\nmisogynist-type messages are still permissible, in others they are not.\nGroupe Bull, a French IT company, used to own a subsidiary in the\nUS that sold high-speed printers.

A Dior scarf may\nsell for $200 in France but $300 in Tokyo. Is this the customer being\nripped off? Most likely not. Dior has to add the cost of transportation,\ntariffs, importer margins, wholesaler margins and retailer margins to\nthe factory price. Plus it is simply expensive to do business in Tokyo\nwhere rents are high and so are wages. Depending on these added\ncosts and currency fluctuations the product may sell for two to three\ntimes or more what it costs in the country of manufacturer in order to\nend up with the same level of profit for the manufacturer. In some\ncases some products in supermarkets are cheaper in the inner city\nthan in a wealthy suburb because they will simply not sell at the\nhigher price point. The price charged by your key competitors\nprovides a very real test to see if you can charge more.\nAnother issue is transferpricing, that is the price that a\ncompany charges to its\u2019 own subsidiaries in foreign countries. If it\ncharges too high a price it may end up paying higher tariff duties\nalthough it may than pay lower income taxes in the foreign country.\nIf the company charges too little it can be charged with dumping.\nDumping is when a company charges either less than it costs or less\nthan it charges in its home market, in order to buy their way into a\nmarket or capture high market share. When a country\u2019s customs\nauthority finds evidence of dumping it can typically levy a dumping\ntariff against the firm.\nMany multinationals have to wrestle with the problem of grey\nmarkets, no, this is not marketing to older people. It is where\nbranded products are diverted from normal or authorized distribu-\ntions channels in one country and sold in another. This happens\nwhen there is a substantial price difference between the two coun-\ntries. In North America quite a large business has sprung up with\nAmericans, particularly elder ones who have a number of prescrip-\ntions, coming by bus to Canada to buy their drugs at very large\ndiscounts.

Grey markets,\nunlike black markets, are not illegal but are quite irritating to the\nfirms involved because they lose considerable amounts of profit and\nlose a degree of control of channels of distribution. Multinationals\ntry to prevent grey markets in several ways. Firstly, by policing\ntheir distributors, looking for usually high sales, sales figures that\ndon\u2019t make sense given their home markets. Another technique is\nto alter product characteristics or service warranties for different\ncountries. For example you buy a HP printer in Hong Kong at a\ngreat price only to find that it\u2019s service warranty is only valid in\nthat country. The problem with this approach is that the customer\nfeels ripped off, they bought a perfectly good HP product but can\u2019t\nuse the warranty, they should be upset with the store in Hong Kong\nthat sold it to them with mentioning the geographically limited\nwarranty coverage but they will mainly be mad at HP. Many firms\ntry to shut down grey markets. But given the customer unhappi-\nness it creates and the amount of effort required, vendors are\nlearning to accept people do use and pay for their products.\nDISTRIBUTION CHANNELS\nThere is a surprising degree of variation in the ways products get to\nmarket in various countries. Selling soap in Japan involves one of\nthe most complex distribution systems in the world. You must sell\nto a general wholesaler, who sells to a regional wholesaler, who sells\nto local wholesaler, who finally sells to retailers. With the product\npassing through all these channel members, the price paid by\nconsumer\u2019s ends up doubling or tripling what the importer origi-\nnally paid. Beyond the length of the channels, the retail end of the\nsystem can be quite different as well. Large-scale retailers like Wal-\nMart and Sears dominate in the US but in many other countries the\nretailing sector is more run by small, independent retailers. In\nIndia, millions of little shops or just a spot in an open air market are\nkey to moving products. Prices appear high but haggling is the\norder of the day. Indian incomes are low and many must shop daily\nfor small amounts, cigarettes are often bought singly.\nWhen a firm first enters a country it generally first works with\nlocal distributors but as it learns the system it may increasinglyGLOBAL MARKETING200", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2424, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04e25fd5-23f7-4959-89fa-9488afe67e76": {"__data__": {"id_": "04e25fd5-23f7-4959-89fa-9488afe67e76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "076e7573-48df-45ea-9d9a-fd97efc2c658", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "b444ea86030edfc34491444ba8e777dbe75b706f5eddec68e79e78daeb3537a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8acc9948-9fac-4813-b20e-7a9ac5fe0727", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "200", "file_name": "data/Chap31.pdf"}, "hash": "109ddbd3eaa3f3689368652811acf9eb86f43e5c202db50abe1a668e34b886e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e51eed6-a48d-4718-8606-ac290ee83a6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b44c0c87eceeafd937d4a2d3fe259fd3b0b90506751f1ec5185110d9775d2d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "venture out on its\u2019 own.
