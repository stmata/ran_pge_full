Companies must also communicate with current and potential stakehold -\ners and the general public to inform them about the attributes of their offerings. For most marketers, \ntherefore, the question is not whether  to communicate but rather what  to say, how  and when  to say it, \nto whom , and how often . Consumers can turn to hundreds of cable and satellite TV channels, thou -\nsands of magazines and newspapers, and millions of internet pages and are actively deciding what \ncommunications they want to receive. To achieve their strategic goals, holistic marketers must craft \ncommunication campaigns that can break through the clutter and reach customers on a personal \nlevel. Consider Unilever\u2019s experience in positioning its Dove brand and developing the \u201cCampaign \nfor Real Beauty.\u201dManaging Marketing \nCommunications12\nDove\u2019s highly praised \nCampaign for Real \nBeauty, encouraging \nwomen to appreciate \ntheir individual beauty, \nresonated with \nconsumers and boosted \ncompany sales by more \nthan 60 percent. \nSource: Retro AdArchives/Alamy \nStock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2128c31b-ecdb-48be-823f-fbf1fd0d3b8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2128c31b-ecdb-48be-823f-fbf1fd0d3b8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db20a1b8-8edd-4e29-a4a8-4f6c3549e287", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "a2354bafd3a1999ea84d9767ffc7cad6192f9584d33fec2a81966804c1beeb58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e03bd533-4d35-429e-a0ee-27ecb4f8e1bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "c763942207a21650e8138d5905942ce213d870696eaeb60d0484642a9689a8b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "143f3ecf-a210-4421-943f-cb87789200d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cfed1823a20bcf086a18fb5d31dde43f69bbd91ff79721bf53265f42a687c27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "263PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\n12.1  Explain the role of marketing communications.\n12.2  Define meaningful communication objectives.\n12.3  Describe how a company should identify target \ncustomers and craft the communication message.\n12.4  Explain how a company should decide on \nthe communication media mix and develop a \nmedia\u00a0plan.12.5  Describe the creative strategies involved \nin developing an effective communication \ncampaign.\n12.6  Identify actionable metrics for measuring \ncommunication effectiveness.\n>>> Dove  Dove\u2019s \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty\u201d is often cited as belonging on the list of best \ncommercials of all times for its bold, authentic, and impactful approach that combines the \ngoals of selling beauty products and changing societal notions of beauty. Rather than feed -\ning on  women\u2019s insecurities and encouraging them to strive to be more attractive, Dove took \nthe opposite approach, encouraging women to look beyond the skin-deep beauty offered by \nmost cosmetic products to the attributes that have already made them beautiful. The impe -\ntus for the campaign was a global survey in 2004 that found that less than a quarter of the \nwomen surveyed felt they were responsible for setting their own standards of beauty and that \nonly 2\u00a0  percent considered themselves beautiful. The campaign, developed by Ogilvy & Mather, \ndebuted in 2003 in the U.K. and involved billboards showing a range of \u201ctypical\u201d women, rather \nthan models, in their underwear. In Toronto, Canada, a similar billboard featured a curvy woman \nwith taglines \u201cfat or fit?\u201d and \u201cgrey or gorgeous?\u201d asking drivers to text in their votes.  However, \nit was the 2006 \u201cEvolution\u201d viral video mocking the practice of photoshopping women\u2019s pic -\ntures to create a \u201csocially desirable\u201d image of women\u2019s beauty that brought the campaign into \nprominence. Dove\u2019s message resonated with consumers and the media, and the relatively \nsmall-budget film funded by Unilever Canada became one of the very first viral branded videos. \nThe Campaign for Real Beauty benefited from the fact that it was perceived to be authentic in \nrepresenting the Dove brand. Indeed, the company had always used \u201creal\u201d women in its ads in \nan attempt to empower women to redefine beauty on their own terms. It was not just about sell -\ning soap; it was a campaign that aimed to redefine the perception of beauty. The success of the \ncampaign was not limited to its media popularity: Dove\u2019s sales increased from $2.5 billion to \nover $4\u00a0billion during the campaign. Over the years, Dove has stayed loyal to the core premise \nof the campaign.

In a sense, it represents \nthe voice of the company and its brands; it is a means by which the firm can establish a dialog and \nbuild relationships with consumers. By strengthening customer loyalty, marketing communication \ncan contribute to customer equity.\nMarketing communication also works by showing consumers how and why a product is used, by \nwhom, where, and when. Consumers can learn who makes the product and what the company and \nbrand stand for, and they can become motivated to try or use it. Marketing communication allows \ncompanies to link their brands to other people, places, events, brands, experiences, feelings, and things. \nIt can contribute to brand equity by establishing the brand in memory and creating a brand image, as \nwell as by driving sales and affecting shareholder value.\nTHE COMMUNICATION PROCESS\nMarketers should understand the fundamental elements of effective communication. The communi -\ncation process can be viewed from two perspectives: a more general macro perspective delineating \nthe key aspects of communication as an interactive process, and a more specific micro perspective \nfocusing on the way the message recipient responds to the communication. These two perspectives \nare reflected in the two models of communication: a macromodel and a micromodel.\nMacromodel of the Communication Process.  The macromodel of marketing \n communication  articulates the interaction between the sender (company) and the recipient (con -\nsumer) of the communication message. Figure 12.1 shows a macromodel denoting nine key factors \nin effective communication. Two represent the major parties\u2014 sender  and receiver . Two represent the \nmajor tools\u2014 message  and media . Four represent major communication functions\u2014 encoding, decoding, \nresponse , and feedback . And the last element in the system is noise , random and competing messages that \nmay interfere with the intended communication.\nSenders must know what audiences they want to reach and what responses they want to evoke. \nThey must encode their messages so the target audience can successfully decode them. In other \nwords, the sender must express the message in a particular tangible form\u2014words, images, sounds, \nor  movements\u2014so that the intended message can later be retrieved by the recipient. Senders must \ntransmit the message through media that reach the target audience and develop feedback channels \nto monitor the responses. The more the sender\u2019s field of experience overlaps with the receiver\u2019s, the \nmore effective the message is likely to be. Note that selective attention, distortion, and retention pro -\ncesses\u00a0(discussed in Chapter 4) may affect how recipients receive and interpret the message.\nMicromodel of Marketing Communication.  A micromodel of marketing communi -\ncation  concentrates on consumers\u2019 specific responses to communications.2 Classic response hierarchy \nmodels assume that the buyer passes through cognitive, affective, and behavioral stages, in that order.3 \nThis \u201clearn\u2013feel\u2013do\u201d sequence is more appropriate when the audience has high involvement with a \nproduct category perceived to have meaningful differentiation, such as an automobile or a house. An \nalternative sequence, \u201cdo\u2013feel\u2013learn,\u201d is relevant when the audience has high involvement but perceives \nlittle or no differentiation within the product category, as is the case with airline tickets or personal \nFIGURE 12.1 \nElements  \nin the Communication \nProcess\nSENDER Encoding Decoding\nResponse FeedbackNoiseRECEIVER\n Message\nMedia", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3766, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f3fe99a-5cc1-48d2-95be-c8b69b01a0d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f3fe99a-5cc1-48d2-95be-c8b69b01a0d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73dac526-8018-444d-abe2-e058ca3e376d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "30396b7a58f15204ed612481c738e3ac3d58bf2480c2252345d39a3fd5e12bd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "143f3ecf-a210-4421-943f-cb87789200d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "f063e4c4ad61ab57639961221cac176c58e326da7638bcd43e79bee6468c6939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14d2fb2e-c117-41d7-9724-0a4054857d25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32ddb84aa833623a85bb13d75ad94b2790818dc560b13a4c7fb8ed6589d1d23a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 12    |  MANAGING  MARkETING  COMMUNICATIONS  265\ncomputers. A third sequence, \u201clearn\u2013do\u2013feel,\u201d is relevant when the audience has low involvement \nand perceives little differentiation, such as with salt or batteries. By choosing the right sequence, the \nmarketer can do a better job of planning communications.\nRegardless of their specific sequence, several steps are involved in generating a consumer response.\n\u2022 Awareness.  In order to take any kind of action, customers must be aware of the existence of the \ncompany\u2019s offering. If most of the target audience is unaware of the offering, the communicator\u2019s \ntask is to build awareness.\n\u2022 Knowledge.  The target audience might have awareness but not know much more about the offering.\n\u2022 Liking.  Members of the target audience may know the brand, but how do they feel about it?\n\u2022 Preference.  The target audience might like the product but not prefer it to other products. The com -\nmunicator must then try to build consumer preference by comparing the product\u2019s quality, value, \nperformance, and other features to those of likely competitors.\n\u2022 Conviction.  The target audience might prefer a particular product but not develop a conviction \nabout buying it.\n\u2022 Purchase.  Finally, some members of the target audience might have conviction but not quite get \naround to making the purchase. The communicator must lead these consumers to take the final \nstep, perhaps by offering the product at a low price, offering a premium, or letting them try it out.\nTo increase the odds of success for a communication campaign, marketers must attempt to \nincrease the likelihood that each  step occurs. Thus, the communication campaign must ensure (1) that \nthe right consumer is exposed to the right message at the right place and at the right time, (2) that the \noffering is correctly positioned in terms of desirable and deliverable points of difference and points of \nparity, (3) that the consumer pays attention to the campaign and adequately comprehends the intended \nmessage, and (4) that consumers are motivated to consider purchasing and using the offering.\nDEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION PROGRAM\nTo develop an effective communication program, a company must follow a systematic process \nthat starts with setting the goals to be achieved by the communication campaign and concludes \nwith assessing the outcome of the campaign. The key steps in developing effective communica -\ntions are shown in Figure 12.2. These include setting the communication objectives, identifying \nthe target audience, crafting the communication message, selecting the communication channels, \ndeveloping the creative aspect of communication, and measuring communication effectiveness.\nThe ultimate success of a company\u2019s communication campaign depends on the viability of \nthe overall strategy and tactics for managing the company\u2019s offering, which serve as a basis for \ndeveloping a communication plan. Thus communication objectives, the choice of target audience, \nand the design of the communication message typically follow from the company\u2019s overarching \nmarketing plan that defines the offering\u2019s goals, its target customers, and its value proposition.\nSetting the Communication Objectives\nSetting the objectives of a communication campaign involves three key decisions: defining the  \nfocus of company communications, setting communication benchmarks, and determining \nthe\u00a0communication budget. We discuss these decisions in more detail in the following sections.\nDEFINING THE FOCUS OF COMPANY \nCOMMUNICATIONS\nA communication objective  is a specific task and achievement level to be accomplished with a \nspecific audience in a specific period of time.4 We classify communication objectives according \nto whether they aim to create awareness by informing the target audience about the offering, to \nbuild preferences by persuading the audience of the benefits of the offering, or to incite action \nby nudging the audience to act in a way that benefits the company and its offering.\n\u2022 Creating awareness  provides a foundation for brand equity. Creating awareness involves \nfostering the consumer\u2019s ability to recognize or recall the brand in sufficient detail to make \na purchase. Recognition is easier to achieve than recall\u2014consumers who are asked to think FIGURE 12.2 \nDeveloping a \nCommunication Program\nMeasuring performanceDeveloping the creative approachDeciding on the mediaCrafting the messageSetting the objectives\nIdentifying the audience", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4498, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14d2fb2e-c117-41d7-9724-0a4054857d25": {"__data__": {"id_": "14d2fb2e-c117-41d7-9724-0a4054857d25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d1fe6fc-8836-447a-9c07-5154a87cbf7b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "ba7819d38e564a7cdab803a818ecb5b4cc29f9709d64da2ab0246f999c53f34b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f3fe99a-5cc1-48d2-95be-c8b69b01a0d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "a668170c431358c9a7eccb4446569df5791643d7e46343b7fee1d66ae1d3c597", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de06fd31-0547-478c-a7ec-18d75ac0b21a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc09506edf6ade5b98f6f84e246613640025711e4b208409c8434f1463dd0934", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "266 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nof a brand of frozen entr\u00e9es are more likely to recognize Stouffer\u2019s distinctive orange packages \nthan to recall the brand without seeing it. Brand recall  tends to be important for consumers who \nhave received marketing communications outside the store when the company\u2019s offerings are not \nreadily visible and available for purchase. In contrast, brand recognition  tends to be important inside \nthe store when consumers can readily see and purchase the company\u2019s offering. Creating aware -\nness can involve highlighting awareness of the need (stimulating primary demand) or awareness \nof the specific offering (stimulating selective demand).\n\u2022 Building preferences  involves communicating an offering\u2019s ability to meet a currently rele -\nvant consumer need. Some relevant needs are negatively oriented (problem removal, problem \navoidance, incomplete satisfaction, normal depletion). For example, many household clean -\ning  products communicate their ability to solve problems. Other needs are positively oriented \n(sensory gratification, intellectual stimulation, or social approval). For example, food products \noften use sensory-oriented ads emphasizing appetite appeal. Persuasive communication aims \nto create liking and preference for a product or service and conviction of its benefits. Some \npersuasive communication is comparative in nature: It explicitly compares the attributes of two \nor more brands, such as the Chrysler TV ad for the Dodge Ram that asked, \u201cWhat if you were \nto take away horsepower, torque and warranty coverage from a Ram? Well, you\u2019d end up with \na Ford F-150.\u201d5 Comparative communication works best when it elicits cognitive and affective \n motivations simultaneously and when consumers process the advertising in a detailed, analyti -\ncal mode.6 In contrast, reinforcement communication aims to convince current purchasers that \nthey made the right choice. Automobile ads often depict satisfied customers enjoying special \nfeatures of their new car.\n\u2022 Inciting action  involves motivating consumers to decide to purchase the brand or take purchase-\nrelated action. Promotional offers like coupons or two-for-one deals encourage consumers to \nmake a mental commitment to buy. But many consumers do not have an expressed category \nneed and may not be in the market when exposed to an ad, so they are unlikely to form purchase \nintentions. In any given week, only about 20 percent of adults may be planning to buy detergent, \nonly 2 percent to buy a carpet cleaner, and only 0.25 percent to buy a car. Action-focused com -\nmunication aims to stimulate purchase of products and services.\nThe communication objective should emerge from a thorough analysis of the current marketing \nsituation.7 If the product class is mature, the company is the market leader, and brand usage is low, \nthe objective might be to stimulate more frequent usage. If the product class is new, the company is \nnot the market leader, and the brand is superior to the leader, the objective might be to convince the \nmarket of the brand\u2019s superiority.\nCommunication objectives for the company\u2019s offering also depend on the current consumer state \nof awareness. Consider the two offerings depicted in Figure 12.3. We find that 80 percent of the consum -\ners in the total market are aware of Brand A, 60 percent have tried it, and only 20 percent who tried it \nare satisfied. This indicates that the communication program is effective in creating awareness, but the \nproduct fails to meet consumer expectations. Hence, in this case the company might benefit from focus -\ning on improving the product. In contrast, 40 percent of the consumers in the total market are aware \nof Brand B and only 30 percent have tried it, but 80 percent of them are satisfied. In this case, the com -\nmunication program might benefit from focusing on creating awareness and encouraging brand trial.\nFIGURE 12.3 \nCurrent Consumer \nStates for Two \nOfferings\n80%\nsatis\ufb01ed\n20%\ndisappointed80%\ndisappointed20%\nsatis\ufb01ed\nSatisfaction Satisfaction30% tried70% did\nnot try60%\ntried\nBrand\nTrialBrand\nTrial40%\ndid not\ntry\nTotal Awareness Total Awareness40%\nawareBrand A Brand B\n80%\naware100%\nmarket20%\nnot aware\n60% not\naware\n100%\nmarket", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4249, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de06fd31-0547-478c-a7ec-18d75ac0b21a": {"__data__": {"id_": "de06fd31-0547-478c-a7ec-18d75ac0b21a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24a0ecf1-3659-45ee-ba4c-ee20527fd447", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "e550ad2b2e573ca1d3d949841c2f735ec2beeb3d7f5a57f66ad737e8aa7592db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14d2fb2e-c117-41d7-9724-0a4054857d25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "ba7819d38e564a7cdab803a818ecb5b4cc29f9709d64da2ab0246f999c53f34b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f020985-98ef-441c-9486-900893c82f41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d35928c9551522d8ff493ba2bb7647cb51cf8736dc82431bf022859a9496527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 12    |  MANAGING  MARkETING  COMMUNICATIONS  267\nSETTING THE COMMUNICATION BENCHMARKS\nIn addition to defining the focus of the communication campaign, a company must set clear bench -\nmarks that define the magnitude of the desired impact and the time frame within which a particu -\nlar outcome\u2014awareness, preference, or action\u2014must be achieved. Without such well-articulated \nbenchmarks, a company will find it challenging to design an effective communication campaign that \nis aligned with its strategic goals.\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of communication benchmarks: quantitative and temporal. \nQuantitative benchmarks quantify a particular objective. For example, quantitative benchmarks might \ndetermine the level of awareness that the communication campaign must achieve, the desired strength of \npreferences among the target audience, and the specifics of the action that the communication campaign \nmust create. Temporal benchmarks, on the other hand, define the timeframe within which a particular \noutcome has to be achieved. Quantitative and temporal benchmarks are closely related and interdepen -\ndent: Setting a particular timeframe is contingent on the magnitude of the desired outcome, and vice versa.\nTo be actionable, a communication objective must have a clearly articulated focus as well as clearly \ndefined quantitative and temporal benchmarks. To illustrate, consider the following communication \nobjectives:\nCreate awareness of the new James Bond movie (focus) among 40 percent of Millennial \n consumers (quantitative benchmark) prior to the movie premiere (temporal benchmark).\nIncrease the number of consumers who believe that toothpaste Brand X has superior \n whitening power (focus) from 10 percent to 40 percent (quantitative benchmark) in one year \n(temporal benchmark).\nDefining quantitative and temporal benchmarks is important, because without knowing what \nparticular outcome needs to be achieved and the timeframe for achieving it, a company will find it \ndifficult to design an effective communication program. In addition to guiding the development of a \ncommunication campaign, quantitative and temporal benchmarks are important for determining the \neffectiveness of the company\u2019s communication activities. In this context, performance benchmarks act \nas reference points against which the accomplishments of the communication campaign are assessed.\nDETERMINING THE COMMUNICATION BUDGET\nOne of the most difficult marketing decisions is choosing how much to spend on marketing commu -\nnications. How does a company know it\u2019s spending the right amount? John Wanamaker, the depart -\nment store magnate, once said, \u201cI know that half of my advertising is wasted, but I don\u2019t know which \nhalf.\u201d Industries and companies vary considerably in how much they spend on marketing commu -\nnications. Expenditures might be 50 percent of sales in the cosmetics industry, but only 5 percent in \nthe industrial equipment industry. Even within a given industry, there are low- and high-spending \ncompanies.\nA practical approach for defining the communication budget is objective-and-task budgeting . \nThis approach calls for marketers to develop a communication budget by defining specific objectives, \nidentifying the tasks that must be performed to achieve these objectives, and estimating their costs. \nThe sum of these costs is the proposed communication budget. The overarching principle is that the \ntotal communication budget must be set so the marginal profit from every communication dollar \nis greater than or equal to the marginal profit from every dollar spent on other marketing activities.\nHow much resources should a company allocate to marketing communications compared to \nalternatives such as product improvement, lower prices, or better service? There is no universal rule. \nHow much to spend on marketing communications depends on a variety of factors. The main factors \nto consider when setting the communication budget follow.8\n\u2022 Stage in the product life cycle.  New products typically merit large communication budgets to build \nawareness and encourage consumer trial. Established brands usually are supported by relatively \nlower communication budgets, measured as percentage of sales.\n\u2022 Product differentiation.  Offerings in less differentiated categories (beer, soft drinks, banks, and air -\nlines) often require more advertising to establish a unique image than do offerings that provide \ndistinct benefits.\n\u2022 Market share.  High-market-share brands usually require less advertising expenditure, measured as \na percentage of sales, to maintain share.

The number of repetitions needed to get the company\u2019s message across to con -\nsumers has a direct impact on the communication budget. More complex messages tend to require \nmore repetition and, hence, a larger communication budget.\n\u2022 Reach.  A company\u2019s ability to reach consumers in an effective and cost-efficient manner. \n Communications to customers who are more difficult to reach tend to require a larger commu -\nnication budget.\n\u2022 Competitive communication.  In markets with a large number of competitors and high communication \nspending, a brand must advertise more heavily to be heard. Even communications not directly \ncompetitive to the brand create clutter and a need for heavier advertising.\n\u2022 Available resources.  The communication budget is limited by the company\u2019s resources. After all, a \ncompany cannot spend something it does not have.\nTo set a meaningful communication budget, a company must take into account all of these  \nfactors. Yet some companies fail to consider all factors and instead single out one particular metric: \nsetting their communication budgets at parity with competitors. This approach, also referred to as \ncompetitive-parity budgeting , is problematic because there are no grounds for believing competi -\ntors are more knowledgeable about what the optimal communication budget should be. Company \nreputations, resources, opportunities, and objectives differ so greatly that communication budgets are \nhardly a guide for others. And there is no evidence that budgets based on competitive parity discourage \ncommunication wars.\nAnother group of companies set the communication budget at what they think they can afford. \nThis approach completely ignores the role of marketing communication as an investment and its \nimmediate impact on sales volume. It also leads to an uncertain annual budget, which makes long-\nrange planning difficult, and it yields a budget set by the availability of funds rather than by market \nopportunities. Available resources certainly play an important role in determining the overall com -\nmunication budget, but basing the communication budget exclusively on the available resources is \nlikely to lead to overspending (for large companies) or underspending (for smaller firms).\nFinally, some companies set communication expenditures at a specified percentage of current or \nanticipated sales revenues. Automobile companies often allocate to marketing communication a fixed \npercentage based on the planned car price. Oil companies appropriate a fraction of a cent for each gal -\nlon of gasoline sold under their own labels. Though practical in terms of implementation, when such \nan approach is used in isolation from the communication task to be achieved, it can lead to impracti -\ncal allocation of a company\u2019s resources, ultimately yielding an ineffective communication campaign.\nAlthough marketing communication is treated as a current expense, part of it can be considered \nan investment in building brand equity and customer loyalty. When a company spends $5 million on \ncapital equipment, it can call the equipment a five-year depreciable asset and write off only one-fifth of \nthe cost in the first year. When it spends $5 million on advertising to launch a new product, however, \nit must write off the entire cost in the first year, reducing its reported profit, even if the advertising \nbenefits will persist for many years to come.\nIdentifying the Target Audience \nand\u00a0Crafting the Communication Message\nIdentifying the target audience and developing the communication message are the two key com -\nponents that define the strategy of a company\u2019s communication campaign. These two decisions, in \nturn, define the tactical aspects of the communication campaign, including selecting the right media \nand developing an effective creative solution.\nIDENTIFYING THE TARGET AUDIENCE\nThe process must start with a clear target audience in mind: potential buyers of the company\u2019s prod -\nucts, current users, deciders, and influencers, as well as individuals, groups, particular sectors, or the \ngeneral public. The target audience critically affects the communicator\u2019s decisions about what to say \nand about how, when, where, and to whom to say it.\nIt is possible to profile the target audience in terms of any of the identified market segments, but \nit\u2019s often useful to do so in terms of usage and loyalty. Is the target new to the category or a current \nuser? Is the target loyal to the brand, loyal to a competitor, or someone who switches between brands?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4594, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94a3ee6c-920f-4f20-a09d-2363540f628e": {"__data__": {"id_": "94a3ee6c-920f-4f20-a09d-2363540f628e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "253b53e7-b12f-42e4-a067-bb9faa09044f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "6b5a3a7fa03824742d4d263220a8e9de6cbfae6c796488b75d04d7baa0786a42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f020985-98ef-441c-9486-900893c82f41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "cdbb3635a56353b81f498baa4ef2dc5d89ade74fa6d91125af9d4e12f3d4fc8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54d2d4d2-6533-4008-8c64-af34e5d85173", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15089814f29fc4fcfb69573e2ac956fd20771c2fb0f4d834350bbcecdc72f5dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 12    |  MANAGING  MARkETING  COMMUNICATIONS  269\nIf a brand user, is he or she a heavy or a light user? Communication strategy will differ depending on \nthe answers.\nThe choice of target audience for the communication campaign is directly related to the choice \nof the target market for the company\u2019s offering. Indeed, the ultimate goal of the communication cam -\npaign is to facilitate awareness, preference, purchase, and usage of the company\u2019s offering. Yet the \ntarget  market and the target audience do not always fully overlap. And on some occasions, the target \naudience can differ from the target market.\nFor example, a cereal manufacturer might develop a communication campaign to promote its \nproducts to kids even though the actual purchase is often made by adults. In the same vein, a milk \nproducer might choose to promote its products to adults even though most of the consumption is \nlikely to be done by kids.\nThe target audience for a company\u2019s communication campaign is likely to diverge from the com -\npany\u2019s target customers when purchase and usage decisions are made by a group rather than by a \nsingle individual. In this case, the communication campaign might target different members of the \ndecision-making unit who are likely to exert influence over the end user\u2019s actions.\nCRAFTING THE COMMUNICATION MESSAGE\nMarketers are always seeking the \u201cbig idea\u201d that resonates with consumers rationally and emotion -\nally, distinguishes the brand from competitors, and is broad and flexible enough to translate into \ndifferent media, markets, and time periods. Fresh insights are important for creating unique appeals \nand position.\nA good ad normally focuses on one or two core selling propositions. As part of refining the \nbrand positioning, the advertiser should conduct market research to determine which appeal works \nbest with its target audience and then prepare a creative brief , typically one or two pages. This \nelaboration of the positioning strategy includes considerations such as key message, target audience, \ncommunication objectives (to do, to know, to believe), key brand benefits, support for the brand \npromise, and media.\nHow many communication messages should the advertiser create before choosing one? The more \nmessages explored, the higher the probability of finding an excellent one. To this end, a company might \nrely on its own marketing team, engage an external advertising agency, or rely on crowdsourcing by \nrecruiting consumers to come up with an effective communication message.9\nAlthough entrusting consumers with a brand\u2019s marketing effort can be pure genius, it can also \nbe a regrettable failure. When Kraft sought a hip name for a new flavor of its iconic Vegemite product \nin Australia, it labeled the first 3 million jars \u201cName Me\u201d to enlist consumer support. But when, from \namong 48,000 entries, Kraft selected the name \u201ciSnack 2.0,\u201d sales plummeted. The company had to pull \niSnack jars from the shelves and start from scratch in a more conventional fashion, finally choosing \nthe new name Cheesybite.10\nIn selecting a message strategy, management searches for appeals, themes, or ideas that will tie \nin to the brand positioning and help establish points of parity or points of difference. Some of these \nappeals or ideas may relate directly to product or service performance (the quality, economy, or value \nof the brand); others may relate to more extrinsic considerations (the brand as being contemporary, \npopular, or traditional).\nDeciding on the Communication Media\nCompanies must allocate their marketing communication budget over the nine major modes of \n communication\u2014advertising, online and social media, mobile communication, direct market -\ning, events and experiences, word of mouth, publicity and public relations, personal selling, and \n packaging. Within the same industry, companies can differ considerably in their media and channel \nchoices. Avon concentrates its promotional funds on personal selling, whereas Revlon spends heav -\nily on advertising. Electrolux spent heavily on a door-to-door sales force for years, whereas Hoover \nrelied more on advertising.\nCompanies are always searching for ways to gain efficiency by substituting one communica -\ntion tool for others. Many are replacing some field sales activity with ads, direct mail, and telemar -\nketing.

Customers come to know a brand through a range of touch \npoints, including online clubs and consumer communities, trade shows, event marketing, sponsorship, \nfactory visits, public relations and press releases, and social cause marketing. To effectively communicate \nits value proposition to its target audience, a company should develop an integrated marketing com -\nmunication campaign that spans different media. Consider how BMW has built the MINI Cooper brand \nin the United States by attracting attention through its creative use of diverse media formats.\nMINI Cooper  When BMW launched the modernized MINI Cooper in the United States, it \nemployed a broad mix of media: billboards, posters, the internet, print, PR, product placement, \nand grassroots activities. Many media were linked to a cleverly designed website with product \nand dealer information. The imaginative, integrated campaign built a six-month waiting list for \nthe MINI Cooper. Despite its relatively limited communication budget, the brand has continued \nto develop innovative, award-winning campaigns ever since. The MINI has especially used \noutdoor advertising creatively: Two curved palm trees planted next to a speeding MINI on a \nbillboard created an illusion of speed and power; a digital billboard personally greeted passing \nMINI drivers by using a signal from a radio chip embedded in their key fobs; and a real MINI on \nthe side of a building was able to move up and down like a yo-yo. A worldwide campaign, \u201cNot \nNormal,\u201d spotlights MINI\u2019s strong, independent character through classic and digital media.

Certain forms of advertising, such as TV, can require a large bud -\nget, whereas other forms, such as targeted online ads, do not. The mere presence of mass-media \nadvertising might have an effect on sales: Consumers might believe a heavily advertised brand \nmust be of good quality.13\n\u2022 Online and social media communication  involves online activities and programs designed to \nengage customers or prospects and directly or indirectly raise awareness, improve image, or elicit \nsales of products and services (websites, e-mails, search ads, display ads, company blogs, third-\nparty chat rooms, forums, Facebook and Twitter messages, and YouTube channels and videos). \nOnline marketing and messages can take many forms to interact with consumers when they are \nin active search mode or when they are just browsing and surfing online for something to do.\n\u2022 Mobile communication  is a special form of online communication that places messages on con -\nsumers\u2019 cell phones, smart phones, or tablets (text messages, online communication, and social \nmedia communication). Increasingly, online marketing and social media rely on mobile forms \nof communication such as smart phones or tablets. Mobile communication is timely \u2014messages \ncan be very time-sensitive and reflect when and where a consumer is\u2014and pervasive , meaning that \nmessages are always at consumers\u2019 fingertips.\n\u2022 Direct marketing  involves the use of mail, phone, e-mail, online messaging, or in-person inter -\naction to communicate directly with, or solicit response or dialog from, specific customers and \nprospects. The advent of data analytics has given marketers the opportunity to learn even more \nabout consumers and develop more personal and relevant marketing communications.\n\u2022 Events and experiences  are company-sponsored activities and programs designed to create \nbrand-related interactions with consumers. Examples include sports, arts, entertainment, festivals, \nfactory tours, company museums, and street activities, as well as events for causes and less formal \nactivities. Events and experiences offer many advantages as long as they are engaging  and implicit , \nmeaning that they involve indirect soft sell.\n\u2022 Word of mouth  involves the passing of information from person to person by oral commu -\nnication. Social media can be viewed as a specific instance of word of mouth, where personal \ncommunication occurs online and is observable by others. Marketers can influence naturally \noccurring word of mouth as well as help to create word of mouth by \u201cseeding\u201d a message that is \nlikely to engage consumers and lead to word-of-mouth communication related to the company \nand its offerings.\n\u2022 Publicity and public relations  involve a variety of programs directed internally to employees of \nthe company or externally to consumers, other firms, the government, and media to promote or \nprotect a company\u2019s image or its individual product communications (press kits, speeches, semi -\nnars, annual reports, charitable donations, publications, community relations, lobbying, identity \nmedia, and company magazines). Marketers tend to underuse publicity and public relations, yet a \nwell-thought-out program coordinated with the other elements of the communication mix can be \nextremely effective, especially if a company needs to challenge consumers\u2019 misconceptions. The \nappeal of public relations and publicity is based on its high credibility: News stories and features \nare more authentic and credible to readers than ads.\n\u2022 Personal selling  is a process in which a seller tries to convince a buyer to purchase a particular \nproduct or service. Personal selling typically involves face-to-face communication and is highly \ndependent on the persuasion skills and abilities of the seller. Personal selling often takes place in \none of two formats\u2014through retail, where a salesperson interacts with potential customers who \ncome to inquire about a product, and through direct-to-consumer marketing, where a salesperson \nvisits potential buyers to make them aware of a company\u2019s offering.\n\u2022 Packaging  is an effective form of communication, especially in the case of decisions that are made \nat the point of purchase.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4964, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca3a7ebf-abc6-418e-a131-cbc3fc04700f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca3a7ebf-abc6-418e-a131-cbc3fc04700f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37f28c2b-6cba-415f-8eff-1ddb4a23caae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "da04725e987a4f6a992242f929e9b9b50bf6f51d6bbe1a3b1c8adbc98f590c4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "48799596-10ac-4392-b6cb-a111d5504855", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "0d903d0bf617fe5d07226b2ec15bb9e82d5b3b627a69545cb558959cb644cf2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8a40852-bb8c-4a1b-90cc-917f7f220cb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "206e9a4571964e3b9f68b4380f996a33d3ebe5ebfa6b6b2f898a47a64ae3d68b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The \nappeal of public relations and publicity is based on its high credibility: News stories and features \nare more authentic and credible to readers than ads.\n\u2022 Personal selling  is a process in which a seller tries to convince a buyer to purchase a particular \nproduct or service.

Owned media  are communication channels that marketers actually own, such as \na company or brand brochure, product packaging, website, blog, Facebook page, or Twitter account. \nEarned media  are streams in which consumers, the press, or other outsiders voluntarily communicate \nsomething about the brand via word of mouth, buzz, or viral marketing methods.

These choices are critical: The average cost to produce a national 30-second television \ncommercial is about $300,000,16 so it can cost as much to run an ad once on network TV as to create \nand produce it! Media planners are using more sophisticated measures of effectiveness and employing \nthem in mathematical models to arrive at the best media mix.17\nMedia planners must consider factors such as audience size, composition, and media cost and \nthen calculate the cost per thousand persons reached. First, consider audience quality . For a baby lotion \nad, a magazine read by 1 million young parents has an exposure value of 1 million potential buyers; if \nread by 1 million teenagers, it has an exposure value of almost zero. Second, consider audience-attention \nprobability . Readers of some magazines may pay more attention to ads than do readers of others. Third \nis the medium\u2019s editorial quality , meaning its prestige and believability. People are more likely to believe \na TV or radio ad when it appears within a program they like. Fourth, consider the value of ad placement \npolicies and extra services , such as regional or occupational editions, as well as the lead-time requirements \nfor magazines.\nCommunication programs involve a range of different media that should seamlessly convey \nthe desired message to the target audience.

The advertiser seeks a specified \ncommunication objective and response from the target audience\u2014which usually involves the degree \nof brand awareness generated. The number of exposures needed to reach a certain level of audience \nawareness is contingent on the reach, frequency, and impact of the media chosen:\n\u2022 Reach (R).

The intent was to \nsupport the full range of products\u2014cranberry sauce, fruit juices, and dried cranberries in different \nforms\u2014and leverage the fact that the brand was born in the cranberry bogs and remains there \nstill. The authentic and perhaps surprising campaign, \u201cStraight from the Bog,\u201d was designed to \nalso reinforce two key brand benefits\u2014that Ocean Spray products taste good and are good for \nyou. PR played a crucial role. Miniature bogs were brought to Manhattan and featured on an NBC \nToday  morning segment. A \u201cBogs across America Tour\u201d brought the experience to Los Angeles \nand Chicago. Television and print advertising featured two growers (played by actors) standing \nwaist deep in a bog and talking, often humorously, about what they did. The campaign also \nincluded a website, in-store displays, and events for consumers and members of the growers\u2019 \ncooperative itself. Product innovation was crucial, too: New flavor blends were introduced, \nalong with a line of 100 percent juices in diet and light versions, and Craisins\u2014sweetened \ndried cranberries. Other elements included a pop-up restaurant in a bog created in New York\u2019s \nRockefeller Center, where winners of a Facebook cranberry-pairings contest were treated to \nappetizers and drinks made from Ocean Spray products. In addition, a leap-year promotion urged \nconsumers to \u201cleap\u201d to Craisins. The campaign hit the mark, lifting sales an average of 10 percent \nin its first five years, in spite of continued decline in the fruit juice category.18\nscreen.

Suppose the planner has a communication budget of $1,000,000, \nand the cost per thousand exposures of average quality is $5. This allows for 200,000,000 exposures \n($1,000,000,[$5/1,000]). If the advertiser seeks an average exposure frequency of 10, it can reach \n20,000,000 people (200,000,000,10) with the given budget. But if the advertiser wants higher-quality \nmedia costing $10 per thousand exposures, it will be able to reach only 10,000,000 people, unless it is \nwilling to lower the desired exposure frequency.\nThe relationship between reach, frequency, and impact is captured in the following concepts:\n\u2022 Total number of exposures (E).  This is the reach times the average frequency\u2014that is, E=R*F,  \nalso called the gross rating points  (GRP). If a given media schedule reaches 80 percent of homes with \nan average exposure frequency of 3, the media schedule has a GRP of   240 (80*3). If another \nmedia schedule has a GRP of 300, it has more weight, but we cannot tell how this weight breaks \ndown into reach and frequency.\n\u2022 Weighted number of exposures (WE).  This is the reach times average frequency, times average impact\u2014\nthat is, WE=R*F*I.\nReach is most important when launching new products, extensions of well-known brands, or infre -\nquently purchased brands, or when going after an undefined target market. Frequency is most impor -\ntant when there are strong competitors, a complex story to tell, high consumer resistance, or a frequent \npurchase cycle. A key reason for repetition is consumer forgetfulness. The higher the \u201cforgetting rate\u201d \nassociated with a brand, product category, or message, the higher the warranted level of repetition.21\nSelecting Media Timing and Allocation.  When choosing media, the advertiser must \nmake both a macroscheduling and a microscheduling decision. The macroscheduling decision  \nis related to seasons and the business cycle. Suppose 70 percent of a product\u2019s sales occur between \nJune and September. The firm can vary its communication expenditures to follow the seasonal pat -\ntern, to oppose the seasonal pattern, or to be constant throughout the year. The microscheduling \ndecision  calls for allocating communication expenditures within a short period to obtain maximum \nimpact. Suppose the firm decides to buy 30 radio spots in September. Communication messages \nfor the month can be concentrated, dispersed continuously throughout the month, or dispersed \nintermittently.\nThe chosen pattern should meet the marketer\u2019s communication objectives and consider three \nfactors. Buyer turnover  expresses the rate at which new buyers enter the market; the higher this rate, the \nmore continuous the communication should be. Purchase frequency  is the number of times the average \nconsumer buys the product during the period; the higher the purchase frequency, the more continuous \nthe communication should be. The forgetting rate  is the rate at which the buyer forgets the brand; the \nhigher the forgetting rate, the more continuous the communication should be.\nWhen launching a new product, the advertiser must choose among four strategies: continuity, \nconcentration, flighting, and pulsing.\n\u2022 Continuity  means exposures appear evenly throughout a given period. Generally, advertisers use \ncontinuous communication in expanding markets, with frequently purchased items, and in tightly \ndefined buyer categories.\n\u2022 Concentration  calls for spending all the communication dollars in a single period. This makes sense \nfor products with one selling season or one related holiday.\n\u2022 Flighting  calls for communication during a period, followed by a period with no communication, \nfollowed by a second period of communication activity. It is useful when funding is limited, the \npurchase cycle is relatively infrequent, or items are seasonal.\n\u2022 Pulsing  is continuous communication at low levels, reinforced periodically by waves of heavier \nactivity. It draws on the strengths of continuous communication and flighting to create a com -\npromise scheduling strategy. Those who favor pulsing believe it results in the audience learning \nthe message more thoroughly and at a lower cost to the firm.22\nA company must allocate its communication budget over space as well as over time. It makes \n\u201cnational buys\u201d when it places ads on national TV and radio networks or in nationally circulated \n magazines. It makes \u201cspot buys\u201d when it buys TV time in just a few markets or in regional editions of \nmagazines. These markets are also called areas of dominant influence .

Creative execution can be decisive.23\nDETERMINING THE MESSAGE APPEAL\nThe effectiveness of a communication depends on how well its message is expressed in addition to \nits content. If a communication is ineffective, it may mean the wrong message was used or the right \none was poorly expressed. Marketers use different creative strategies to translate their messages into \na specific communication. We can broadly classify them as either informational or transformational \nappeals.24\nInformational Appeals.  An informational appeal  elaborates on product or service attributes \nor benefits. Examples in advertising include problem-solution ads (Aleve offers the longest-lasting \nrelief for aches and pains); product demonstration ads (Thompson Water Seal can withstand intense \nrain, snow, and heat); product comparison ads (AT&T offers the largest 4G mobile network); and \ntestimonials from unknown or celebrity endorsers (NBA player LeBron James pitching McDonald\u2019s, \nNike, Samsung, Sprite, and others). Informational appeals assume strictly rational processing of the \ncommunication on the consumer\u2019s part. Logic and reason rule.\nAcademic research has shed light on informational appeals and their relationship to one-sided \nversus two-sided arguments. One might expect one-sided presentations that praise a product to be \nmore effective than two-sided arguments that also mention shortcomings. Yet two-sided messages may \nbe more appropriate, especially when negative associations must be overcome.25 Two-sided messages \nare more effective with better-educated audiences and those who are initially opposed.26\nThe order in which arguments are presented is also important.27 In a one-sided message, present -\ning the strongest argument first arouses attention and interest, which is important in media where the \naudience often does not attend to the whole message. With a captive audience, a climactic presentation \nmight be more effective. For a two-sided message, if the audience is initially opposed, it is better to start \nwith the other side\u2019s argument and conclude with your own strongest argument.\nTransformational Appeals.  A transformational appeal elaborates on a non\u2013product-related \nbenefit or image. It might depict the kind of person who uses a brand (VW advertised to active, youth -\nful people with its famed \u201cDrivers Wanted\u201d campaign) or the kind of experience that results from use \n(Pringles advertised \u201cOnce You Pop, the Fun Don\u2019t Stop\u201d for years). Transformational appeals often \nattempt to stir up emotions that will motivate purchase.28\nCommunicators use negative appeals such as fear, guilt, and shame to get people to do things \n(brush their teeth, have an annual health checkup) or stop doing things (smoking, abusing alcohol, \novereating). Fear appeals work best when they are not too strong, when source credibility is high, and \nwhen the communication promises, in a believable and efficient way, that the product or service will \nrelieve the fear it arouses. Messages are most persuasive when they moderately disagree with audience \nbeliefs. Stating only what the audience already believes at best merely reinforces beliefs, and messages \ntoo much at variance with those beliefs will be rejected.29\nCommunicators also use positive emotional appeals such as humor, love, pride, and joy. \n Motivational or \u201cborrowed interest\u201d devices\u2014such as cute babies, frisky puppies, popular music, and \nprovocative sex appeals\u2014are often employed to attract attention and raise involvement with an ad. \nThese techniques are thought necessary in the tough new media environment of low-involvement \nprocessing and competing messages. Attention-getting tactics may also detract from comprehension, \nhowever, and they can wear out their welcome fast or overshadow the product. Thus, one challenge is \nfiguring out how to break through the clutter and deliver the intended message.\nThe magic of advertising is to bring abstract concepts to life in the minds of the consumer target. \nIn a print ad, the communicator must decide on headline, copy, illustration, and color.30 For a radio \nmessage, the communicator must choose words, voice qualities, and vocalizations. The sound of an \nannouncer promoting a used automobile should be different from the sound of one promoting a new \nluxury car. If the message is to be carried on television or in person, all these elements plus body lan -\nguage must be planned. For the message to go online, the marketer must specify layout, fonts, graphics, \nand other visual and verbal information.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4777, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "684df1f0-0892-4e97-8ceb-b912c22e4101": {"__data__": {"id_": "684df1f0-0892-4e97-8ceb-b912c22e4101", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a42523db-ac27-4f6f-ab58-ca745c0a8850", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "c24a33f5f4166b96c83812d3bbbcd5e082c06bd6dfcf88d5b6b4b7d9fed6ed92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c285e8e-f7bb-4c58-9347-d55c80d813ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap12.pdf"}, "hash": "432ca96eb8123606ba61e176950b3b44e9b6a6cbfde3c5353640a921526dc6d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a08baa1-679f-4dd6-9827-2ed0a8417b08", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c5c6ee29ab4b84d3fb954c33478594052df8f105817440a3edcf2dd35aadd2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "276 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nSELECTING THE MESSAGE SOURCE\nResearch has shown that the credibility of the source is crucial to a message\u2019s acceptance. The three \nmost often identified characteristics of credibility are expertise, trustworthiness, and likability.31 \nExpertise  is the specialized knowledge the communicator possesses to back the claim being made. \nTrustworthiness  reflects how objective and honest the source is perceived to be. Friends are trusted \nmore than strangers or salespeople, and people who are not paid to endorse a product are viewed as \nmore trustworthy than people who are paid. Likability  describes the source\u2019s attractiveness, measured \nin terms of candor, humor, and naturalness.\nThe most credible source will score high on all three dimensions\u2014expertise, trustworthiness, and \nlikability. Pharmaceutical companies want doctors to testify about product benefits because doctors \nhave high credibility. Charles Schwab became the centerpiece of ads for his $4 billion-plus discount \nbrokerage firm via the \u201cTalk to Chuck\u201d and \u201cOwn Your Tomorrow\u201d corporate advertising campaigns \nthat stressed integrity and likability.\nMessages delivered by knowledgeable, trustworthy, and likable sources can achieve higher atten -\ntion and recall, which is why some advertisers use celebrities as spokespeople.32 \u201cMarketing Insight: \nCelebrity Endorsements\u201d focuses on the use of testimonials in a communication campaign. On the \nother hand, some marketers feature ordinary people to give their ads more realism and overcome \nconsumer skepticism. Ford featured actual customers being thrust into a press conference to describe \ntheir vehicles. Red Lobster used chefs from its restaurants to extol the virtues of its menu.33\nIf a person has a positive attitude toward a message and its source (or a negative attitude toward \nboth), a state of congruity  is said to exist. But what happens when a celebrity praises a brand that a con -\nsumer dislikes? Some researchers believe an attitude change will take place that increases the amount \nof congruity between the two evaluations.34 Thus, the consumer will end up respecting the celebrity \nsomewhat less or the brand somewhat more. If the consumer encounters the same celebrity praising \nother disliked brands, she will eventually develop a negative view of the celebrity and maintain negative \nattitudes toward the brands. The principle of congruity  implies that communicators can use their \ngood image to reduce some negative feelings toward a brand but that, in the process. they might lose \nsome esteem with the audience.\nDEVELOPING THE CREATIVE EXECUTION\nA practical tool to facilitate discussion about the creative output is given by the ADPLAN framework \ndeveloped by Kellogg School of Management advertising expert Derek Rucker.35 Once an agency or cre -\native team supplies a storyboard or advertising execution, ADPLAN helps a strategist consider important \nfactors that facilitate success and/or point out where missteps can take place. The ADPLAN acronym \nencompasses six dimensions: Attention, Distinction, Positioning, Linkage, Amplification, and Net Equity.\n\u2022 Attention  indicates whether an advertisement will garner interest from the target audience. This \nreflects both initial capture as well as sustained interest. For example, if a consumer who begins lis -\ntening to an ad airing on YouTube hits the \u201cskip ad\u201d message after five seconds, the ad has failed to \ncapture sufficient attention. and the company\u2019s message probably will not be heard. Recognizing \nthis problem, Geico created a 5-second advertisement that was not skippable. Other brands have \naddressed this issue by using engaging creative content that people want to watch to completion.\n\u2022 Distinction  assesses whether an advertisement uses themes, content, or creative devices that \ndistinguish it from other advertisements in the category or in general. For example, Apple\u2019s his -\ntoric \u201c1984\u201d Super Bowl ad, despite being aired only once, achieved massive distinction because \nit featured high production values that represented Apple as a hero in a technological dystopia. \nIn contrast, many local automotive commercials seem redundant.\n\u2022 Positioning  describes whether an advertisement situates the brand in the right category, provides \na strong benefit, and anchors the benefit with a reason for customers to believe the message.

Brands typically seek to elicit primarily positive \nthoughts from their target audience. Amplification of positive thoughts is important because \nthey can lead to the formation of favorable attitudes\u2014and ultimately to purchase.\n\u2022 Net equity  pertains to how an advertisement fits with a brand\u2019s heritage and established associa -\ntions. For example, the BMW brand is associated with high performance. As a consequence, one \nof BMW\u2019s objectives is to make sure that new advertisements do not threaten or undermine this \nequity.\nAlthough the ADPLAN tool is meant to guide strategic discussions of advertisements, each ele -\nment of the ADPLAN tool can be measured empirically. Thus the framework serves as a means to foster \ndeeper conversations around advertising, as well as to direct where test and measurement might occur. \nNote that the ADPLAN is meant to function as just one aspect of a strategist\u2019s effort to evaluate creative \noutput. Strategists must also develop a proper creative brief and consider the purpose of the advertise -\nment (for example, whether awareness or persuasion is the desired outcome), the appropriateness of \nthe media channel, and the company\u2019s advertising budget.36\nMeasuring Communication Effectiveness\nSenior managers want to know the outcomes  and revenues  resulting from their communication invest -\nments. Too often, however, their communication managers supply only inputs , like press clippings or \nthe number of ads, and expenses , like media costs. In fairness, communication managers try to translate \ninputs into intermediate outputs, such as reach and frequency (the percentage of the target market \nexposed to a communication and the number of exposures), recall and recognition scores, persuasion \nchanges, and cost-per-thousand calculations.\nAfter implementing the communication plan, marketers must measure its effectiveness. Research \non the impact of communication seeks to determine the degree to which a company\u2019s communication \nhas been effective in achieving its goals.37 Communication effectiveness can be measured from two \nperspectives: supply side and demand side.\nOn the supply side , measuring communication effectiveness aims to assess the media coverage\u2014for \nexample, the number of seconds the brand is clearly visible on a television screen or the column inches \nof press clippings that mention the brand.\nAlthough supply-side methods provide quantifiable measures, equating media coverage with \nadvertising exposure ignores the content of the respective communications.38 The advertiser uses media \nspace and time to communicate a strategically designed message. Media coverage and telecasts only \nexpose the brand and don\u2019t necessarily embellish its meaning in any direct way. Although some public \nrelations professionals maintain that positive editorial coverage can be worth five to 10\u00a0times the \nequivalent advertising value, sponsorship rarely provides such favorable treatment.\nOn the demand side , measuring communication effectiveness aims to assess the effect a com -\npany\u2019s campaign has on the target audience. To this end, members of the target audience are \nasked whether they recognize or recall the message, how many times they saw it, what points \nthey recall, how they felt about the message, what their previous attitudes toward the product \nand the company were, and what their current attitudes are.\nFor example, marketers can survey spectators to measure their recall of the event and their \nresulting attitudes and intentions toward the sponsor. Many advertisers use posttests to assess \nthe overall impact of a completed campaign. If a company hoped to increase brand awareness \nfrom 20 percent to 50 percent and succeeded in increasing it only to 30 percent, then it is not \nspending enough, its ads are poor, or it has overlooked some other factor. Marketers also collect \nbehavioral measures of audience response, such as how many people bought the product, liked \nit, and talked to others about it. Thus, most advertisers try to measure the communication effect \nof an ad\u2014that is, its potential impact on awareness, knowledge, or preference.\nCompanies often examine the effectiveness of their communication campaigns to deter -\nmine whether they are overspending or underspending on advertising.

Proponents maintain \nthat useful diagnostic information can emerge from pretests but that they should not be used as the \nsole decision criterion. Nike, widely acknowledged as one of the best advertisers around, is known for \ndoing very little ad pretesting.\nIn addition to pretesting their communication campaigns, marketers might measure whether and \nhow the communication campaign influences sales. Researchers can measure sales impact with the \nhistorical approach , which uses advanced statistical techniques to correlate past sales to past advertising \nexpenditures. Other researchers use experimental data  to measure advertising\u2019s sales impact. A grow -\ning number of researchers measure the sales effect  of advertising expenditures, instead of settling for \nmeasures of communication effect.40 Millward Brown International has conducted tracking studies \nfor years to help advertisers decide whether their advertising is benefiting their brand.\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\nPaul Casey, and Stewart Cink have helped to design, \nprototype, and test new golf clubs and balls at Nike Golf\u2019s \nresearch and development facility.

A host of movie and TV stars do \nuncredited commercial voice-overs, including Jon Hamm \n(Mercedes-Benz), Morgan Freeman (Visa), Matt Damon \n(TD Ameritrade), Jeff Bridges (Duracell), and George \nClooney (Budweiser). Although advertisers assume that \nsome viewers will recognize the voices, the main rationale \nfor using them is the actors\u2019 incomparable voice talent \nand skill.\nUsing celebrities poses certain risks. The celebrity \nmight hold out for a larger fee at contract renewal or might \neven withdraw. And just like movies and album releases, \ncelebrity campaigns can be expensive flops. The celeb-\nrity might lose popularity or, even worse, get caught in a \nscandal or embarrassing situation, as did Tiger Woods, \nMichael Phelps, and Lance Armstrong. Besides carefully \nchecking endorsers\u2019 backgrounds, some marketers are \nchoosing to use more than one to reduce their brand\u2019s \nexposure to any single person\u2019s flaws.\nAnother solution is for marketers to create their own \nbrand celebrities. Dos Equis beer, imported from Mexico, \nboosted U.S. sales by more than 20 percent during the \nlast recession by riding on the popularity of its \u201cMost \nInteresting Man in the World\u201d ad campaign. Suave and \ndebonair, with a distinct voice and a silver beard, the \ncharacter has hundreds of thousands of Facebook friends, \ndespite being completely fictitious. Videos of his exploits \nlog millions of views on YouTube. Dos Equis has made it \npossible for customers to \u201ccall\u201d him and listen to a series \nof automated voicemail messages.41A well-chosen celebrity can draw attention to a product \nor brand\u2014as Priceline found when it picked Star Trek  icon \nWilliam Shatner to star in campy ads reinforcing its low-\nprice image.

Designing effective communication requires making \nthree key decisions: what to say (message strategy), \nhow to say it (creative strategy), and who should say \nit ( message source). Communication channels can be \npersonal (advocate, expert, and social channels) or \n nonpersonal (media, atmosphere, and events).\n7. Although other methods exist, the objective-and-task \nmethod of setting the communication budget, which \ncalls on marketers to develop their budgets by defining \nspecific objectives, is typically the most effective.\n8. In choosing the marketing communication mix, \n marketers must examine the distinct advantages and \ncosts of each communication tool and the company\u2019s \nmarket rank. They must also consider the type of \n market in which they are selling, how ready consumers \nare to make a purchase, and the offering\u2019s stage in the \ncompany, brand, and product life cycle.\n9. Measuring the effectiveness of the marketing com -\nmunication mix requires asking members of the target \naudience whether they recognize or recall the commu -\nnication, how many times they saw it, what points they \nrecall, how they felt about the communication, what \ntheir previous attitudes toward the company, brand, and \nproduct were, and what those attitudes are now.summary\n1. Modern marketing calls for more than developing a \ngood product, pricing it attractively, and making it \naccessible to target customers. Companies must also \ncommunicate with current and potential stakeholders \nand with the general public.\n2. The marketing communication mix consists of nine \nmajor modes of communication: advertising, online and \nsocial media, mobile communication, direct marketing, \nevents and experiences, word of mouth, publicity and \npublic relations, personal selling, and packaging.\n3. The communication process consists of nine elements: \nsender, receiver, message, media, encoding, decoding, \nresponse, feedback, and noise. To get their messages \nthrough, marketers must take into account how the tar -\nget audience usually decodes messages. They must also \ntransmit the message through efficient media that reach \nthe target audience and develop feedback channels to \nmonitor response to the message.\n4. Developing effective communication requires eight \nsteps: (1) identify the target audience, (2) choose the \ncommunication objectives, (3) design the communica -\ntion, (4) select the communication channels, (5) set the \ntotal communication budget, (6) choose the communi -\ncation mix, (7) measure the communication results, and \n(8) manage the integrated marketing communication \nprocess.\n5.

However, Queensland is \nlocated far away from major cities such as Melbourne and \nAfter enjoying domestic success, Red Bull in 1992 \nexpanded outside of Austria to Hungary and Slovenia. Red \nBull continued its international expansion to Germany and \nSwitzerland shortly after. Five years later, Red Bull began \nselling in the United States. Despite its popularity in Austria, \nRed Bull initially found limited success in these new markets, \nbecause it was one of the first beverages to be labeled as an \nenergy drink. Many customers were unsure of when and why \nthey should drink Red Bull.\nTo address costumer confusion, Red Bull focused its \nproduct positioning around an adventurous lifestyle. Red Bull \nemployed extensive advertisements that featured the famous \nslogan \u201cRed Bull gives you wings\u201d to make the beverage and \nits effects better-known in newer markets. In 1995, Red Bull \nbegan sponsoring athletes and teams in various sports across \nthe world, and in just a couple of years, its list of sponsorships \nhad grown to hundreds of athletes as well as many teams \nand sporting events. The company became very active in the \nmotorsports scene and sponsored a racing team in Formula \nOne, which at the time attracted one of the highest annual tele -\nvision audiences of all sporting events. Years later, the company \npurchased its own Formula One team. The Red Bull F1 team \neventually became one of the most successful racing teams \nin the world, garnering four successive championships from \n2010 to 2013. Red Bull has expanded its list of sports sponsor -\nships and ownership to include, among others,  NASCAR, the \nNFL, football, BMX, motocross, and  skateboarding. Red Bull\u2019s \nendeavors in sponsoring international athletes and sporting \nevents helped make Red Bull a global brand.\nIn addition to sports marketing, Red Bull has invested \nheavily in content marketing to promote the drink and its \nassociated lifestyle. Red Bull established the Red Bull Media \nHouse, a collection of media companies that create content \nin magazines, films and television, video games, social media, \nand music. The various platforms have released thousands \nof photos, videos, and articles of people and ideas that align \nwith the image the Red Bull brand promotes. Fans are also \nencouraged to upload their own content showcasing the Red Bull lifestyle. Red Bull Media House released a feature \nfilm called The Art of Flight  that quickly rose to the top of the \niTunes chart. Red Bull\u2019s in-house record company has helped \nbring fame to artists such as AWOLNATION and Twin Atlantic. \nThe company\u2019s own publication, The Red Bulletin , reported a \ndistribution of over five million magazines in 2017. The social \nmedia team of the Red Bull Media House has released numer -\nous viral videos showcasing the action sports lifestyle of Red \nBull users on its own YouTube channel. With over five million \nsubscribers, Red Bull\u2019s YouTube channel is home to thou -\nsands of featurettes on Red Bull athletes and sporting events. \nRed Bull\u2019s content marketing has pushed awareness of its \nbrand to greater heights and has further increased the asso -\nciation between an active lifestyle and the company.\nRed Bull\u2019s nontraditional approach to marketing has \nmade the company one of the world\u2019s most recognized \nbrands.

The greatest \nchallenge that Tourism Queensland identified was building \ninternational awareness. To do this, Tourism Queensland \ntasked marketing agency SapientNitro in 2009 with creating \na  successful global advertising campaign on a limited budget \nof $1.2 million.\nSapientNitro came up with its now-legendary \u201cThe Best \nJob in the World\u201d campaign. The campaign consisted of \nTourism Queensland advertising an opening for the position \nof \u201cIsland Caretaker.\u201d Applicants needed no previous work \nexperience, and their only duty was to write a single blog \npost about the islands once a week. The lucky applicant \nselected would receive free living accommodations on the \nisland and a six-figure salary for six months. The position \nwas billed as \u201cThe Best Job in the World,\u201d and interested \n candidates had to upload a 60-second application video on \nTourism Queensland\u2019s website.\nTo create international publicity, Tourism Queensland \ninvited influential travel journalists and bloggers from across \nthe globe to the islands and held a media conference that \nfeatured a luxury villa and a sunny tropical paradise. The \nchange in scenery was a stark contrast to many of the \n conference attendees in the Northern Hemisphere, who were \nexperiencing a cold, dark winter.\nPublic interest in the advertisement campaign exploded \nshortly afterward. Within one day of launch, the website \nreceived over 200,000 website views. Within the six-week \napplication period, Tourism Queensland received over \n34,000\u00a0applicants from nearly 200 countries. The website \nhad drawn over 6.8 million unique monthly visitors, who \ngenerated approximately 54 million page views and spent an \nextremely high average of 8.25 minutes viewing the website. \nMore than 46,000 mainstream media articles were  written \nabout the promotion. In total, it was estimated that the \n campaign had reached nearly 3 billion people worldwide.\nThe $1.2 million campaign had exceeded Tourism \nQueensland\u2019s wildest expectations. Three main reasons help explain to why the low-budget promotion resulted in \nexplosive numbers of views. For one thing, the promotion \nwas hosted almost exclusively on their website. Whereas \n$1.2 million could have purchased only a small amount of TV \nadvertisement time, the money invested resulted in a website \nthat reached across the globe with ease. Second, the over -\nwhelming majority of the content in the advertising campaign \nwas provided by the numerous applicants, who submitted \nover 550 hours of videos to the website; none of them were \ncreated by the SapientNitro or Tourism Queensland teams. \nThe most notable applicants received millions of views on \nYouTube and widespread social media attention. The popu-\nlarity of these videos persisted even after the application \nperiod ended. Third, Tourism Queensland earned media cov-\nerage, instead of having to buy it. Media companies assumed \nthe responsibility of following top candidates and telling \ntheir story. BBC Television created a one-hour documentary \nfeaturing the final 16 candidates in the competition, which \nreceived the highest viewer ratings during the week of its \nrelease in the U k.\nThe winner of the competition was a British man named \nBen Southall. After receiving the job, Southall conducted \nthe largest number of interviews in a 24-hour period at the \ntime\u2014124 in TV broadcasts all over the world. During his six-\nmonth position, Southall was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey \nand was featured in a six-part National Geographic series. \nSouthall became an ambassador for Queensland tourism \nafter his position ended. In total, the clever advertising cam-\npaign generated over $250 million in media value and brought \nworldwide attention to Queensland tourism. \u201cThe Best Job in \nthe World\u201d received 8 Cannes Lions awards for distinguished \ncreativity in advertising and marketing and was inducted into \nPR News\u2019s Platinum Hall of Fame in 2014.43\nQuestions\n1.
