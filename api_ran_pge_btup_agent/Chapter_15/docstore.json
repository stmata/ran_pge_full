Leon Leonwood Bean, returned from a Maine hunting trip in 1911 with \ncold, damp feet\u2014and a revolutionary idea for stitching leather uppers to workmen\u2019s rubber \nboots to create a comfortable, functional boot. Bean sent a three-page flier to a mailing list of \nhunters describing the benefits of his new Maine Hunting Shoe and backing it with a complete \n guarantee. The shoe was not an initial success. Of the first 100 pairs ordered, 90 were returned \nwhen the\u00a0tops and bottoms separated. True to his word, Bean refunded the purchase price and \nfixed the problem. L.L.Bean quickly became known as a trusted source for reliable outdoor Successful value creation needs successful value delivery. Instead of limiting their focus to \ntheir immediate suppliers, distributors, and customers, holistic marketers are examining the \nwhole supply chain as a value network, including their suppliers\u2019 suppliers upstream and their \ndistributors\u2019 customers downstream. They are also looking at how technology is changing the \nway customers shop and retailers sell and finding new and different means to distribute and ser -\nvice their offerings.

The company\u2019s guarantee of 100 percent satisfaction is still  \nat the core of its  business, as is its original Golden Rule: \u201cSell good merchandise at a  \nreasonable profit, treat your customers like human beings, and they will always come back  \nfor more. \u201d The generous return policy, allowing shoppers to return used products or exchange \nthem for brand new ones at any time, helped attract many customers. Over the years, however, \nan  increasing number of  opportunists began taking advantage of the policy\u2014for example,  \nby  purchasing old and damaged L.L.Bean products in second-hand markets and returning them \nfor a full refund. In\u00a0response, L.L.Bean was forced to revise its 102-year-old policy, citing more \nthan $250\u00a0  million in losses in five years from abuses of its liberal return policy. The updated \n guarantee gives  customers one year to return products, with a receipt required. Although the \nnew policy is on a par with some other outdoor retailers, L.L.Bean has experienced backlash \nfrom customers for scrapping the prized unlimited-return policy.1\nWith the advent of e-commerce (selling online) and m-commerce (selling via mobile devices), \ncustomers are buying in ways they never have before. Companies today must build and manage \na continuously evolving and increasingly complex channel system and value network. In this \n chapter, we consider strategic and tactical issues in integrating marketing channels and develop -\ning value  networks.\u00a0We will examine marketing channel issues from the perspective of retailers \nin Chapter 17.\nThe Role of Distribution Channels\nMost producers do not sell their goods directly to the final users; between them stand a set of interme -\ndiaries performing a variety of functions. These intermediaries constitute a marketing channel (also \ncalled a trade channel or distribution channel). Distribution channels  are sets of interdependent \norganizations participating in the process of making a product or service available for use or con -\nsumption. They are the set of pathways a product or service follows after production, culminating in \npurchase and consumption by the final end user.2\nSome intermediaries\u2014such as wholesalers and retailers\u2014buy, take title to, and resell the mer -\nchandise; these intermediaries are called merchants .

One of the chief roles of marketing channels is to \nconvert potential buyers into profitable customers. Marketing channels must not just serve  markets, \nthey must also make  them.\nThe channels chosen affect all other marketing decisions. The company\u2019s pricing depends on \nwhether it uses online discounters or high-quality boutiques. Its sales force and advertising decisions \ndepend on how much training and motivation dealers need. In addition, channel decisions include \nrelatively long-term commitments with other firms, as well as a set of policies and procedures. When \nan automaker signs up independent dealers to sell its automobiles, it cannot buy them out the next \nday and replace them with company-owned outlets. But at the same time, channel choices themselves \ndepend on the company\u2019s marketing strategy. Holistic marketers ensure that marketing decisions in \nall these different areas are made to maximize value overall.\nWhy does a producer delegate some of the selling job to intermediaries, relinquishing control over \nhow and to whom its products are sold? Through their contacts, experience, specialization, and scale of \noperation, intermediaries make goods widely available and accessible to target markets, offering more \neffectiveness and efficiency than the producing firm could achieve on its own.\nMany producers lack the financial resources and expertise to sell directly to their customers. The \nWilliam Wrigley Jr. Company would not find it practical to establish small retail gum shops throughout \nthe world or to sell gum online or by mail order. It is easier to work through the extensive network of \nprivately owned distribution organizations. Even Ford would be hard pressed to replace all the tasks \ndone by its 8,000+ dealer outlets worldwide.\nDISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FUNCTIONS\nA distribution channel performs the work of moving goods from producers to consumers. It over -\ncomes the time and place gaps that separate goods and services from those who need or want them. \nMembers of the marketing channel perform a number of key functions:\n\u2022 Gather information about potential and current customers, competitors, and other actors and \nforces in the marketing environment.\n\u2022 Develop and disseminate persuasive communications to stimulate purchasing and foster brand \nloyalty.\n\u2022 Negotiate and reach agreements on price and other terms so that transfer of ownership or pos -\nsession can be effected.\n\u2022 Place orders with manufacturers.\n\u2022 Acquire the funds to finance inventories at different levels in the marketing channel.\n\u2022 Assume risks connected with carrying out channel work.\n\u2022 Provide buyers with financing and facilitate payment.\n\u2022 Provide for buyers\u2019 payment of their bills through banks and other financial institutions.\n\u2022 Oversee actual transfer of ownership of goods from one organization or person to another.\nAll channel functions have three characteristics in common: They use up scarce resources, \nthey can often be performed better through specialization, and they can be shifted among chan -\nnel members. Channel functions can be illustrated in terms of flows of goods and services across \ndistribution channels. Five of the most common flows are illustrated in Figure 15.1. If these flows \nwere superimposed in one diagram, we would see the tremendous complexity of even simple mar -\nketing channels.\nMany of the channel functions involve bi-directional flows of goods and services. Some of these \nfunctions (storage and movement, title, and communications) constitute a forward flow  of activity from \nthe company to the customer; others (ordering and payment) constitute a backward flow  from cus -\ntomers to the company. Still others (information, negotiation, finance, and risk taking) occur in both \ndirections.\nThe question for marketers is not whether  various channel functions need to be performed\u2014they \nmust be\u2014but, rather, who is to perform them. Shifting some functions to intermediaries lowers the pro -\nducer\u2019s costs and prices, but the intermediary must add a charge to cover its work. If the intermediaries \nare more efficient than the manufacturer, prices to consumers should be lower. If consumers perform \nsome functions themselves, they should enjoy even lower prices. Changes in channel institutions thus \nlargely reflect the discovery of more efficient ways to combine or separate the economic functions that \nprovide assortments of goods to target customers.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4515, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed2c83fa-21d2-48c4-aef2-210adc1a2cbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed2c83fa-21d2-48c4-aef2-210adc1a2cbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0649bf4c-8c3b-4b5d-a86e-175bede974df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "2dee143d502d5ac0276d41afbd51f2143874d8f3772f6a1ebb07e04912b6807f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da59b45f-db7b-4224-9b9d-37be4eb26da0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "1dfaec2eb5701327a7578eb25b563d94f82718cc0f429dd6f5ecbde9d95d355b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06e5893d-a368-44b6-bcfb-4a2bcfc2cc76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6b27aa4a93f8dc6f7d9c0132b9c208d7c7e059195bcb62e359d9fa94f98137f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  325\nCHANNEL LEVELS\nDistribution channels can be described by the number of intermediaries that exist between the pro -\nducer and the final customer. The number of intermediaries, also referred to as channel levels, define \nthe length and breadth of the distribution channel. Figure 15.2(a) illustrates several consumer-goods \nmarketing channels of different lengths.\nA zero-level channel , also called a direct marketing channel , consists of a manufacturer selling \ndirectly to the final customer. The major examples are mail order, online selling, TV selling, telemarket -\ning, door-to-door sales, home parties, and manufacturer-owned stores. Traditionally, Franklin Mint \nsold collectibles through mail order; Red Envelope sold gifts online; Time-Life sold music and video \ncollections through TV commercials or longer infomercials; nonprofits and political organizations \nand candidates used the telephone to raise funds; Avon sales representatives sold cosmetics door to \ndoor; Tupperware sold its containers via in-home parties; and Apple sold computers and other con -\nsumer electronics through its own stores. Many of these firms now sell directly to customers online \nand via catalogs. Even traditional consumer-product firms are considering adding direct-to-consumer \ne-commerce sites to their channel mix. Kimberly-Clark has launched an online Kleenex Shop in the \nUnited Kingdom.\nA single-level channel  contains one selling intermediary, such as a retailer. A dual-level  channel  \ncontains two intermediaries, typically a wholesaler and a retailer. In Japan, where density of the urban \npopulation is high and retail outlets are fragmented, food distribution may include as many as six \nlevels! Obtaining information about end users and exercising control become more difficult for the \nproducer as the number of channel levels increases.\nFigure 15.2(b) shows channels commonly used in B2B marketing. An industrial-goods manufac -\nturer can use its sales force to sell directly to industrial customers, or it can sell to industrial distribu -\ntors who sell to industrial customers, or it can sell through manufacturers\u2019 representatives or its own \nsales branches directly to industrial customers or indirectly to industrial customers through industrial \ndistributors. Zero-, one-, and two-level marketing channels are quite common.\nChannels normally describe a forward movement of products from source to user, but reverse-\nflow channels  are also important. Reverse-flow channels perform several important functions, such \nas to reuse products or containers (such as refillable chemical-carrying drums), refurbish products for \nresale (such as circuit boards or computers), recycle products, and dispose of products and packaging.

HP uses its sales force to sell to large \naccounts, outbound telemarketing to sell to medium-sized accounts, direct mail with an inbound \nphone number to sell to small accounts, retailers to sell to still smaller accounts, and the internet to \nsell specialty items. Each channel can target a different segment of buyers, or different need states for \none buyer, to deliver the right products in the right places in the right way at the least cost.3\nWhen different channels target the same customers, channel conflict, excessive cost, or insuf -\nficient demand can result. Dial-a-Mattress successfully grew for three decades by selling mattresses \ndirectly over the phone and later online. A major expansion into 50 brick-and-mortar stores in major \nmetro areas was a failure, however. Secondary locations, chosen because management considered \nprime locations too expensive, could not generate enough customer traffic. The company eventually \ndeclared bankruptcy.4\nOn the other hand, when a major catalog and internet retailer invested significantly in brick-and-\nmortar stores, different results emerged. Customers near the store purchased through the catalog less \nfrequently, but their online purchases were unchanged. As it turned out, customers who liked to spend \ntime browsing were happy to either use a catalog or visit the store; those channels were interchange -\nable. Customers who shopped online, on the other hand, were more transaction focused and interested \nin efficiency, so they were less affected by the introduction of stores. Returns and exchanges at the \nstores were found to increase because of ease and accessibility, but extra purchases made by customers \nreturning or exchanging at the store offset any revenue deficit.5\nResearch has shown that multichannel customers can be more valuable to marketers.6 Nordstrom \nfound that its multichannel customers spend four times as much as those who shop only through one \nchannel, though some academic research suggests that this effect is stronger for hedonic products \n(apparel and cosmetics) than for functional products (office and garden supplies).7\nMost companies today have adopted multichannel marketing. Disney sells its videos through \nmultiple channels: movie rental merchants such as Netflix and Redbox, Disney Stores (owned and run \nby The Children\u2019s Place), retail stores such as Best Buy, online retailers such as Disney\u2019s own online \nstores and Amazon.com, the Disney Club catalog and other catalog sellers, as well as its subscription \nstreaming service Disney+. This variety affords Disney maximum market coverage and enables it to \noffer its videos at a number of price points.\nSometimes a company chooses a new or unconventional channel because of the difficulty, cost, or \nineffectiveness of working with the dominant channel. When video rental stores were rapidly declining, FIGURE 15.2 \nConsumer and \nIndustrial Marketing \nChannels(a) Consumer Marketing Channels\nRetailer\n Retailer\nWholesaler0-level 0-level 1-level 1-level 2-level 2-level\nManufacturer\n Manufacturer\n Manufacturer\nConsumer\n Consumer\n Consumer(b) Industrial Marketing Channels\nManufacturer\n Manufacturer\n Manufacturer\nIndustrial\ndistributors\nIndustrial\ncustomer\nIndustrial\ncustomer\nIndustrial\ncustomer\nManufacturer's\nrepresentative", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3708, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7df6eae-5f7b-42de-9488-056a6ee4809b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7df6eae-5f7b-42de-9488-056a6ee4809b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f23680e5-6e74-4716-b703-aed02a04bbde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "f995cc6d73217d697c0401625f5bf19c6dd0a3fdda3c05f9304f200fa4e48e9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06e5893d-a368-44b6-bcfb-4a2bcfc2cc76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "eb3355a7c12090413f7782f4e3402bbc6a70e43d86d544ec9726a77d0b55da18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71a8caa6-4899-48c8-ad51-a29c38c8359e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8aeebdd2bc5717704be5bc072157e30536bcc7361fcb0a94c8f9d31717b914cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  327\nCoinstar successfully introduced the Redbox chain of conveniently located DVD- and game-rental \nkiosks. Netflix quickly moved away from the revolutionary channel that brought it much success\u2014\ndirect mail\u2014to capitalize on a new one.\nCompanies are increasingly employing digital distribution strategies, selling directly online to cus -\ntomers or through e-merchants who have their own websites. In doing so, these companies are seeking \nto ensure that different channels work seamlessly together and match each target customer\u2019s preferred \nways of doing business, delivering the right product information and customer service regardless of \nwhether customers are online, in the store, or on the phone.\nUsing multiple distribution channels gives companies three important benefits. The first is \nincreased market coverage. Not only are more customers able to shop for the company\u2019s products \nin more places, as noted previously, but those who buy in more than one channel are often more \nprofitable than single-channel customers.8 The second benefit is lower channel cost. Selling online \nor by catalog and phone is cheaper than using personal selling to reach small customers. The\u00a0third is \nthe ability to do more customized selling\u2014such as by adding a technical sales force to sell  complex \nequipment.\nUsing a single channel is typically not very efficient. Consider a direct sales force. A salesperson \nwould have to find leads, qualify them, presell, close the sale, provide service, and manage account \ngrowth. With an integrated multichannel approach, however, the company\u2019s marketing department \ncould run a preselling campaign informing prospects about the company\u2019s products through advertis -\ning, direct mail, and e-mails; generate leads through telemarketing, more e-mails, and trade shows; and \nqualify leads as hot, warm, or cool. The salesperson enters when the prospect is ready to talk business \nand invests his or her costly time primarily in closing the sale. This multichannel architecture optimizes \ncoverage, customization, and control while minimizing cost and conflict.\nThere is a trade-off, however. New channels typically introduce conflict and problems with control \nand cooperation. Two or more may end up competing for the same customers.9 Clearly, companies \nneed to think through their channel architecture and determine which channels should perform which \nfunctions.10\nManaging the online and offline channels has thus become a priority for many firms.11 There are \nat least three strategies for trying to gain acceptance from intermediaries. One option involves offer -\ning different brands or products online and offline. The second option entails offering offline partners \nhigher commissions to cushion the negative impact on sales. The third option involves taking orders \non the website but having retailers deliver and collect payment. Harley-Davidson decided to tread \ncarefully before going online.\nHarley-Davidson  Given that harley-Davidson sells more than $1 billion worth of parts and \naccessories and general merchandise to its loyal followers\u2014generating roughly a quarter of its \nannual revenue\u2014an online venture to reach even more customers was an obvious next step. the \ncompany needed to be careful, however, to avoid the wrath of its 850 dealers who benefit from \nhigh margins on their sales. Its solution was to prompt online customers to select a participating \nharley dealer from which to purchase, ensuring that the dealer remains the focal point of the \ncustomer experience. Dealers, in turn, agreed to a number of standards, such as checking for \norders twice a day and shipping promptly. In-store pickup is also an option, and some products \nare available only in-store.12\nCompanies should use different sales channels for different-sized business customers\u2014a direct \nsales force for large customers, a digital strategy or telemarketing for midsize customers, and dis -\ntributors for small customers\u2014but should be alert for conflict over account ownership. For example, \nterritory-based sales representatives may want credit for all sales in their territories, regardless of the \nmarketing channel used.\nMultichannel marketers also need to decide how much of their product to offer in each of the \nchannels. Patagonia views the Web as the ideal channel for showing off its entire line of goods, given \nthat limited space at its retail locations means they can offer only a selection, and even its catalog \npromotes less than 70 percent of its total merchandise.13 Other marketers prefer to limit their online \nofferings, theorizing that customers look to websites and catalogs for a \u201cbest of\u201d array of merchandise \nand don\u2019t want to have to click through dozens of pages.

After a company \nhas chosen a channel system, it must select, train, motivate, and evaluate intermediaries for each \nchannel. It must also modify channel design and arrangements over time, including the possibility \nof expansion into international markets.\nESTABLISHING CHANNEL OBJECTIVES\nMarketers should state their channel objectives in terms of the customers they aim to reach, the ser -\nvice output levels they want to provide, and the associated cost and support levels. Under competitive \nconditions, channel members should arrange their functional tasks to minimize costs and still provide \ndesired levels of service. Usually, planners can identify several market segments based on desired \nservice and choose the best channels for each.\nConsumers may choose the channels they prefer based on price, product assortment, and \n convenience, as well as their own shopping goals (economic, social, or experiential).15 However, the \nsame consumer may choose different channels for different reasons.16 Some consumers are willing \nto \u201ctrade up\u201d to retailers offering higher-end goods such as TAG Heuer watches or Callaway golf clubs \nand \u201ctrade down\u201d to discount retailers for private-label paper towels, detergent, or vitamins. Others \nmay browse a catalog before visiting a store or test-drive a car at a dealership before ordering online.\nChannel objectives vary with product characteristics. Bulky products, such as building materi -\nals, require channels that minimize the shipping distance and the amount of handling. Nonstandard \nproducts such as custom-built machinery are sold directly by sales representatives. Products requir -\ning installation or maintenance services, such as heating and cooling systems, are usually sold and \nmaintained by the company or by franchised dealers. High-unit-value products such as generators and \nturbines are often sold through a company sales force rather than intermediaries.\nMarketers must adapt their channel objectives to the larger environment. When economic con -\nditions are depressed, producers want to move goods to market using shorter channels and without \nservices that add to the final price. Legal regulations and restrictions also affect channel design. For \nexample, U.S. law looks unfavorably on channel arrangements that substantially lessen competition \nor create a monopoly.\nWhen entering new markets, firms often closely observe what other firms are doing. Auchan, a \nFrench retailer with over 3,000 retail outlets worldwide, considered the presence of its French rivals \nLeclerc and Casino in Poland as key to its decision to enter that market also.17 Apple\u2019s channel objec -\ntive of creating a dynamic retail experience for consumers was not being met by existing channels, so \nit chose to open its own stores.across channels, the specific icons and information used in ratings and reviews on REI.com \nalso appear on in-store product displays. Like many retailers, REI has found that dual-channel \nshoppers spend significantly more than single-channel shoppers, and tri-channel shoppers spend \neven more. For example, one of every three people who buy something online will spend an \nadditional $90 in the store when they come to pick up that purchase.14\nApple Stores  When Apple launched its stores in 2001, many questioned its prospects; \nBusinessWeek  published an article titled \u201cSorry Steve, here\u2019s Why Apple Stores Won\u2019t Work.\u201d \nJust five years later, the company was celebrating the launch of its spectacular Manhattan \nshowcase. there are more than 500 Apple retail stores in operation around the world, which \nemploy over 50,000 people. over 1 million customers visit Apple stores each day worldwide, more \nthan double the attendance at all the Disney theme Parks around the world combined.18 Annual \nsales per square foot were significantly higher than those of tiffany, Coach, and Best Buy.

Consider the negative impression customers would \nget of McDonald\u2019s, Shell Oil, or Mercedes-Benz if one or more of their outlets or dealers consistently \nappeared dirty, inefficient, or unpleasant.\nTo facilitate channel member selection, producers should determine what characteristics distin -\nguish the better intermediaries\u2014number of years in business, other lines carried, growth and profit \nrecord, financial strength, cooperativeness, and service reputation. If the intermediaries are sales \nagents, producers should evaluate the number and character of other lines carried and the size and \nquality of the sales force. If the intermediaries are department stores that want exclusive distribution, \nthen their locations, future growth potential, and type of clientele will matter.\nIdentifying Major Channel Alternatives.  Each channel\u2014from sales force to agents, \ndistributors, dealers, direct mail, telemarketing, and traditional retailers\u2014has unique strengths and \nweaknesses. Sales forces can handle complex products and transactions, but they are expensive. Online \nretailing is inexpensive but may not be as effective for complex products. Distributors can create sales, \nbut the company loses direct contact with customers. Several clients can share the cost of manufactur -\ners\u2019 reps, but the selling effort is less intense than company reps provide.\nBased on the number of intermediaries, there are three core distribution strategies: exclusive , selec-\ntive, and intensive  distribution. We discuss these strategies next.\nExclusive distribution  severely limits the number of intermediaries. It\u2019s appropriate when the \nproducer wants to ensure more knowledgeable and dedicated efforts by the resellers, and it often of charge. Apple\u2019s meticulous attention to detail is reflected in the preloaded music and photos \non demo devices, innovative touches such as roving credit-card swipers to minimize checkout \nlines, and hours invested in employee training. Employees receive no sales commissions and \nhave no sales quotas. they are told their mission is to \u201chelp customers solve problems.\u201d Although \nthe stores initially upset existing Apple retailers and authorized service providers, the company \nworked hard to smooth relationships, in part justifying its decision as a natural evolution of its \nonline sales channel.19>> Apple created a \ndynamic atmosphere \nin which to experience \nits full line of products \nby opening its own \nstores, where the focus \nof the sales staff is to \nhelp  customers solve \nproblems.\nSource: olaf Schuelke/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3060, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f300d445-6dff-4ce4-9f54-ef6fdf06d4a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f300d445-6dff-4ce4-9f54-ef6fdf06d4a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70a05cf1-cd01-488c-a2eb-2a9583d0ce5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "a9ffffa97ae82fd2c308277cca6458629a63f8f8f77884318e9417cc126f0436", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02bf03b3-23fe-44c2-87f3-2769ee1841a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "39f27253be51551d4ec0bfab1399da00bf85ecce82db3183a46be0e250db6c4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "900c4ed9-c176-4974-b95c-ad772d634425", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "07c9117ae8756d3b4ccc2f6d45cd64817e07729929b04c39fa1156e2de2c07b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  331\nrequires a closer partnership with them. Exclusive distribution is used for new automobiles, some \nmajor appliances, and luxury apparel and accessories. When the legendary Italian designer label Gucci \nfound its image tarnished by overexposure from licensing and discount stores, it decided to end con -\ntracts with third-party suppliers, control its distribution, and open its own stores to bring back some \nof the luster.\nBoth channel partners benefit from exclusive arrangements: The producer obtains more loyal and \ndependable outlets, and the retailer gets a steady supply of special products and stronger seller sup -\nport. Exclusive arrangements are legal as long as they do not substantially lessen competition or tend \nto create a monopoly and as long as both parties enter into them voluntarily.\nExclusive dealing often includes exclusive territorial agreements. The producer may agree not to \nsell to other dealers in a given area, or the buyer may agree to sell only in its own territory. The first \npractice increases dealer enthusiasm and commitment. It is also perfectly legal; a seller has no legal \nobligation to sell through more outlets than it wishes. The second practice, whereby the producer tries \nto keep a dealer from selling outside its territory, has become a major legal issue.\nSelective distribution  relies on some but not all of the intermediaries willing to carry a par -\nticular product. Unlike exclusive distribution, in which individual retailers do not directly compete \nwith one another (for example, because they are assigned non-overlapping geographic areas), selective \ndistribution might include retailers that compete for the same customers. STIHL is a good example of \nsuccessful selective distribution.\nSTIHL  StIhL manufactures handheld outdoor power equipment. All its products are branded \nunder one name, and it does not make private labels for other companies. Best known for its \nchain saws, the company has expanded into string trimmers, blowers, hedge trimmers, and cut-\noff machines. It sells exclusively to six independent U.S. distributors and six company-owned \nmarketing and distribution centers, which sell to a nationwide network of more than 8,000 \nindependent retail dealers offering service. S tIhL also exports to 80 countries and is one of the \nfew outdoor power equipment companies that does not sell through mass merchants, catalogs, \nor the internet.

An increasingly popular way to grow distribution channels is franchising . In a fran -\nchising system, individual franchisees  are a tightly knit group of enterprises whose systematic operations \nare planned, directed, and controlled by the operation\u2019s owner, the franchisor.  Franchise businesses such \nas McDonald\u2019s, Hampton, Jiffy-Lube, Subway, Supercuts, 7-Eleven, and many others are an integral \ncomponent of the business landscape.\nFranchises are distinguished by three main characteristics:\n\u2022 The franchisor owns a trade or service mark and licenses it to franchisees in return for royalty \npayments. For example, McDonald\u2019s Corporation owns the intellectual property associated with \nthe McDonald\u2019s brand and the logistics associated with operating its franchises.\n\u2022 The franchisee pays for the right to be part of the system. Start-up costs include rental and lease \nequipment and fixtures and (usually) a regular license fee. McDonald\u2019s franchisees typically invest \nupward of $1.5 million in total start-up costs and fees. The franchisee then pays McDonald\u2019s a \ncertain percentage of sales plus a monthly rent.\n\u2022 The franchisor provides its franchisees with a system for doing business. McDonald\u2019s requires \nfranchisees to attend \u201cHamburger University\u201d in Oak Brook, Illinois, for two weeks to learn how \nto manage the business. Franchisees must follow certain procedures in buying materials.22\nFranchising benefits both parties. Franchisors gain the motivation and hard work of employ -\nees who are entrepreneurs rather than \u201chired hands,\u201d as well as the franchisees\u2019 familiarity with local \ncommunities and conditions, and the enormous purchasing power of being a franchisor. Franchisees \nbenefit from buying into a business with a proven business model and a well-known and accepted \nbrand name. They find it easier to borrow money for their business from financial institutions, and \nthey receive support in areas ranging from marketing and advertising to site selection and staffing.\nFranchisees do walk a fine line between independence and loyalty to the franchisor. Some fran -\nchisors give their franchisees freedom to run their own operations, from personalizing store names \nto adjusting offerings and price. Great Harvest Bread believes in a \u201cfreedom franchise\u201d approach that \nencourages its franchisee bakers to create new items for their store menus and to share these with other \nfranchisees if they are successful.23\nAlthough franchising is a well-established business practice, it can take different formats depend -\ning on the entity sponsoring the franchise. The manufacturer-sponsored retailer franchise  is the traditional \nsystem. To sell its cars, Ford licenses independent businesspeople who agree to meet specified condi -\ntions of sales and services. Another system is the manufacturer-sponsored wholesaler franchise.

Other firms use customer surveys rather than exams.\nChannel Power.  Producers vary greatly in their skill in managing distributors. Channel power  \nis the ability to alter channel members\u2019 behavior so they take actions they would not have taken oth -\nerwise.25 Manufacturers can draw on the following types of power to elicit cooperation:26\n\u2022 Coercive power.  A manufacturer threatens to withdraw a resource or terminate a relationship if \nintermediaries fail to cooperate. This power can be effective, but its exercise produces resentment \nand can lead intermediaries to organize countervailing power.\n\u2022 Reward power.  The manufacturer offers intermediaries an extra benefit for performing specific \nacts or functions. Reward power typically produces better results than coercive power, but inter -\nmediaries may come to expect a reward every time the manufacturer wants a certain behavior \nto occur.\n\u2022 Legal power.  The manufacturer requests a behavior that is warranted under the contract. As long \nas the intermediaries view the manufacturer as a legitimate leader, legal power works.\n\u2022 Expert power.  The manufacturer has special knowledge that intermediaries value. Once the inter -\nmediaries acquire this expertise, however, expert power weakens. The manufacturer must con -\ntinue to develop new expertise so that intermediaries will want to continue cooperating.\n\u2022 Referent power.  The manufacturer is so highly respected that intermediaries are proud to be associ -\nated with it. Companies such as IBM, Caterpillar, and HP have high referent power.\nThese forms of channel power vary depending on the degree to which they are readily observable. \nCoercive and reward power are objectively observable; legal, expert, and referent power are more sub -\njective and depend on the ability and willingness of parties to recognize them.\nMost producers see gaining intermediaries\u2019 cooperation as a huge challenge. They often use posi -\ntive motivators, such as higher margins, special deals, premiums, cooperative advertising allowances, \ndisplay allowances, and sales contests. At times, they will apply negative sanctions, such as threatening \nto reduce margins, slow down delivery, or terminate the relationship. The weakness of this approach \nis that the producer is using crude, stimulus\u2013response thinking.\nIn many cases, retailers hold the power. One estimate is that manufacturers offer the nation\u2019s \nsupermarkets between 150 and 250 new items each week, of which store buyers reject more than \n70\u00a0percent. Manufacturers need to know the acceptance criteria that buyers, buying committees, and \nstore managers use. Nielsen interviews found that store managers were most influenced by strong \nevidence of consumer acceptance, a well-designed advertising and sales promotion plan, and generous \nfinancial incentives.\nChannel Partnerships.  Based on the nature of the relationship among the members of the \nmarketing channel, there are three basic types of channels: conventional channels, vertical marketing \nsystems, and horizontal marketing systems.\nConventional marketing channels  consist of an independent producer, wholesaler(s), and \nretailer(s). Each is a separate business seeking to maximize its own profits, even if this goal reduces \nprofit for the system as a whole. No channel member has complete or substantial control over other \nmembers. Channel coordination occurs when channel members are brought together to advance the \ngoals of the channel instead of their own potentially incompatible goals.\nVertical marketing systems , by contrast, include the producer, wholesaler(s), and retailer(s) act -\ning as a unified system. One channel member, the channel captain , who is sometimes called a channel \nsteward , owns or franchises the others or has so much power that they all cooperate. Stewards accom -\nplish channel coordination without issuing commands or directives by persuading channel partners \nto act in the best interest of all.27", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4792, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e1d727f-3196-4aff-9622-d3ab62d5e3df": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e1d727f-3196-4aff-9622-d3ab62d5e3df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d578eff2-4a91-439a-8ef3-afb330741276", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "0fc236dabb72a4cafcb3da01e6b008cb34bbe66192e7b9c084f403c543c59b60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c881be2e-3867-4351-85c8-9a4351eab785", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "076aaca81797618db5cfe437118eb3d5b1878d92e50e5cf7864a1ceb697ea5fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f914105-3a87-4419-8adb-fe1156076206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a912bac22b65cc2f2752f366aeeccf947fd3bef01cc17b497148cb66da5e6dd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "334 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nA channel steward might be the maker of the product or service (Procter & Gamble), the \nmaker of a key component (Intel), the supplier or assembler (Arrow Electronics), or the distributor  \n(W.W. Grainger) or retailer (Walmart). Within a company, stewardship might rest with the CEO, a top \nmanager, or a team of senior managers.\nChannel stewardship has two important outcomes. First, it expands value for the steward\u2019s cus -\ntomers, enlarging the market or increasing existing customers\u2019 purchases through the channel. Second, \nit creates a more tightly woven and yet adaptable channel in which valuable members are rewarded \nand the less valuable are weeded out.\nVertical marketing systems arose from strong channel members\u2019 attempts to control channel \nbehavior and eliminate conflict over independent members pursuing their own objectives. These \nsystems achieve economies through size, bargaining power, and elimination of duplicated services. \nBusiness buyers of complex products and systems value the extensive exchange of information they \ncan offer.28 Vertical marketing systems have become the dominant mode of distribution in the U.S. \nconsumer marketplace, serving 70 percent to 80 percent of the market. There are three types: corpo -\nrate, administered, and contractual.\n\u2022 A corporate vertical marketing system  combines successive stages of production and distri -\nbution under single ownership. For years, Sears obtained more than half the goods it sold from \ncompanies it partly or wholly owned. Sherwin-Williams makes paint but also owns and operates \n3,500 retail outlets.\n\u2022 An administered vertical marketing system  coordinates successive stages of production and \ndistribution through the size and power of one of the members. Manufacturers of dominant \nbrands can secure strong trade cooperation and support from resellers. Thus Frito-Lay, Procter &  \nGamble, and Campbell Soup command high levels of cooperation from their resellers in the matter \nof displays, shelf space, promotions, and price policies. The most advanced producer\u2013  distributor \narrangement for administered vertical marketing systems relies on distribution programming, \nwhich builds a planned, professionally managed, vertical marketing system that meets the needs \nof both manufacturer and distributors.\n\u2022 A contractual vertical marketing system  consists of independent firms at different levels of \nproduction and distribution integrating their programs on a contractual basis to obtain more \neconomies or sales impact than they could achieve alone.29 Sometimes thought of as \u201cvalue-\nadding partnerships,\u201d contractual vertical marketing systems come in three types: (1) In wholesaler-\nsponsored voluntary chains , wholesalers organize voluntary chains of independent retailers to help \nstandardize their selling practices and achieve buying economies. (2) In retailer cooperatives , retailers \ntake the initiative and organize a new business entity to carry on wholesaling and possibly some \nproduction. (3) In franchise organizations , a channel member (franchisor) might link several succes -\nsive stages in the production\u2013distribution process.\nMany independent retailers that have not joined a vertical marketing system have developed \nspecialty stores serving special market segments. The result is a polarization in retailing between \nlarge vertical marketing organizations and independent specialty stores, which creates a prob -\nlem for manufacturers. They are strongly tied to independent intermediaries but must eventu -\nally realign themselves with the high-growth vertical marketing systems on less attractive terms. \nFurthermore, vertical marketing systems constantly threaten to bypass large manufacturers and \nset up their own manufacturing. The new competition in retailing is no longer between indepen -\ndent business units but between whole systems of centrally programmed networks (corporate, \nadministered, and contractual) competing against one another to achieve the best cost-economies \nand customer response.\nHorizontal marketing systems  involve two or more unrelated companies putting together \nresources or programs to exploit an emerging marketing opportunity. Each company lacks the \ncapital, know-how, production, or marketing resources to venture alone, or it is afraid of the risk. \nThe companies might work together on a temporary or permanent basis or create a joint venture \ncompany.\nFor example, many supermarket chains have arrangements with local banks to offer in-store \nbanking. Citizens Bank has more than 500 branches in supermarkets, making up a little less than half \nof its branch network. Citizens\u2019 staff members in these locations are more sales oriented and more \nlikely to have some retail sales background than staff in the traditional brick-and-mortar branches.30", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f914105-3a87-4419-8adb-fe1156076206": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f914105-3a87-4419-8adb-fe1156076206", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e22e71c5-c679-45c1-9857-cd013b56f14d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "8bb5e3377ea77e11eee96c1ba08c19e59bef235bbc5a9108ec35ca51fe214b61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e1d727f-3196-4aff-9622-d3ab62d5e3df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "0fc236dabb72a4cafcb3da01e6b008cb34bbe66192e7b9c084f403c543c59b60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20f997b0-c180-4ab8-b9bb-a161e3f62db6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6cf11651ff6b732e75060ddf26eb38f666dedce65d46b38a401f79484214c86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  335\nEVALUATING CHANNEL MEMBERS\nProducers must periodically evaluate intermediaries\u2019 performance against such standards as sales-\nquota attainment, average inventory levels, customer delivery time, treatment of damaged and lost \ngoods, and cooperation in promotional and training programs. A producer will occasionally discover \nit is overpaying particular intermediaries for what they are actually doing. One manufacturer that had \nbeen compensating a distributor for holding inventories found its goods were being held in a public \nwarehouse at its own expense. Producers should set up functional discounts in which they pay speci -\nfied amounts for the trade channel\u2019s performance of each agreed-upon service. Underperformers \nneed to be counseled, retrained, motivated, or terminated.\nA new firm typically starts as a local operation selling in a fairly circumscribed market, using a \nfew existing intermediaries. Identifying the best channels might not be a problem; the problem is often \nto convince the available intermediaries to handle the firm\u2019s line.\nIf the firm is successful, it might branch into new markets with different channels. It might sell \ndirectly to retailers in smaller markets and through distributors in larger markets. It might work with \ngeneral-goods merchants in rural areas and with limited-line merchants in urban areas. It may choose \nto create its own online store to sell directly to customers. It might grant exclusive franchises or sell \nthrough all willing outlets. In one country, the firm might use international sales agents; in another, \nit might partner with a local firm.\nEarly buyers might be willing to pay for high-value-added channels, but later buyers will switch \nto lower cost channels. Small office copiers were sold first by manufacturers\u2019 direct sales forces, later \nthrough office equipment dealers, still later through mass merchandisers, and more recently by mail-\norder firms and internet marketers. In short, the channel system evolves as a function of local oppor -\ntunities and conditions, emerging threats and opportunities, company resources and capabilities, and \nadvancements in technology.\nNo channel strategy remains effective over the whole product life cycle. In competitive markets \nwith low entry barriers, the optimal channel structure will inevitably change over time. New technolo -\ngies have created digital channels undreamed of years ago. The change could mean adding or dropping \nindividual market channels or channel members or developing a totally new way to sell goods. When \nnew competition from Best Buy and Costco forced one-third of Leica\u2019s U.S. dealers to close, the high-\nend camera maker decided to open its own stylish stores to appeal to serious photographers.31\nA producer must periodically review and modify its channel design and arrangements.32 The \ndistribution channel may not work as planned, consumer buying patterns change, the market expands, \nnew competition arises, innovative distribution channels emerge, and the product moves into later \nstages in the product life cycle.33\nTo add or drop individual channel members, the company needs to make an incremental analysis. \nA basic question is \u201cWhat would the firm\u2019s sales and profits look like with and without this interme -\ndiary?\u201d Perhaps the most difficult decision is whether to revise the overall channel strategy. Avon\u2019s \ndoor-to-door system for selling cosmetics was modified as more women left the house and entered \nthe paid workforce.\nChannel Cooperation and Conflict\nNo matter how well channels are designed and managed, there will be some conflict, if only because \nthe interests of independent business entities do not always coincide. Channel conflict  occurs when \none channel member\u2019s actions prevent another channel member from achieving its goal. Companies \ndistributing their offerings through different channels are likely to face a certain level of channel \nconflict. In this context, a manager\u2019s goal is to reduce the channel conflict by minimizing the frictions \nbetween channel members.\nA common source of channel conflict is a manufacturer\u2019s desire to sell directly to its customers, \nbypassing its traditional channel partners. By opening its own retail stores, Apple created a challenge \nfor many of its authorized solution-provider and channel partners by effectively \u201cstealing\u201d many of \ntheir current customers. Likewise, in the business-to-business space, Apple has stepped up its direct \nsales force in enterprise accounts, including forming direct partnerships with companies such as Cisco \nand IBM that have effectively limited the scope of services provided by many of their independent \nsolution providers.34", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4763, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20f997b0-c180-4ab8-b9bb-a161e3f62db6": {"__data__": {"id_": "20f997b0-c180-4ab8-b9bb-a161e3f62db6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df35cdc6-e323-4b95-b1e7-671f3d337228", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "7322a48a06425f9fcd1fe0bf80a6c98a297857e4b388dc5ee030ef6bd6651df6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f914105-3a87-4419-8adb-fe1156076206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "5b9b77e7da3d980ead761a177e1d0eb30cacb27b79200ab7eee9680856357fb0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14d505bd-5f4c-4bfe-888a-4984fa265722", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a00c824b31cd30c097447e3411551af544ae7f3a0dd6117e34d1d9139e149c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "336 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nHere we examine three questions: What types of conflict arise in channels? What causes conflict? \nWhat can channel members do to resolve it?\nTHE NATURE OF CHANNEL CONFLICTS\nTo be able to effectively manage channel conflict, managers must understand the key types of channel \nconflict and the factors that often lead to conflicts among channel partners.\nTypes of Channel Conflict.  Suppose a manufacturer sets up a vertical channel consisting of \nwholesalers and retailers, hoping for channel cooperation and greater profits for each member. Despite \na desire by all parties to cooperate, horizontal, vertical, and multichannel conflict can occur.\n\u2022 Horizontal channel conflict  occurs between channel members at the same level. For example, \nfranchisees might provide poor customer service, which harms brand value and results in poor \nconsumer reviews that damage sales across all other channels. For example, some Pizza Inn fran -\nchisees complained about other franchisees cheating on ingredients, providing poor service, and \nhurting the overall brand image.\n\u2022 Vertical channel conflict  occurs between different levels of the channel. For example, a verti -\ncal conflict is likely to occur when a manufacturer sells to wholesalers and retailers directly. It \nis likely to be especially intense when the manufacturer sells directly to one of a wholesaler\u2019s \nlargest customers. For example, when Est\u00e9e Lauder set up an online store to sell its Clinique and \nBobbi Brown brands, some department stores reduced the space it allotted to the company\u2019s \nproducts.\n\u2022 Multichannel conflict  exists when the manufacturer has established two or more channels \nthat sell to the same market. For example, multichannel conflict is likely to occur when a res -\ntaurant chain allows two franchise locations within close proximity to each other. Multichannel \nconflict can be especially intense when the members of one channel get a lower price (based on \nlarger-volume purchases) or work with a lower margin. When Goodyear began selling its popu -\nlar tire brands through Sears, Walmart, and Discount Tire, it angered its independent  dealers. \nGoodyear eventually placated them by offering exclusive tire models not sold in other\u00a0retail \noutlets.35\nCauses of Channel Conflict.  Even though each channel conflict has unique antecedents and \nconsequences, there are several general factors that can contribute to the creation of a channel conflict. \nSome of the most common reasons for channel conflict are as follows:\n\u2022 Goal incompatibility.  Channel conflict can stem from the conflicting goals of different channel \nmembers. For example, a manufacturer may want to achieve rapid market penetration through \na low-price policy. Dealers, in contrast, may prefer to work with high margins and pursue short-\nrun profitability.\n\u2022 Differences in strategies and tactics.  Channel conflict may also occur when channel members adopt \ndifferent strategies and tactics to achieve their goals. The manufacturer may be optimistic about \nthe short-term economic outlook and want dealers to carry higher inventory, while the dealers \nmay be pessimistic. In the beverage category, it is not uncommon for disputes to arise between \nmanufacturers and their distributors about the optimal advertising strategy.\n\u2022 Power imbalance.  Greater retailer consolidation\u2014the 10 largest U.S. retailers account for more \nthan 80 percent of the average manufacturer\u2019s business\u2014has led to increased retailer influ -\nence that often spawns channel conflict. Walmart, for example, is the principal buyer for the \nproducts of many manufacturers, including Disney, Procter & Gamble, and Revlon, and is able \nto command reduced prices or quantity discounts from these and other suppliers.36 Power \nimbalance can also be caused by distributors\u2019 reliance on the manufacturer. The fortunes of \nexclusive dealers, such as auto dealers, are profoundly affected by the manufacturer\u2019s product \nand pricing decisions.\n\u2022 Unclear roles and rights.  Territory boundaries and credit for sales often produce conflict. HP may sell \nlaptops to large accounts through its own sales force, but its licensed dealers may also be trying \nto sell to large accounts.37", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4234, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14d505bd-5f4c-4bfe-888a-4984fa265722": {"__data__": {"id_": "14d505bd-5f4c-4bfe-888a-4984fa265722", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb780275-0556-40f1-b5b7-2eb191491598", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "12867b110951f35afd1199246af0572a0e609d3d0807e7c33406bf12804a4516", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20f997b0-c180-4ab8-b9bb-a161e3f62db6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "7322a48a06425f9fcd1fe0bf80a6c98a297857e4b388dc5ee030ef6bd6651df6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c40c9d3-31d5-45d4-abca-adfe96e8cd87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2da9ad61bbf11fd03562392e56a219cbbe4e6a811b5ec8f9dbe3b9341e081a04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  337\nMANAGING CHANNEL CONFLICT\nSome channel conflict can be constructive and lead to better adaptation to a changing environment, \nbut too much is dysfunctional.38 The challenge is not to eliminate all conflict, which is impossible, \nbut to manage it better. Reprimands, fines, withheld bonuses, and other remedies can help mini -\nmize channel conflict.39 Common mechanisms for effective conflict management include strategic \njustification, dual compensation, superordinate goals, employee exchange, joint memberships, and \nco-optation, as well as diplomacy, mediation, or arbitration and legal recourse.40\n\u2022 Strategic justification.  In some cases, a convincing strategic justification that channel members \nserve distinctive segments and do not compete as much as they might think can reduce potential \nfor conflict. Developing special versions of products for different channel members\u2014branded \n variants\u2014is a clear way to demonstrate that distinctiveness.41\n\u2022 Dual compensation.  A company can mitigate channel conflict by paying existing channel members \nfor sales made through new channels. When Allstate started selling insurance online, it agreed \nto pay agents a 2 percent commission for face-to-face service to customers who got their quotes \nonline. Although lower than the agents\u2019 typical 10 percent commission for offline transactions, \nthis commission did reduce tensions.42\n\u2022 Superordinate goals.  Channel members can come to an agreement on the fundamental or super -\nordinate goal they are jointly seeking, whether it is survival, market share, high quality, or \ncustomer satisfaction. They usually do this best when the channel faces an outside threat, such \nas a more efficient competing channel, an adverse piece of legislation, or a shift in consumer \ndesires.\n\u2022 Employee exchange.  Exchanging personnel between two or more channel levels can reduce channel \nconflict. GM\u2019s executives might agree to work for a short time in some dealerships, and some \ndealership owners might work in GM\u2019s dealer policy department. Thus, participants can grow to \nappreciate each other\u2019s point of view.\n\u2022 Joint memberships.  Marketers can encourage joint memberships in trade associations. Good coop -\neration between the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the Food Marketing Institute, which \nrepresents most of the food chains, led to the development of the universal product code (UPC). \nThe associations can consider issues between food manufacturers and retailers and resolve them \nin an orderly way.\n\u2022 Co-optation.  An organization can win the support of its channel members by including its leaders \nin advisory councils, boards of directors, and the like. If the organization treats invited leaders \nseriously and listens to their opinions, co-optation can reduce conflict, although the initiator may \nneed to compromise its policies and plans to win outsiders\u2019 support.\n\u2022 Diplomacy, mediation, and arbitration.  When conflict is chronic or acute, the parties may need to \nresort to stronger means. Diplomacy takes place when each side sends a person or group to meet \nwith its counterpart to resolve the conflict. Mediation relies on a neutral third party skilled in \nconciliating the two parties\u2019 interests. In arbitration, two parties agree to present their arguments \nto one or more arbitrators and accept their decision.\n\u2022 Legal recourse.  Rather than pursuing other strategies, a channel partner may choose to rely on legal \nmeans to resolve the conflict.43 When Coca-Cola decided to distribute Powerade thirst quencher \ndirectly to Walmart\u2019s regional warehouses, 60 bottlers complained that the practice would under -\nmine their core direct-store-distribution duties and filed suit.

Supply chain management  starts before physical distribution and includes strategically \nprocuring the right inputs (raw materials, components, and capital equipment), converting them \nefficiently into finished products, and dispatching them to the final destinations. An even broader \nperspective looks at how the company\u2019s suppliers themselves obtain their inputs.\nThe supply chain perspective can help a company identify superior suppliers and distributors \nand then help it improve productivity and reduce costs. Firms with top supply chains include Apple, \nMcDonald\u2019s, Amazon.com, Unilever, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Toyota, Cisco Systems, and Samsung \nElectronics.45 Some companies choose to partner with and outsource to third-party logistics special -\nists for help with transportation planning, distribution center management, and other valued-added \nservices that go beyond shipping and storing.\nStudying market logistics leads managers to find the most efficient way to deliver value. For exam -\nple, a software company traditionally produced and packaged software disks and manuals, shipped \nthem to wholesalers, which shipped them to retailers, which sold them to customers, who brought \nthem home to install the software on their computers. Market logistics offered two superior delivery \nsystems. The first let customers download the software directly onto their computers. The second \nallowed the computer manufacturer to download the software onto its products. Both solutions elimi -\nnated the need for printing, packaging, shipping, and stocking millions of disks and manuals and have \nquickly become the norm of the industries.\nMARKET -LOGISTICS OBJECTIVES\nMany companies state their market-logistics objective as \u201cgetting the right goods to the right places \nat the right time for the least cost.\u201d Unfortunately, this objective provides little practical guidance. No \nsystem can simultaneously maximize customer service and minimize distribution cost. Maximum \ncustomer service implies large inventories, premium transportation, and multiple warehouses, all of \nwhich raise market-logistics costs. Nor can a company achieve efficient market logistics by asking \neach market-logistics manager to minimize his or her own logistics costs.\nMinimizing market-logistics costs can influence the overall market success of an offering and, in \nsome cases, can even be counterproductive. Consider these examples:\nThe traffic manager favors rail shipment over air shipment because rail costs less. However, \nbecause the railroads are slower, rail shipment ties up working capital longer, delays customer \npayment, and might send customers to competitors that offer faster service.\nThe shipping department uses cheap containers to minimize shipping costs. Cheaper \n containers lead to a higher rate of damaged goods and customer ill will.\nThe inventory manager favors low inventories. This increases stock-outs, back orders, \n paperwork, special production runs, and high-cost, fast-freight shipments.\nGiven these trade-offs, managers must make decisions on a total-system basis. The starting point \nis to study what customers require and what competitors are offering. Customers are interested in  \non-time delivery, help meeting emergency needs, careful handling of merchandise, and quick return \nand replacement of defective goods.\nThe wholesaler must then research the relative importance of these service outputs. For example, \nservice-repair time is very important to buyers of copying equipment. Xerox developed a service deliv -\nery standard that \u201ccan put a disabled machine anywhere in the continental United States back into \noperation within three hours after receiving the service request.\u201d It then designed a service division of \ntechnicians, parts, and locations to deliver on this promise.\nThe company must also consider competitors\u2019 service standards. It will normally want to match \nor exceed these, but the objective is to maximize profits, not sales. Some companies offer less service \nand charge a lower price; other companies offer more service and charge a premium price.\nThe company ultimately must establish some promise it makes to the market. Some compa -\nnies define standards for each service factor. One appliance manufacturer promises to deliver at least \n95\u00a0 percent of the dealer\u2019s orders within seven days of order receipt, to fill them with 99 percent accu -\nracy, to deal with inquiries about order status within three hours, and to ensure that merchandise \ndamaged in transit does not exceed 1 percent.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4680, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "983f5a9b-bfd2-4fe9-a60f-511d07039173": {"__data__": {"id_": "983f5a9b-bfd2-4fe9-a60f-511d07039173", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffaaabe3-9c9b-484c-9513-416d52cc4bef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "cdccf5d55743c0186afbdba4ec1673d4c8cb862b77b150699c3b22781936001f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c40c9d3-31d5-45d4-abca-adfe96e8cd87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "8bf3bbac2fd04d44c062d12215cec9f417e85c1f3e6f01e290e30b4f9b73beaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c05ce5f7-9465-4ef5-9ba2-a2e39e299976", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4001fc9bb519aa4d167536179fca3cb87e9a0246284df0fed75a157074c877b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 15    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  DIStRIBU tIoN ChANNELS  339\nMARKET -LOGISTICS DECISIONS\nThe firm must make four major decisions about its market logistics: How should we handle orders \n(order processing)? Where should we locate our stock (warehousing)? How much stock should we \nhold (inventory)? and How should we ship goods (transportation)?\nOrder Processing.  Most companies are trying to shorten the order-to-payment cycle \u2014that is, \nthe time between an order\u2019s receipt, delivery, and payment. This cycle has many steps, including order \ntransmission by the salesperson, order entry and customer credit check, inventory and production \nscheduling, order and invoice shipment, and receipt of payment. The longer this cycle takes, the lower \nthe customer\u2019s satisfaction and the lower the company\u2019s profits.\nWarehousing.  Most companies must store finished goods until they are sold because production \nand consumption cycles rarely match. In order to make use of existing resources and speed transporta -\ntion times, some companies have decentralized their inventory. For example, to better manage inven -\ntory, many department stores (such as Nordstrom and Macy\u2019s) now ship online orders from individual \nstores. More stocking locations mean that goods can be delivered to customers more quickly, but \nwarehousing and inventory costs are higher. Alternatively, to reduce costs, a company might centralize \nits inventory in one place and use fast transportation to fill orders.\nSome warehouses are now taking on activities formerly done in the plant, including product \nassembly, packaging, and construction of promotional displays. Moving these activities to the ware -\nhouse can save costs and match the offerings more closely to demand.\nInventory.  Salespeople would like their companies to carry enough stock to fill all customer orders \nimmediately. However, this is not cost effective. Inventory cost increases at an accelerating rate as the \ndesired level of customer satisfaction approaches 100 percent. Management needs to know how much \nsales and profits would increase as a result of carrying larger inventories and promising faster order \nfulfillment times and then make a decision.\nAs inventory draws down, management must know at what stock level to place a new order. This \nstock level is called the order ( or reorder) point.  An order point of 20 means reordering when the stock \nfalls to 20 units. The order point should balance the risks of stock-out, where the company runs out \nof a particular good and is unable to meet customer demand, against the costs of overstock, where the \ncompany has to bear the cost of carrying an inventory for a long period of time. The other decision is \nhow much to order. The larger the quantity ordered, the less frequently an order needs to be placed.\nThe company needs to balance order-processing costs and inventory-carrying costs. Order-  \nprocessing costs  for a manufacturer consist of setup costs  (costs of setting up the processes required to \nproduce one item) and running costs  (operating costs when production is running) for the item. If setup \ncosts are low, the manufacturer can produce the item often, and the average cost per item is stable and \nequal to the running costs. If setup costs are high, however, the manufacturer can reduce the average \ncost per unit by producing a long run and carrying more inventory.\nOrder-processing costs must be compared with inventory-carrying costs,  which include storage \ncharges, cost of capital, taxes and insurance, and depreciation and obsolescence. Carrying costs might \nrun as high as 30 percent of inventory value and are higher the larger the average stock carried. This \nmeans marketing managers who want to carry larger inventories need to show that incremental gross \nprofits will exceed incremental carrying costs.\nCompanies are using different strategies to manage their inventory costs. One approach involves \nkeeping slow-moving inventory items in a central location and carrying fast-moving items in ware -\nhouses closer to customers. Alternatively, a company can switch to carrying near-zero inventory and \nacquiring stock based on orders. In addition to saving on warehousing costs, this approach\u2014referred \nto as just-in-time inventory management \u2014helps the company improve its cash flow. Thus, by ask -\ning consumers to pay for the purchased items in advance, a company can use customers\u2019 money to pay \nsuppliers to ship the product or the necessary components.\nDespite its obvious cost advantages, the just-in-time inventory management approach has an \nimportant drawback in that it assumes uninterrupted distribution logistics. Simply put, just-in-time \ninventory does not have sufficient flexibility should anything go wrong, as it often does\u2014whether \nit\u2019s a dock strike in California, an earthquake in Japan, or political turmoil in North Africa and the", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4901, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c05ce5f7-9465-4ef5-9ba2-a2e39e299976": {"__data__": {"id_": "c05ce5f7-9465-4ef5-9ba2-a2e39e299976", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e980ed71-55ca-4d59-9575-7e73b481cb9c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "d8e840ef8a55905b74687efffc8bf6240b0a6acf504eca28a396c804c0420c7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "983f5a9b-bfd2-4fe9-a60f-511d07039173", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap15.pdf"}, "hash": "27431b170f9c4348361ea27e6c3762a2fd7620820ea05ea3de6dee36aa5b6e90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4bd413c-317a-46d9-b7aa-0cc36a690c51", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "218144e13ba98c20597ec5f7204a86d473a07458b5ac459bef372de2448f2f1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "340 PART  6   |  DELIVERING VALUE\nMiddle East. In an interconnected world, one weak link, if not properly managed, can bring down the \nentire supply chain. The limitations of just-in-time inventory management came prominently into \nfocus during the coronavirus pandemic, as disruptions in procurement, manufacturing, and shipping \nresulted in demand outstripping supply in many categories, culminating in product shortages and \nlonger delivery times than usual.\nTo balance the effectiveness and the cost-efficiency of their logistics, companies need to  re- evaluate \ntheir logistics networks periodically to guard against extreme demand shocks.  Accordingly, many \ncompanies are securing additional warehousing space and modernizing their distribution  operations. \nMerchants are also moving their warehouses closer to large population centers to ensure not only that \nthey have the required inventory on hand but also that they are able to deliver it to their customers \nfaster than the competition.\nTransportation.  Transportation choices affect product pricing, on-time delivery performance, and \nthe condition of the goods when they arrive, all of which affect customer satisfaction.\nIn shipping goods to its warehouses, dealers, and customers, a company can choose rail, air, truck, \nwaterway, or pipeline. Shippers consider such criteria as speed, frequency, dependability, capability, \navailability, traceability, and cost. For speed, the prime contenders are air, rail, and truck. If the goal is \nlow cost, then the choice is water or pipeline.\nShippers are increasingly combining two or more transportation modes, thanks to container -\nization. Containerization  consists of putting the goods in boxes or trailers that are easy to transfer \nbetween two transportation modes. The term piggyback  describes the use of rail and trucks; fishyback,  \nwater and trucks; trainship,  water and rail; and airtruck,  air and trucks. Each coordinated mode offers \nspecific advantages. For example, piggyback is cheaper than trucking alone but provides flexibility \nand convenience.\nShippers can choose private, contract, or common carriers. If the shipper owns its own truck or \nair fleet, it becomes a private carrier.  A contract carrier  is an independent organization selling transporta -\ntion services to others on a contract basis. A common carrier  provides services between predetermined \npoints on a scheduled basis and is available to all shippers at standard rates. Some contract carriers are \ninvesting and innovating to create strong value propositions.\nContract Carriers  With so many transportation options available, shipping firms \nare constantly competing to cut costs, improve services, and offer even more value to their \ncustomers. Copenhagen-based Maersk Group is the world\u2019s largest global shipper, with around \n550 container ships and 225 tankers. to improve efficiency, the firm commissioned 20 of the \nlargest ships ever built. Costing $185 million each, these giant ships can cost effectively carry \n18,000 containers, emitting 50 percent less C o2 in the process. Schneider, one of the country\u2019s \nlargest full-truckload freight haulers with more than $3 billion in revenue, developed a fleet-wide \n\u201ctactical simulator\u201d that has saved the company tens of millions of dollars. Besides helping in \nthe crucial day-to-day route scheduling of drivers, the simulator has also helped with specific \ndecisions ranging from when to raise prices for certain customers to how many drivers to hire \n(and where). Little changes can make big differences for shippers. Global logistics leader UPS \ncalculated that by having its drivers use a fob instead of a key to operate its trucks, it is cutting \nout on average 1.7 seconds per stop, or 6.5 minutes per day, saving an estimated $70 million a \nyear in the process.46\nTo reduce costly handing at arrival, some firms are putting items into shelf-ready packaging so \nthey don\u2019t have to unpack them from a box and place them individually on a shelf. In Europe, Procter &  \nGamble has used a three-tier logistics system to schedule deliveries of fast- and slow-moving goods, \nbulky items, and small items in the most efficient way. To reduce damage in shipping, the size, weight, \nand fragility of the item must be reflected in the crating technique used and the density of foam cush -\nioning.

An increasingly popular form of growing distribution \nchannels is franchising. In a franchising system, indi -\nvidual franchisees are a tightly knit group of enterprises \nwhose systematic operations are planned, directed, and \ncontrolled by the operation\u2019s innovator, the franchi -\nsor. Franchisees benefit from buying into a business \nwith a well-known and accepted brand name. They \nfind it easier to borrow money for their business from \nfinancial institutions, and they receive support in areas \nranging from marketing and advertising to site selection \nand\u00a0staffing.\n8. A company needs to motivate its channel partners by \nidentifying their needs and wants and tailor its chan -\nnel offering to provide them with superior value. An \nimportant factor here is channel power, which reflects \nthe ability to alter channel members\u2019 behavior so they \ntake actions they would not have taken otherwise. Based \non the nature of the relationship between the members \nof the marketing channel, there are three basic forms of \nchannel coordination that can help motivate channel \npartners: conventional channels, vertical marketing sys -\ntems, and horizontal marketing systems.\n9. All marketing channels have the potential for conflict \nand competition resulting from goal incompatibility, \npoorly defined roles and rights, perceptual differences, \nand interdependent relationships. Companies can try to \nmanage conflict through dual compensation, superordi -\nnate goals, employee exchange, co-optation, and other \nmeans.\n10.

The supply-chain approach to managing market logis -\ntics can help a company identify superior suppliers and \ndistributors, as well as help it improve productivity \nand reduce costs. The firm must make four major deci -\nsions about its market logistics: How should we handle \norders (order processing)? Where should we locate \nour stock (warehousing)? How much stock should \nwe hold (inventory)? and How should we ship goods \n(transportation)?summary\n1. Most producers do not sell their goods directly to final \nusers. Between producers and final users stands one \nor more marketing channels, with a host of market -\ning intermediaries performing a variety of functions. \n Distribution channels are sets of interdependent organi -\nzations participating in the process of making a product \nor service available for use or consumption.\n2. Companies use intermediaries when they lack the \nfinancial resources to carry out direct marketing, when \ndirect marketing is not feasible, and when they can earn \nmore by doing so. Effective channel management calls \nfor selecting intermediaries and training and motivating \nthem. The goal is to build a long-term partnership that \nwill be profitable for all channel members.\n3. Members of the marketing channel perform a number \nof key functions. Some of these functions (storage and \nmovement, title, and communications) constitute a for-\nward flow  of activity from the company to the customer; \nothers (ordering and payment) constitute a backward flow  \nfrom customers to the company; and some (informa -\ntion, negotiation, finance, and risk taking) occur in both \ndirections.\n4. Manufacturers have many alternatives for reaching a \nmarket. They can sell direct or use one-, two-, or multi-\nlevel channels.

Zara\u2019s business model of imitating the latest fashion \nand providing their designs at low prices appealed to  Spanish \nconsumers. In the next eight years, Zara expanded to nine \nmore stores in popular shopping centers in Spain. During \nthis period, ortega had created a design, manufacturing, and \ndistribution process he called \u201cinstant fashion,\u201d which could \nrespond to fashion trends very quickly. Using this process, \nZara spent the next decade expanding into the global mar -\nket, which included the United States, France, Belgium, and \n Sweden. After achieving similar success with its expansions, \nZara eventually became the world\u2019s largest apparel retailer.\nZara famously views clothes as a \u201cperishable commod-\nity,\u201d something that should be enjoyed for a couple of weeks \nor months. Zara\u2019s apparel appeals to consumers who are \nlooking to keep up with all the latest fashion trends. When a \nnew style becomes popular, Zara can imitate it and release a \nnew collection in less than two weeks. other fashion compa-\nnies can take as long as six months to put out a new design. \nUnlike companies that focus on quantity over style, Zara \ndoes the opposite. Zara releases over 12,000 styles per year; \nthis wide variety creates a greater likelihood that consumers \nwill find an item they like.\nthe majority of Zara\u2019s designs stay on shelves for only \nthree to four weeks. the constant refreshing of styles on \nstore shelves also incentivizes customers to visit Zara stores \nmore frequently. this can be seen in consumer behavior \nin Central London. Consumers visit other clothing stores \nand average of up to four times per year. Zara\u2019s customers \nvisit shops an average of 17 times per year. the full racks \nof clothes always give shoppers something new to choose \nfrom. Zara produces lower quantities of each style to create \nartificial scarcity, which makes their offerings seem more \ndesirable and luxurious. An added benefit of this scarcity is \nthat if a style is not successful, Zara doesn\u2019t have to dispose \nof a high volume of inventory.\nZara\u2019s clothing starts with the design process, which \nincludes a heavy focus on consumer input. Store employees \nand managers listen to customers\u2019 comments and sugges-\ntions and take note of what they\u2019re wearing in stores. Design \nteams visit universities, nightclubs, shopping centers, and \nother areas frequented by fashion trendsetters to observe \nnew fashion choices that could potentially be successful. \nthe trends team follows popular fashion bloggers and tracks \nZara customers for new insights. the data gathered by Zara\u2019s \nresearch team span new trends that differ by gender, culture, \nand season. this allows Zara to create product offerings that \nreflect the different needs of the global market. Zara offers \nsmaller-sized clothing in Japan, hijab headscarves and long \ndresses for women in Arab countries, and more breathable \napparel for countries in South America. Understanding the \nvaried needs of its customers allows Zara to release a wide \nvariety of successful styles on a frequent basis.\nWhat enables Zara to release new collections quickly is \nits fast and vertically integrated supply chain. Zara\u2019s in-house \nproduction facilities allow the company to control processes \nsuch as dyeing, fabric cutting, and processing. When new \ndesigns come into the factory, clothing items are manufac-\ntured, processed, and in stores within 15 days. Zara tends \nto manufacture only fashionable and trendy items that have \na short selling cycle. Items that tend to stay on shelves, like \nbasic t-shirts and pants, are outsourced to low-cost suppli-\ners in Asia. When items are released and fail to meet sales \nexpectations, factories quickly cancel production. Zara\u2019s fast \nand efficient flow of information and data can result in large \nfluctuations in orders. Zara can adjust orders up to 40 to \n50\u00a0percent, avoiding potential overproduction.
