Lawson\nDepartment of Marketing, University of Otago, P.O. Box 561, Dunedin, New Zealand\nThis paper reviews the concept of the family life cycle in light of demographic patterns\nand social trends in the United Kingdom and assesses the usefulness and limitations of\nthree different structures from US literature for marketing management on this side of\nthe Atlantic. It is the first attempt to relate some of the classifications used in the\nbusiness literature to British demographic statistics. Trends in marriage, birth, divorce,\ndeath and female employment are examined to show how the structure of the family life\ncycle is altering. The implications of these changes for using the family life cycle in\nconsumer research and market segementation analysis are considered and a revised family\nlife cycle structure is proposed which increases coverage of the UK population to over\n80% of households compared to the average 70% coverage offered by the other schemes.\nINTRODUCTION\nJust as Murphy and Staples (1979) say that the family has been one of the\ngreat hallmarks of American society it can also be claimed to be central to\nthe way of life in the UK. In the areas of consumer behaviour research and\nmarketing management one of the most established concepts that has been\ndeveloped is the family life cycle. The family life cycle (f.l.c.) is one of the\nsocial stratification techniques commonly used for analysing data and has\nparticularly important contributions to make in market segmentation\n(Dominguez and Page 1981). The objective of this paper is to review the\nconcept in light of UK demographic patterns so that the marketing\nmanager and researcher may have a greater practical understanding of the\ntopic and the trends which affect it.\nThe concept originated in the sociology literature at the turn of the\ncentury and has been used in consumer analyses since the 1950s to examine\nboth general patterns of consumption and demand for specific products.\nAlso it has been related to the actual decision making processes which\nfamilies use when purchasing. In order to illustrate the relevance of the\nconcept for marketing management it is easiest to look at the scheme\ndevised by Wells and Gubar in 1966 which divided the history of the family\ninto nine possible stages. Despite the fact that this work is twenty years old,\nit is still probably the most widely referred to f.l.c. structure in the\nmarketing literature and the general consumption characteristics associated\n13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2589, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99678ac9-6e1f-48c8-8e57-2ef142be1837": {"__data__": {"id_": "99678ac9-6e1f-48c8-8e57-2ef142be1837", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa31f18-15b8-4b28-a0c6-84111996ffd3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "2239bbca53d27d488565a21e8784f6763be733889a0bd24e22c28b98ba8d6a75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "07cd20e6-7055-45b7-a35f-b5fe684b75fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "9d71c8690501a5f1ecd1da6e8aa8bffd91233d79897c1917876feed639ad1df6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fcb226b-d107-4c5b-aa29-c93dcf84adc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e034ec92111136b5ec4ae2b39b9f00bc0097f91a965bebbc0078567995cea42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "14 ROB W. LAWSON\nwith the life cycle still seem to remain valid. Table 1 gives a summary of\nthe most important features of their review of buyer behaviour over the life\ncycle. It shows how the family life cycle is a multidimensional construct\nwhich takes into account age, the presence of children and income. Thus it\nreflects many of the basic needs and constraints that influence the purchas-\ning patterns of a family over its history. With regard to income it is implicit\nin concept that absolute levels of income will rise over the life cycle until\nretirement. However the differences between the stages are especially\nimportant in describing that amount of income which is likely to be\nuncommited after meeting the basic needs of the family and is therefore\navailable for expenditure on more discretionary items. Besides particular\nrelationships which can be identified with certain family stages (e.g. baby\nproducts and the Full Nest 1 stage), the review of the academic literature\non the f.l.c. shows how many of the more positive relationships between the\nf.l.c. and consumption patterns have been found in product and service\nareas such as tourism and recreation.

Several authors\nhave noted how the structure of the concept must be continually revised to\ntake account of changing demographic and social trends in marriage,\ndivorce, births, deaths, and the employment status of women (Feldman and\nFeldman 1975, Norton 1983, Parke and Glicke 1967, Spanner el al. 1979).\nMurphy and Staples carried out this exercise for the United States using\n1971 census data but there has been no comparable evaluation in the UK.\nThe closest approximation to this would seem to be that by Research\nServices Ltd who use a simplified life cycle structure as the basis for their\nSagacity groupings (Research Services Ltd 1987). They define the life cycle\ninto four broad stages (Dependent, Pre-Family, Family and Late) and then\nrefine some of these stages by income and occupation to produce twelve\ngroups each covering between 4% and 20% of the population.\nAn additional problem in terms of this country is that, because of the\ncomparative dearth of research on consumer behaviour in Britain, all the\ndifferent f.l.c. schemes in current use in the consumer behaviour literature\nhave been proposed by American authors with American demography in\nmind. It is the aim of this paper to review the concept of the f.l.c. in light of\ndemographic patterns and social trends in the United Kingdom; and\nthereby assess the usefulness and limitations of some of the several structures\nfor consumer research and marketing management on this side of the\nAtlantic.

A brief look at Rowntree's work shows how he related income and\nneeds in the family to produce a life cycle reflecting alternative periods of\n\"want\" and \"plenty\", see Figure 1.\nThus in Rowntree's definition a life cycle starts at 0 and includes\nchildhood and is defined around a series of critical points such as marriage,\nbirth of children and retirement. The notion of critical points and resulting\nchanges in behaviour is the central aspect to the concept and is supported\nby other work as well as direct studies on the life cycle (Andreasen 1984).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2951, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1953ce2-2676-4c6d-bb56-29a9c671287b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1953ce2-2676-4c6d-bb56-29a9c671287b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "671fa0a6-f1e3-4a8d-b701-45009fa5a8a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "459a620026f83d0261d6057aebd2c4e67a3bd4517cd681677579e89265ffc7c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fcb226b-d107-4c5b-aa29-c93dcf84adc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "a45185b83a21909fd636bc5fb310f34b34b6d30290d8d7b9246d5a5ce8ef6a97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ca2fbb3-feb3-49d5-b491-fdd86b411bde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9016365be8d052ca1bbf3a541fc97165e80bcb330b2e68a1ffcffbe90ea7d1ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "16 ROB W.

Starting\nthe life cycle as the child leaves home or sets up their own family of\nprocreation does have the advantage of not resulting in double counting of\nindividuals in cross-sectional studies, but other authors (Stampfl 1978) have\nargued in support of Rowntree about the importance of including childhood\nwhen studying individuals over time. The correct starting place really\ndepends upon the use to which the concept is being put. In a segmentation\nanalysis, which involves the classification of individuals across a market,\ngenerally it would not be correct to include childhood. But if a researcher\nwas seeking to explain the development of purchasing patterns within a\nfamily over time then the inclusion of the childhood phase with its\nimportant socialisation aspects becomes critical.\nThough the roots of the concept are firmly embedded in sociological\ntheory it is important to realise that related work has come from other\ndisciplines, especially economics. Many notable economists, including Pigou,\nKeynes and Friedman, have produced ideas about how consumers may\nadapt to these peaks and troughs of plenty and want through the Absolute\nIncome, Permanent Income and Relative Income hypotheses. More recently\nother work by Ghez and Becker (1975) provides some of the most important\nempirical analysis of how consumption and earnings are related to the life\ncycle.\nAs indicated above, in the management orientated consumer behaviour\nliterature attention has focussed on the f.l.c. for two reasons. Firstly, the\nneeds of individuals and families can be seen to change over the life cycle\nand therefore patterns of consumption will change. Secondly, it has been\nshown that patterns of decision making within families also change over the\nf.l.c.\nEfforts to correlate actual patterns of purchasing and consumption to the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ca2fbb3-feb3-49d5-b491-fdd86b411bde": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ca2fbb3-feb3-49d5-b491-fdd86b411bde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25a3eb66-fee4-4a7f-ba10-8329ffc02a1a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "7d88172f49d13b8e99fb5caf5bda770ae10e802409f15c865ce28d81410a6ebf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1953ce2-2676-4c6d-bb56-29a9c671287b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "459a620026f83d0261d6057aebd2c4e67a3bd4517cd681677579e89265ffc7c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbb120de-a330-497c-97b8-420656159b61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "464cb7421957950193b0f40a35a3510ce2bca49039225d4f599e7caaed9df16e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE FAMILY LIFE CYCLE: A DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS 17\nf.l.c. started about thirty years ago with the work of Barton (1955), Lansing\nand Morgan (1955) and Lansing and Kish (1952). Since those early\nattempts to correlate consumer behaviour and the life cycle many more\nstudies have conducted ranging from fairly general evaluations of consump-\ntion patterns (Bellante and Foster 1984, Derrick and Lehfeld 1980, Reynolds\nand Wells 1977, Wagner and Hanna 1983, Wells and Gubar 1966, Wortzel\n1977) to attempts to identify more exact relationships with specific products\nsuch as housing (McLeod and Ellis 1982), fuel consumption (Fritzche 1981,\nTaschian 1983), and telephone usage (Ellis 1975). A limited number of\nspecific topics have attracted more attention over the years so that several\ninvestigations can be found relating the f.l.c. to shopping patterns (Bellenge\nel al. 1977, Darden and Perreault 1976, Rich and Jain 1968), financial\nservices (Dominguez and Page 1984, Fitts and Mason 1977, Jain 1975), arid\nleisure services (Hisrich and Peters 1974, Landon and Locander 1978,\nRapoport and Rapoport 1975). The work by Rapoport and Rapoport is\nunique amongst the literature reviewed in this paper in being a British\nanalysis. The results, of these several attempts to relate the f.l.c. to\nconsumption have been mixed. Hisrich and Peters found it to be a better\npredictor than other variables such as age and social class. Dominguez and\nPage (1984) also found it to be a very significant explanatory variable but\nother authors (Derrick and Lehfeld, Jain, and Wagner and Hanna) have\nbeen much more critical. Some of this criticism seems to stem from a false\nappreciation of the concept which may lead to overexpectations about its\npredictive capacity. The multifaceted nature of the f.l.c. with its reflections\nof age, children and income would obviously seem important for a whole\nrange of products related to homemaking, education, health and leisure.\nHowever it is important to draw on the distinction between needs and\nwants which is quite clearly amplified in all basic texts on marketing and\nconsumer behaviour. The f.l.c. is highly correlated to many needs but on its\nown says nothing about the individual wants of people in meeting those\nneeds. Thus it has to be used with other predictor variables such as direct\nmeasures of income, social class, personality or attitudes. . _\nReynolds and Wells (1977) also point out a further problem in using the\nf.l.c. to explain consumption. In empirical work it may be difficult to\ndivorce trends which may be associated with the f.l.c. from other general\nsocial trends. For example, because clothing or cosmetics fashions change\nrapidly over time it can be almost impossible to effectively evaluate the\nseparate effects of the life cycle on a family's consumption of these products.\nThus in a time series analysis one has an addtional problem in applying\nwhat is essentially a static concept which requires continual updating in\norder to maintain its relevance to demographic patterns (Murphy and\nStaples 1979, Trost 1974).\nWork in consumer behaviour on the f.l.c. and decision making processes\ncan also be traced back to the 1950s (Wolgast 1958).

This decrease in joint decision making is generally ascribed to\ntwo factors. In the early stages of a new family a high degree of joint\ndecision making is necessary as the partners adjust to each other's values\nand norms of behaviour and individual roles become stabilised. Once a state\nof general consensus has been reached role specialisation takes place and\nindividual decision making becomes a more efficient mechanism. A further\ninfluence is time pressure. Kenkel (1961) found that joint decision making\ndecreased in the presence of children due to the additional time pressures\nexerted by their demands.\nChildren, too, have a part to play in the decision making of the family\nand though this aspect is not so well researched as simple husband/wife\ninteraction it is evident that their roles and influence vary greatly with age.\nChurchill and Moschis (1979) and Ward (1974) both describe aspects of the\nsocialisation process showing clearly how children's decision making behav-\niour changes over time. Additionally Ward and Wackman (1972) have\nshown how children's attempts to influence their parents and their rates of\nsuccess also vary with age.\nOne largely unconsidered aspect of family decision making concerns the\npatterns that evolve after the children leave home. Nicholas (1977) studied\nthe effects of retirement on the power and status of the male in consumer\ndecision making and noted an increase in syncratic decisions amongst\ncouples in the area of convenience goods. Bloode and Wolfe (1960) and Hill\n(1965) both describe how the husband's influence declines as the resources\nhe contributes to the family decline; a normal feature after retirement. Cox\n(1975) and Spiro (1983) have also shown that the later stages of the f.l.c.\nmay also be related to higher degrees of conflict in purchasing decisions. All\nthese conclusions match the preliminary findings of other work being done\nby the author which suggests that joint decision making may increase again\ntowards the end of the f.l.c. The reasons for this have not yet been fully\nsubstantiated but can be attributed to three possible factors:\n(a) an equalising of status as the contribution to resources from each\nspouse is more balanced (this so-called contribution theory lies behind\nmost of the work mentioned above);\n(b) an increase in the time available to the couple;\n(c) lower overall income levels result in higher levels of perceived risk\nbeing associated with more decisions. The work of Davis and Rigaux\n(1974) shows how joint decision making is related to levels of\nperceived risk, associated with products.\nThis review of the literature on the f.l.c. has demonstrated the theoretical\nvalue of the concept both to the manager and the researcher.

The first of\nthese factors has only changed very marginally over the last twenty years\nwith, at 85% to 83%, a slightly higher percentage of females to males over\nthe age of 19 participating in marriage at some time in their lives. A\ncomplicating factor when considering marriage and the formation of the\nfamily is that of cohabitation. Table 2 shows how cohabitation has\nincreased in the 1980s. Since 1964 the percentage of women cohabiting\nwith their husbands before marriage increased from 2% to 21% of those\nmarried between 1979 and 1982.\nTABLE 2\nCohabitation\n1979 1983\nPercentage of women cohabiting Aged 18-24 4.5 5.2\nAged 25-49 2.2 3.2\nAll aged 18-49 2.7 3.6\nSource: Social Trends 1986, Table 2.19.\nThese trends in cohabitation give rise to two specific problems.

Secondly, the rising trend in\ncohabitation confuses distinctions between the young single and newly\nmarried phases of the f.l.c. with respect to buyer behaviour. The figures\nquoted above suggest that cohabitation is often a forward extension of the\nnewly married phase and consequently may be characterised by the usual\nhomemaking behaviour. However cohabitation may originate on a much\nmore casual basis and in the early stages may result in little difference in\nmany aspects of purchasing from the young single pattern.

However other studies, though none very recent (Finer 1974, Reid\n1977), have consistently shown how age at first marriage varies by two to\nthree years across social class so that one can expect the young single phase\nto last much longer amongst the higher socioeconomic groups.\n(b) Procreation\nThe main trend here is the fall in the simple crude birth rate from 17.8 per\n1,000 in 1961 to 16.1 per 1,000 in 1971 and 12.9 per 1,000 in 1981.\nAccompanying this general fall there are some interesting trends which\naffect the nature and composition of the f.l.c. Examination of age specific\nbirth rates (Social Trends 1986, Table 1.11, p. 25) shows both the trend to\nsmaller families and shorter periods between the birth of the children, so\nthat families are started later and completed earlier; i.e. the newly married\nand the empty nest phases of the f.l.c. are both lasting longer. The\nlengthening of the newly married phase is also confirmed by the median\ninterval between marriage and the first birth, which has increased from 20\nmonths in 1971 to 29 months in 1984 (Social Trends 1986, Table 2.23).\nThe length of the newly married phase is also related to social class.

Illegitimate births have risen from 6% of total live births in 1961\nto 17% in 1984. In part this is due to the trends in cohabitation detailed\nabove but it is also concerned with the increasing number of lone mothers\nwho have no defined place within the normal concept of the f.l.c* Likewise\nthe traditional f.l.c. makes no provision for double families. In 1984 41,000\nlegitimate children were born to women in their second or later marriages\nout of a total of 526,000 live births (7.79%). The same figures for 1961 were\n16,000 and 763,000 (2.1%).\n(c) Divorce\nThe most significant alteration to the structure of the f.l.c. proposed by\nMurphy and Staples (op. cit.) was the inclusion of categories for divorced\nparents with and without children. In the UK divorce rates have risen from\n2.1 persons per 1,000 married people in 1961 to 12.0 in 1984 (Social Trends\n1986, Table 2.15) making the inclusion of these categories equally relevant\nfor this country. Underlying these crude figures there are other distributions\nwhich affect the f.l.c. Table 5 shows how divorce rates vary with the length\nof marriage. There has been remarkably little change in this distribution\nover time except for an increase in the 3-4 year (probably early full nest)\ncategory. However the figures do reveal the most likely times for a\nmarriage, and hence the f.l.c, to break down. They are consistent with\npatterns quoted in the United States (Kerkhoff 1976) and other work on\nmarital satisfaction over the life cycle (Schram 1979).\nDivorce also varies by social class to a very great extent.

This reliance is becoming less and less\ntrue. Since 1961 the number of married women in employment in the UK\nhas more than doubled to over 8m whilst the number of single women\nworking has remained fairly constant at between 3.5m and 4m over the\nsame period. In most cases this represents the formation of dual income\nfamilies rather than women becoming economically active in place of their\nhusbands. Obviously this trend affects the income/needs relationship postu-\nlated by Rowntree and is likely to make the f.l.c. a less accurate predictor of\nsome purchasing behaviour within some families (Ferber and Birnbaum\n1980, Schaniger and Allen 1981). The most likely areas of buyer behaviour\nto be affected are those concerned with expenditure on more discretionary\nitems such as holidays or purchases during the secondary homemaking\nphase. In a dual income family these may be ongoing purchases through\nevery stage of the life cycle and not associated so specifically with later full\nnest and empty nest stages.\nIt is to be expected that dual income families will also be affected in their\nconsumer behaviour by the additional time pressures which they have; and\nthat this will result in higher expenditure on time saving products and the\nuse of time saving methods in their shopping activities. However empirical\nwork trying to establish a direct link between working wives and time\nsaving behaviour has met with mixed results. Reilly (1981) incorporates the\nconcept of role overload to explain this. He emphasises that not all\nemployment may result in role overload for the wife depending upon other\naspects of the family structure\u2014for example the number of children, the\ncontribution of the husband and intergenerational ties that may allow\ninputs from outside the nuclear family. Ultimately what is important in\ndetermining time saving aspects of consumer behaviour is the value placed\non time by a family and studies have shown this to relate not only to dual\nemployment but also to income, education and stage of the family life cycle\n(Bellante and Foster 1984, Reilly 1981).\nThe absorption of married women into the labour force has taken place\nmore or less evenly over social classes thus affecting the f.l.c. equally across\nall strata of society. Across the f.l.c. itself there are substantial variations in\nthe number of working women.

As Rimmer and Popay (1983) say it is no longer marriage which\nhas any affect on female employment but rather childbirth. The attainment\nof school age by the youngest child is accompanied by a gradual return to\nwork of the mothers and this will have a marked effect- on the income\navailable for the later full nest stages of the f.l.c. It would appear that the\ntrend shown in Table 8 is a changing one since Rimmer and Popay also\nshow that the fastest growth in working mothers since 1971 has been in the\ngroup with very young children. With high unemployment levels and\nreasonable maternity leave arrangements it may well be that the incentive\nto continue working through the young child phase will result in fewer\nvariations over the f.l.c. in future.\nTABLE 8\nEmployment status of married and lone mothers by age of youngest child\nMarried mothers\nLone mothersNot working\nPart-time\nFull-time\nNot working\nPart-time\nFull-time0-4\n74\n21\n6\n83\n11\n6Age of youngest child\n5-9\n43\n44\n12\n58\n29\n1410+\n31\n44\n25\n45\n26\n28All ages\n51\n35\n14\n61\n22\n17\nSource: Social Trends, 1986.\nRimmer and Popay also make the point that the employment of women\nalso affects the decision making patterns of the household. Since employ-\nment varies over the life cycle this will have a contributory effect to the\nrelationships outlined earlier between decision making and the f.l.c. It is\ngenerally accepted that because of the increased time constraint with both\npartners working there will be fewer joint or syncratic decisions. What is\nunclear is whether this results in increased role specialisation, and therefore\nmore husband and wife dominated decisions, or whether the financial\nindependence of the female results in more autonomic decisions being taken;\ni.e. more independent decision making but with topics equally shared\nbetween partners. In the UK this is a completely unresearched aspect of\nconsumer behaviour and sociologists who have conducted general research\non decision making within the family have not been able to reach agreed\nconclusions as to whether role relationships within families are really\nbecoming less rigid or not (Rimmer and Popay 1983).\nTHE F.L.C.

This may be seen as\nrestrictive but the presence of other persons is certain to influence the\nbehaviour of the family and strictly speaking has no place in any form of\nthe f.l.c. as related to western nucleated families.\n(2) The bachelor stage is based upon the number of single households\naged under 35, less an allowance for a proportion not marrying and\ntherefore not entering the f.l.c. at all. The size of this segment is probably\nunderestimated since a large proportion of people may live communally in\nhouseholds of two or more. As indicated earlier when discussing cohabi-\ntation it is difficult to reach general conclusions on what impact these\narrangements may have on consumer behaviour. The marketing manager\nselling bath cleaner may reasonably see young singles living together as a\ncommon household but this may be quite improper for the clothes retailer.\n(3) Figures for the newly married stage are based on married couples\naged under 35 less a percentage likely to remain childless.\n(4) The Full Nest stages of the Wells and Gubar scheme require a split at\nage 6. Since UK census data classifies children on the basis of 0-4 and 5^9\na fairly crude adjustment had to be made in the classification. It may be\nthat pre-school and school age separation (as per Rodgers) should provide a\nmore meaningful reflection of behaviour. Certainly it reflects a critical point\nin family development in the UK which cannot be associated with age 6.\n(5) Since the census provides no analysis of the age of the head of\nhousehold by age of children it was not possible to separate out Full Nest\nIII from Full Nest II.\n(6) In the Murphy and Staples classification the divorced categories\ninclude all lone parents whether actually married or not. Also it was not\npossible to isolate divorced people without children or without dependent\nchildren from other single people. These categories will form part of the\nsingle households listed under the solitary survivor in the labour force stage\nof Wells and Gubar's classification. The remaining part of that class will be\nwidowed people under pensionable age. It is often the case that people\nwidowed at this time are women without an employment history who are in\nall practical terms unemployable. In these cases income may be restricted to\nState benefits and consumption patterns may closely follow that of the\nretired solitary survivor.\n(7) As Murphy and Staples discovered in their attempts to classify the\nUS population, there are too many possible combinations of children's ages\nto allow for meaningful detailed classifications within the child raising stages\nof both their and Rodger's schemes.\n(8) The middle aged (a) and (e) categories of the Murphy and Staples\nclassification had to be separated on the basis of age: 35 to 44 and 45 to 64.\n(a) is likely to be fairly accurate but (e) will also include a number of\nfamilies who have never had children as well as those truly in the Empty\nNest stage.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3176, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c352746a-69ca-4646-8baa-8c87ad2810aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "c352746a-69ca-4646-8baa-8c87ad2810aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d692fe6-d3a3-4197-b40a-9a697bf0356d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "40c05ede50615a6d7dc1cb870e3fde3e1817f65e8e16a9a849bb5cb195808237", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "952a771b-63c0-4835-bd87-44550fda8af3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "19da1e02308cbfd149a51192e47a068200886cdef0c584a27c8b2f4cbc8ca8cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "645e77d2-fc22-4003-8bd1-f553bb72a5a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8893d27792f11eb1b61b90e977b3e8aa93cd08daea6990802c1d034bba7256f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "28 ROB W. LAWSON\nMost of the points listed above relate to the interpretation of the data\nfrom the census. However they also reveal perhaps the major problem that\nemerges from all these schemes in how to treat young single people and the\ndispersal stage of the f.l.c. The earliest of the schemes (Rodgers) tackles the\nproblem by having a launching phase but not including a separate young\nsingles phase as do Wells and Gubar and Murphy and Staples. Wells and\nGubar are definite in not including a dispersal phase in their classification\nbut the position of Murphy and Staples is more ambiguous. The heading of\ntheir stage 4(e) \"Middle Aged without Dependent Children\" may be taken\nto imply that non-dependent children may still be in the household.\nHowever elsewhere in the paper they say that this phase is equivalent to the\nEmpty Nest I stage of Wells and Gubar which explicitly says \"no children\nliving at home\". In the population analysis for this paper the families with\nnon-dependent children only have been omitted from 4(e) of the Murphy\nand Staples classification. Since these families represent 6.3% of the\nhouseholds in the UK there is a serious omission from the f.l.c. structure.\nNone of the three structures discussed can be seen to treat this problem of\ndispersal and the origin of new family forms well. In reality the situation is\nclear. It takes time for a family to disperse its non-dependent children and\nsome of those children will begin a separate life cycle before their actual\nmarriage. Both aspects can be accounted for by combining the relevant\naspects of the different structures. In this way the percentage of households\ncovered in the UK 1981 census can be raised to 81.31%. The life cycle\nscheme required to do this is a fairly refined one but it is considered\nworthwhile retaining all the separate categories since one would expect\nthem all to reflect differences in incomes and needs and therefore to be\nimportant in reflecting different consumption patterns.\nTABLE 11\nA UK modernised family life cycle\nStage\nBachelor\nNewly married couples\nFull nest 1 (with pre-school children)\nFull nest 1 (lone parent)\nMiddle aged no children (aged 35-44)\nFull nest 2 (school age children)\nFull nest 2 (lone parent)\nLaunching families (with non-dependent children)\nLaunching families (one parent)\nEmpty nest 1 (childless, aged 45-64)\nEmpty nest 2 (retired)\nSolitary survivor under 65\nSolitary survivor retired\nTotalNumber of\nhouseholds\n25,118\n55,018\n210,888\n22,271\n21,017\n300,534\n34,065\n111,563\n25,585\n167,248\n168,308\n47,186\n250,891\n1,439,6920/\n1.42\n3.11\n11.91\n1.26\n1.19\n16.97\n1.92\n6.30\n1.45\n9.45\n9.51\n2.66\n14.17\n81.31\nSource: Household and Family Composition, 1981 Census, 10% sample.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2703, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "645e77d2-fc22-4003-8bd1-f553bb72a5a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "645e77d2-fc22-4003-8bd1-f553bb72a5a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "985ba59d-fe60-430b-aab7-09fae1062d96", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "17e59216fc8f0631489d89271d4a055f5365a6b0ea60a789b885981310a0daae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c352746a-69ca-4646-8baa-8c87ad2810aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "40c05ede50615a6d7dc1cb870e3fde3e1817f65e8e16a9a849bb5cb195808237", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "125dead0-3245-453d-8432-5681aaaf6a8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "003d7887b1b2ecc5480552b116c94132ac37f58ab27ddd5b3c894acb26e95a93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE FAMILY LIFE CYCLE: A DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS 29\nCONCLUDING DISCUSSION\nThis paper has set out to examine in a critical way how well the f.l.c.\nschemes proposed by American researchers fit into UK demographic\npatterns. In the detailed examination of demography it has emphasised the\nchanges that have taken place in marriage patterns, birth rates, divorce,\ndeath and female employment. The impact of these changes may lead the\nreader to query the relevance of the f.l.c. as a concept in modern society.\nHowever, as the report of the Family Policy Studies Centre (1985) makes\nclear there is also great continuity as well as change:\n\u2014Nine out of ten people will marry at some time in their lives;\n\u2014Nine out of ten married couples will have children;\n\u2014Two in every three marriages are likely to be ended by death rather\nthan divorce;\n\u2014Eight out of ten people live in households headed by a married couple.\nIn a further study on Family Trends and Social Security Reform (1986)\nthe Family Policy Studies Centre quote other research from the 1980s which\nsuggests that the \"broad categorisations are still valid. Child rearing and\nold age are periods of relative want whilst adulthood before and after child\nrearing are periods of relative plenty\". Thus the basic principle propounded\nby Rowntree is still applicable and since both income and the scale and\ndefinition of needs are fundamental to understanding consumer require-\nments it would seem that the f.l.c. still holds value for consumer researchers.\nWhat has changed over the past thirty years is the propensity for people not\nto go through all the traditional stages of the f.l.c. within one family and for\nthe stages themselves to have altered in length and importance; so that for\ninstance the full nest stages are shorter due to the falling birth rate and the\ncloser temporal proximity of births, whilst the bachelor and empty nest\nstages have grown in length and size. In terms of predicting consumer\nbehaviour the lack of continuity amongst a particular individual's involve-\nment in a f.l.c. may not matter much at all since the prime use for the\nconcept is in cross-sectional analysis of behaviour for the purposes of market\nsegmentation. As noted earlier it is virtually impossible to isolate the effects\nof the f.l.c. on consumption of a product from other trends working over\ntime, such as changes in general social norms, national income levels or\ntechnology. The same point is true with patterns of decision making over\nthe f.l.c. In twenty years time the changes that may have taken place in\nshopping technology with home computer links for information searching\nand ordering products, may mean that completely different decision making\nprocesses occur over the f.l.c. than is now the case. Thus comparisons of\nwhat a family in the Full Nest I stage of the f.l.c. does now with what it\ndoes in the Empty Nest I stage in twenty years time may be meaningless.\nWhat is important is that a scheme which accurately reflects the demogra-\nphy of the country is employed in any study.\nThe modifications to the f.l.c. suggested in this paper have shown that it", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3115, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "125dead0-3245-453d-8432-5681aaaf6a8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "125dead0-3245-453d-8432-5681aaaf6a8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6c95b76a-d911-47ea-b8a2-76deb79d8571", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "445b9352fe0d2b070cab408269df43f08055cfeac4ed2d72f3b394a98b2625f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "645e77d2-fc22-4003-8bd1-f553bb72a5a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap29.pdf"}, "hash": "17e59216fc8f0631489d89271d4a055f5365a6b0ea60a789b885981310a0daae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7c99b92-223f-4a94-ba2b-3ac0ce345c0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4ef8bc074096a746c646abfb75b9e6a443fc8f27a46db2d489dc8187fd94f3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "30 ROB W.
