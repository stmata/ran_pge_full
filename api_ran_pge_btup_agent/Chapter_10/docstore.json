It has four main steps:2 iden -\ntifying and establishing brand positioning, planning and implementing brand marketing, measuring \nand interpreting brand performance, and growing and sustaining brand value.\nHow Does Branding Work?\nPerhaps the most distinctive skill of professional marketers is their ability to create, maintain, enhance, \nand protect brands, whether established brands such as Mercedes, Sony, and Nike or new ones like \nWarby Parker, Casper, and Tovala.\nThe American Marketing Association defines a brand  as \u201ca name, term, sign, symbol, or design, \nor a combination of them, intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers \nand to differentiate them from those of competitors.\u201d The ultimate purpose of the brand is to create, \nfor consumers, the company, and its collaborators, value that goes beyond the value created by the \nproduct and service aspects of the offering.\nTHE ESSENCE OF BRANDING\nBranding  is the process of endowing products and services with the power of a brand.

Medieval guilds in Europe required that craftspeople put trade -\nmarks on their products to protect themselves and their customers against inferior quality. In the fine \narts, branding began with artists signing their works. Brands today play a number of important roles \nthat improve consumers\u2019 lives and enhance the financial value of firms.\nHow do you \u201cbrand\u201d a product or a service? Although firms provide the impetus for brand cre -\nation through marketing programs and other activities, ultimately a brand resides in the minds and \nhearts of consumers. It is a perceptual entity rooted in reality but reflecting the views and idiosyncra -\nsies of consumers.\nFor branding strategies to be successful and create brand value, consumers must be convinced \nthat there are meaningful differences among brands in the product or service category. Brand differ -\nences are often related to attributes or benefits of the product itself. Gillette, Merck, and 3M have led \ntheir product categories for decades, in part because of continual innovation. Other brands create \ncompetitive advantages through non\u2013product-related means. Gucci, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton have \nbecome category leaders by understanding consumer motivations and desires and creating relevant \nand appealing imagery around their stylish products.\nSuccessful brands are seen as genuine and authentic in what they sell and who they are.3 A success -\nful brand makes itself an indispensable part of its customers\u2019 lives. Once a faded preppy afterthought, \nJ.Crew tripled its revenue by becoming a highly creative force in fashion. By constantly introducing \nnew styles while retaining a cohesive look, the brand enjoys intense loyalty, numerous fan blogs, and \nhigh-profile celebrity supporters like Michelle Obama and Anna Wintour.\nMarketers can apply branding virtually anywhere a consumer has a choice. It\u2019s possible to brand \na physical good (Tesla automobile or Lipitor cholesterol medication), a service (Singapore Airlines \nor Blue\u00a0Cross Blue Shield medical insurance), a store (Nordstrom or Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods), a place \n(the city of Sydney or the country of Ireland), an organization (U2 or the American Automobile \n Association), or an idea (abortion rights or free trade).\nBranding has become of great importance in sports, arts, and entertainment. One of the world\u2019s \ntop sports brands comes from Madrid, Spain.\nReal Madrid  Real Madrid surpassed Manchester United in 2013 to become the world\u2019s \nmost valuable team in soccer\u2014or football, as it is known outside the United States\u2014with an \nestimated value of $3.3 billion. Also known by fans as \u201cLos Merengues,\u201d the iconic but floundering \nclub began to thrive when the billionaire construction tycoon Florentine Perez took over in 2000. \nPerez\u2019s strategy was to attract some of the very top players in the game, brand names in their \nown right, such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, and, later, Cristiano Ronaldo. Success on \nthe pitch (field) allowed Perez to develop three distinct and lucrative lines of business: broadcast \nrights, sponsorship and endorsement revenue, and match-day revenue. Real Madrid is truly a \nglobal brand and derives much of its revenue abroad. Sponsorship includes high-profile deals \nwith Adidas, Emirates Airlines, and Spanish banking group BBVA.4\nTHE ROLE OF BRANDS\nBrands identify the maker of a product and allow consumers to assign responsibility for its per -\nformance to that maker or distributor. Brands perform a number of functions for both consumers \nand\u00a0firms.\nBrands\u2019 Role for Consumers.  A brand is a promise the firm makes to the consumer. It is a \nmeans to set consumers\u2019 expectations and reduce their risk. In return for customer loyalty, the firm \npromises that its products or services will reliably deliver a predictably positive experience and set of \ndesirable benefits. A brand may even be \u201cpredictably unpredictable\u201d if that is what consumers expect, \nbut the key is that it fulfills or exceeds customer expectations in satisfying their needs and wants.\nConsumers may evaluate the identical product differently depending on how it is branded. For \nexample, consumers might be willing to pay $100 for a generic (unbranded) leather bag but ten times \nmore for the same bag carrying the brand of Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, or Gucci.

We \ndiscuss these two concepts and the relationship between them next.\nBrand Equity.  The monetary value of a brand is called brand equity  and reflects the premium \nthat is placed on a company\u2019s valuation because of its ownership of the brand. Brand equity encom -\npasses the net present value of the total financial returns that the brand will generate over its lifetime. \nUnderstanding the concept of brand equity, managing its antecedents and consequences, and devel -\noping methodologies to assess brand equity are of the utmost importance for ensuring a company\u2019s \nfinancial well-being.\nPrior to the wave of mergers and acquisitions in the 1980s, including the $25 billion RJR Nabisco \nbuyout, companies spent millions of dollars on brand building with no established accounting pro -\ncedures in place to assess the value of the brands they created. The spate of mergers and acquisitions \nspiked interest in brand valuation and led to more accurate ways to measure brand equity. Putting a fair Coca-Cola  Battered by a nationwide series of taste-test challenges from sweeter-tasting \nPepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola decided in 1985 to replace its old formula with a sweeter variation \ndubbed New Coke. The company spent $4 million on market research, and blind taste tests \nshowed that Coke drinkers preferred the new formula. But the launch of New Coke provoked a \nnational uproar. Market researchers had measured the taste but failed to adequately measure the \nemotional attachment consumers had to Coca-Cola. There were angry letters, formal protests, \nand even lawsuit threats to force the retention of \u201cThe Real Thing.\u201d Ten weeks later, the company \nreintroduced its century-old formula as \u201cClassic Coke.\u201d Efforts to resuscitate New Coke eventually \nfailed, and the brand disappeared around 1992. Ironically, the failed introduction of New Coke \nended up giving the old formula measurably stronger status in the marketplace, with more \nfavorable attitudes and greater sales as a result. Interestingly, 34 years later, New Coke made a \nbrief comeback as part of a promotional campaign with Netflix, when it was featured in several \nepisodes of the third season of the sci-fi thriller \u201cStranger Things\u201d and was made available in retail \nchannels for a limited time.13>> The hue and cry \nraised by passionately \nloyal fans forced  \nCoca-Cola to ditch \nits heavily researched \nlaunch of New Coke and \nreinstate the company\u2019s \ncentury-old formula. \nSource: Todd Gipstein/Getty Images", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3347cf3-adb3-48b1-b806-858b23cc178d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3347cf3-adb3-48b1-b806-858b23cc178d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "267d4159-f1eb-44f7-b932-53985e689391", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "694389601aef4104ad6d5a69095baa97365abbf490b71613409f98ec7dcb9cb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d964dbe-44cb-4d6f-b40d-066c46861eb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "5f9c32a8f3979255b178b961101eba2fa02d05396e03cef46dd855785408b8c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd5d2898-a061-414c-bd53-a43f0f4a44d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3acadc0e5af9e2ae079fcec862127a6fd137cd0bb662b94cac341bb06ec941e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 10    |  BUILDING  STRoNG BRANDS  213\ndollar amount on the brand assets that a firm has accrued through the years is vital, because the value \nof its brands is not reflected in the company\u2019s books and could exceed its tangible assets.\nBrand equity is included in the accounting term goodwill , which is the monetary value of all \nintangible assets of a company. Goodwill not only documents the company\u2019s tangible assets, such as \nproperty, infrastructure, materials, and investments, but also incorporates the intangible assets that \na company owns, including brands, patents, copyrights, know-how, licenses, distribution arrange -\nments, company culture, and management practices. Thus, goodwill is a much broader term than \nbrand equity and includes both the value of the company\u2019s brand and the value of the company\u2019s \nother intangible assets.\nMeasuring Brand Equity.  Although the importance of brand equity is undisputed, there is \nno universally agreed-on method for assessing the equity of a brand accurately.17 Several alternative \n methods exist, all of which emphasize different means of gauging brand equity. The cost approach , the \nmarket approach , and the financial approach  are the three most common methods of measuring brand \nequity.\n\u2022 The cost approach  calculates brand equity by examining the costs of developing the brand, such \nas marketing research, brand design, communication, management, and legal costs. The cost \nmethod can hinge on the historical costs of creating the brand, which include an estimate of all \nrelevant brand-building expenditures; alternatively, it can be based on the brand\u2019s replacement \ncost\u2014the monetary expense of rebuilding the brand\u2014at the time of valuation.\n\u2022 The market approach  estimates brand equity by measuring the difference between the sales rev -\nenues from a branded offering against those of an identical unbranded offering, adjusted for the \nexpense of building the brand. Assessing the value of the Morton Salt brand, for example, would \nentail comparing the sales revenues generated by the Morton product with the sales revenues \ngenerated by its generic equivalent\u2014regular salt\u2014minus the cost of building and managing the \nbrand.\n\u2022 The financial approach  evaluates brand equity as the net present value (NPV) of a brand\u2019s future \nearnings and usually encompasses three key steps: computing the company\u2019s future cash flow, \nestimating the brand\u2019s contribution to the company\u2019s future cash flow, and adjusting this cash flow \nusing a risk factor that accounts for the volatility of the earnings that are attributable to the\u00a0brand.\nEach of the three approaches has its advantages and shortcomings. Therefore, a company can \nbenefit from using multiple methods and alternative approaches to measuring brand value. Such \napproaches must take into account the strategic value of the brand and, specifically, the brand\u2019s power \nto influence the behavior of different market entities.\nBrand Power.  Brand power , also referred to as customer-based brand equity, is the ancillary \nvalue contributed by the brand to a product or a service.18 Brand power reflects the degree to which \nthe brand influences the way consumers think, feel, and act with respect to the brand.\nBrand power is thus the differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the \nmarketing of that brand.19 A brand has positive power if consumers react more favorably to a product \nand the way it is marketed when the brand is identified than when it is not identified. A brand has \nnegative power if consumers react less favorably to marketing activity for the brand under the same \ncircumstances.\nBrand power arises from differences in consumer response that a brand evokes. If no differences \noccur, the brand-name product is essentially a commodity, and competition will probably be based \non price. Furthermore, differences in response are a result of consumers\u2019 brand knowledge, as well as \nof all the thoughts, feelings, images, experiences, and beliefs associated with the brand.

In an abstract sense, we can think of brand equity as providing marketers with a vital \nstrategic bridge from their past to their future.\nMarketers should also think of the marketing dollars spent on products and services each year as \ninvestments in consumer brand knowledge. The quality, rather than the quantity, of that investment is \nthe critical factor. It\u2019s possible to overspend on brand building if money is not spent wisely.\nCustomers\u2019 brand knowledge dictates appropriate future directions for the brand. Consumers \nwill decide, based on what they think and feel about the brand, where (and how) they believe the \nbrand should go, and they will (or will not) grant permission to any marketing action or program. \nNew-product ventures such as Bengay aspirin, Cracker Jack cereal, Frito-Lay lemonade, Fruit of the \nLoom laundry detergent, and Smucker\u2019s premium ketchup all failed because consumers found them \ninappropriate extensions of the brand.\nMeasuring Brand Power.  How do we measure brand power? An indirect  approach assesses \npotential sources of brand power by identifying and tracking consumer brand knowledge.21 A direct  \napproach assesses the actual impact of brand knowledge on consumer response to different aspects \nof the marketing.\nThe two general approaches are complementary, and marketers can employ both. In other words, \nfor brand power to perform a useful strategic function and guide marketing decisions, marketers need \nto fully understand (1) the sources of brand equity and how they affect outcomes of interest and (2)\u00a0how \nthese sources and outcomes change, if at all, over time. Brand audits are important for the former, \nbrand tracking for the latter.\n\u2022 A brand audit  is a focused series of procedures to assess the health of the brand, uncover its \nsources of brand equity, and suggest ways to improve and leverage its equity. Marketers should \nconduct a brand audit when setting up marketing plans and when considering shifts in strate -\ngic direction. Conducting brand audits on a regular basis, such as annually, allows marketers to \nkeep their finger on the pulse of their brands so they can manage them more proactively and \n responsively. A good brand audit provides keen insights into consumers, brands, and the relation -\nship between the two.\n\u2022 In brand tracking , the brand audit is used as input to collect quantitative data from consumers \nover time, providing consistent, baseline information about how brands and marketing programs \nare performing. Brand-tracking studies help us understand where, to what degree, and in what \nways brand value is being created to facilitate day-to-day decision making.\nOne firm that conducted a major brand audit and redefined its brand positioning is Kellogg.\nKellogg Company  The ready-to-eat cereal category has been under siege in recent years \nas busy consumers choose to eat on the run, while nutrition-minded consumers worry about \ngenetically modified ingredients. With a history spanning more than a century, Kellogg decided \nit needed to refresh the brand and address the issues head-on. An extensive brand audit, called \n\u201cProject Signature,\u201d was launched to provide strategic direction and creative inspiration. A year \nof collaboration with brand-consulting partner Interbrand resulted in a new tagline, \u201cLet\u2019s Make \nToday Great\u201d; an updated design and more contemporary logo; clear identification of the brand\u2019s \ncore purpose as highlighting the \u201cpower of breakfast\u201d; explicit incorporation of the Kellogg master \nbrand into all its marketing campaigns; and consolidation of 42 company websites around the \nworld into one. The brand audit influenced a number of Kellogg\u2019s specific marketing programs \nand activities, from the cause-related \u201cShare Your Breakfast\u201d campaign (to help the one in five \nU.S. children who might not have access to breakfast) to the \u201cLove Your Cereal\u201d social media \nprogram debunking myths about cereal. An olympic sponsor, Kellogg also devotes a percentage \nof its communication budget to online engagement.22\nMarketers should distinguish brand equity from brand valuation, which is the job of estimating \nthe\u00a0total financial value of the brand. In well-known companies, brand value is typically more than \nhalf the total company market capitalization.

However, \ncompanies do give it a value in countries such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Australia.\nDesigning the Brand\nMarketers build brand equity by creating the right brand associations in consumers\u2019 minds. The \nsuccess of this process depends on all brand-related contacts with consumers\u2014whether marketer-\ninitiated or not.23\nDEFINING THE BRAND MANTRA\nTo focus brand positioning and guide the way their marketers help consumers think about the brand, \nfirms can define a brand mantra. A brand mantra  is a three- to five-word articulation of the heart \nand soul of the brand and is closely related to other branding concepts like \u201cbrand essence\u201d and \u201ccore \nbrand promise.\u201d The mantra\u2019s purpose is to guide the actions of all employees within the organization, \nand of all external marketing partners, by ensuring that they understand what the brand fundamen -\ntally should represent to consumers.\nBrand mantras are powerful devices. By highlighting points of difference, they provide guidance \nabout what products to introduce under the brand, what ad campaigns to run, and where and how \nto sell the brand. Their influence can even extend beyond these tactical concerns. Brand mantras can \nguide the most seemingly unrelated or mundane decisions, such as the look of a reception area and \nthe way phones are answered. In effect, they create a mental filter to screen out brand-inappropriate \nmarketing activities or actions of any type that may have a negative effect on customers\u2019 impressions.\nBrand mantras must economically communicate what the brand is and what it is not. What makes \na good brand mantra? McDonald\u2019s \u201cFood, Folks, and Fun\u201d captures its brand essence and core brand \npromise.

Nike\u2019s internal mantra, \u201cauthentic athletic performance,\u201d was not directly com -\nmunicated to consumers, who were presented, instead, with the slogan \u201cJust Do It\u201d that aimed to \ncapture the brand mantra. There are three key criteria for a brand mantra. First, a good brand mantra \nshould communicate  what is unique about the brand. It may also need to define the brand\u2019s category (or \ncategories) and set brand boundaries. Second, it should simplify the essence of the brand: It should be \nshort, crisp, and vivid in meaning. Finally, it should inspire by staking out ground that is personally \nmeaningful and relevant to as many employees as possible.\nFor brands anticipating rapid growth, it is helpful to define the product or benefit space in which \nthe brand would like to compete, as Nike did with \u201cathletic performance\u201d and Disney with \u201cfamily \nentertainment.\u201d Words that describe the nature of the product or service, or the type of experiences or \nbenefits the brand provides, can be critical to identifying appropriate categories into which to extend. \nFor brands in more stable categories where extensions are less likely to occur, the brand mantra may \nfocus exclusively on points of difference.\nOther brands may be strong on one, or perhaps even a few, of the brand associations that make \nup the company\u2019s brand mantra. However, for a mantra to be effective, no other brand should singu -\nlarly excel on all its dimensions. Part of the key to the success of both Nike and Disney is that for many \nyears, no competitor could really deliver on the combined promise suggested by their brand mantras.\nCHOOSING BRAND ELEMENTS\nBrand elements are devices that identify and differentiate the brand. Most strong brands employ \nmultiple brand elements, which can be trademarked. Nike has the distinctive \u201cswoosh\u201d logo, the \nempowering \u201cJust Do It\u201d slogan, and the \u201cNike\u201d name from the Greek winged goddess of victory. \nMarketers should choose brand elements that build as much brand equity as possible. The test of the \nappropriateness of a particular brand element is what consumers would think or feel about the prod -\nuct or service if the brand element were all they knew . Based on its name alone, for instance, a consumer \nmight expect SnackWell\u2019s products to be healthful snack foods and Panasonic Toughbook laptop \ncomputers to be durable and reliable.\nThere are several factors to consider when choosing brand elements. They should be memorable, \nmeaningful, and likable, as well as transferable, adaptable, and protectable. The first three characteris -\ntics are brand-building. The latter three are defensive; they help maintain leverage and preserve brand \nequity against challenges.Disney  Disney developed its brand mantra in response to its incredible growth through \nlicensing and product development during the mid-1980s. In the late 1980s, Disney became \nconcerned that some of its characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, were being used \ninappropriately and becoming overexposed. The characters were on so many products, and were \nmarketed in so many ways, that in some cases it was difficult to discern what the rationale behind \nthe deal could have been to start with. Moreover, because of the characters\u2019 broad exposure \nin the marketplace, many consumers had begun to feel Disney was exploiting its name. Disney \nmoved quickly to ensure that a consistent image\u2014reinforcing its key brand associations\u2014was \nconveyed by all third-party products and services. To that end, Disney adopted the internal \nbrand mantra \u201cfun family entertainment\u201d to filter proposed ventures. opportunities that were not \nconsistent with the brand mantra\u2014no matter how appealing\u2014were rejected. (As useful as that \nmantra was to Disney, adding the word magical  might have made it even more so.)eyes, its entire marketing program\u2014its products and the way they are sold\u2014must reflect that key \nbrand value. over the years, Nike has expanded its brand associations from \u201crunning shoes\u201d to \n\u201cathletic shoes\u201d to \u201cathletic shoes and apparel\u201d to \u201call things associated with athletics (including \nequipment).\u201d Each step of the way, however, it has been guided by its \u201cauthentic athletic \nperformance\u201d brand mantra. For example, as Nike rolled out its successful apparel line, one \nimportant hurdle was that the products\u2019 material, cut, and design must be innovative enough to \ntruly benefit top athletes. At the same time, the company has been careful to avoid using the Nike \nname to brand products that do not fit with the brand mantra (such as casual \u201cbrown\u201d shoes).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4713, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d51b7b1-d820-492c-b5bb-c789fe8d0b6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d51b7b1-d820-492c-b5bb-c789fe8d0b6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de0561e9-7447-45a9-a342-6a9ca94fa12e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "1e3358ce8bef59a7a781dcef3fa97483f9a1c7b971f8797d908f022ed72ff4fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05668faa-c969-4ce3-9947-649d51d3c1cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "4e4fa34d8aa2fc7e0cc742750a8132f8b060d2a200047f05bbfb2f83ae51db66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a40a30e0-c132-45c0-b953-d9f5c99bf393", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7067b58915bd3f99dca0b89f7af3e2c8a73a8e4f544dfa9e6d6886168669c63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 10    |  BUILDING  STRoNG BRANDS  217\n\u2022 Memorable \u2014How easily do consumers recall and recognize the brand element, and when?

Alternatively, Burton could \nrely on its rural New England origins, but this geographic location would seem to have little relevance \nto surfing. Burton could also sell through popular surf shops in the hope that their credibility would \nrub off on the Dominator brand. Burton could co-brand by identifying a strong ingredient brand for \nits foam or fiberglass materials (as Wilson did by incorporating Goodyear tire rubber on the soles of \nits Pro Staff Classic tennis shoes).\nAnother approach for Burton would be to find one or more top professional surfers to endorse \nthe surfboard, or it could sponsor a surfing competition or even the entire Association of Surfing \n Professionals (ASP) World Tour. Finally, Burton could secure and publicize favorable ratings from third-\nparty sources such as the magazines Surfer  and Surfing . Thus, independent of the associations created \nby the surfboard itself, its brand name, or any other aspects of the marketing program, Burton could \nbuild equity by linking the brand to these other entities.\nLeveraging secondary associations can be an efficient and effective way to strengthen a brand. But \nlinking a brand to someone or something else can be risky, because anything bad that happens to that \nother entity may also be linked to the brand. When popular endorsers Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong \ngot into trouble, many of the firms that were using them to promote their brands chose to cut ties.\nA brand\u2019s secondary associations must be aligned with the brand\u2019s personality. A brand \n personality  is the specific mix of human traits that we can attribute to a particular brand. Defining \nthe personality of a brand is important because consumers tend to choose brands whose personalities \nmatch their own. Researchers have identified the following brand personality traits:34 Sincerity (down \nto earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), Excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up-to-date), \nCompetence (reliable, intelligent, and successful), Sophistication (upper-class and charming), and \n Ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough). A brand personality may have several attributes: Levi\u2019s suggests a \npersonality that is youthful, rebellious, authentic, and American.\nA cross-cultural study exploring the generalizability of the brand personality scale outside the \nUnited States found that three of the five factors applied in Japan and Spain, but that a \u201cpeaceful -\nness\u201d dimension replaced \u201cruggedness\u201d in both countries, and a \u201cpassion\u201d dimension emerged in Spain \ninstead of \u201ccompetence.\u201d35 Research on brand personality in Korea revealed two culture-specific \n factors\u2014\u201cpassive likableness\u201d and \u201cascendancy\u201d\u2014reflecting the importance of Confucian values in \nthe Korean social and economic systems.36\nBrand Hierarchy\nBrand hierarchy  reflects the way in which a company\u2019s brands are related to a company\u2019s prod -\nucts and services, as well as to one another. Developing a meaningful brand hierarchy is particularly \nimportant for companies that are managing diverse brand portfolios.\nMANAGING BRAND PORTFOLIOS\nA brand can be stretched only so far, and it is possible that not all segments that the firm would like \nto target view the brand in an equally favorable light. Marketers often need multiple brands in order \nto pursue multiple consumer segments. Other reasons for introducing multiple brands in a category \ninclude increasing shelf presence and retailer dependence in the store, retaining variety-seeking  \nconsumers who may otherwise switch to another brand, increasing competition within the firm, and \nexploiting economies of scale in advertising, sales, merchandising, and physical distribution.37\nThe brand portfolio  is the set of all brands and brand lines that a particular firm offers for sale in \na particular category or market segment. Building a good brand portfolio requires careful thinking and \ncreative execution. The hallmark of an optimal brand portfolio is the ability of each brand it contains \nto maximize equity in combination with all the other brands. Marketers generally need to trade off \nmarket coverage with costs and profitability. If they can increase profits by dropping brands, a portfolio \nis too big; if they can increase profits by adding brands, it\u2019s not big enough.\nThe basic principle in designing a brand portfolio is to maximize market coverage so that no tar -\nget customers are ignored but to minimize brand overlap so company brands are not competing for", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4932, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be858506-e7e2-4af5-b9ed-5db692924638": {"__data__": {"id_": "be858506-e7e2-4af5-b9ed-5db692924638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7823b6d3-40c2-4f6a-9700-51e00fab7094", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "e8112f2157a3a5afd9041830d160d299513beaddcbf3e72b30b52a24964cecd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ea3de41-e183-44d8-9f3d-e26dbc3b9098", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "02a06c95a82406fd38a1d24d7df3454078ee08c7718969126ae05c4ef8aff01e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c28c0e8-4cb5-42c5-b2a0-dac8f97769ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1df956167235b7891ef33bcdfb67da845829f1fab890a95eb236a3b27f19460a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "220 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nMarketers carefully monitor brand portfolios over time to identify weak brands and kill unprof -\nitable ones.40 Brands associated with poorly differentiated offerings are likely to be characterized by \ncannibalization and brand dilution. Such overextended and undifferentiated offerings might require \npruning in order to ensure the health of the brand and its ability to create market value.\nThree general brand portfolio strategies are popular:\n\u2022 A house-of-brands strategy  involves individual or separate family brand names.  Consumer \npackaged-goods companies have a long tradition of branding different products by different names. \nGeneral Mills largely uses individual brand names, such as Bisquick, Gold Medal flour, Nature Valley \ngranola bars, Old El Paso Mexican foods, Progresso soup, Wheaties cereal, and Yoplait yogurt. If a \ncompany produces quite different products, one blanket name is often not desirable. Swift & Com -\npany developed separate family names for its hams (Premium) and fertilizers (Vigoro). Companies \noften use different brand names for different quality lines within the same product class. A major \nadvantage of separate family brand names is that if a product fails or appears to be of low quality, \nthe company has not tied the reputation of its other offerings to that product.41\n\u2022 A branded-house strategy  involves a corporate umbrella or company brand name.  Many firms, \nsuch as Heinz and GE, use their corporate brand as an umbrella brand across their entire range \nof products.42 Development costs are lower with umbrella names, because there\u2019s no need to \nresearch a name or spend heavily on advertising to build recognition. Campbell Soup introduces \nnew soups under its brand name with extreme simplicity and achieves instant recognition. Sales \nof the new product are likely to be strong if the manufacturer\u2019s name is good. Corporate-image \nassociations of innovativeness, expertise, and trustworthiness have been shown to directly influ -\nence consumer evaluations.43 Finally, a corporate branding strategy can lead to greater intangible \nvalue for the firm.44 On the downside, however, there is a greater change of a negative spillover \neffect if consumers\u2019 bad experience with one product contaminates their perceptions of other \nproducts associated with the same brand.\n\u2022 A sub-brand strategy  combines two or more corporate, family, or individual product brand \nnames. Kellogg employs a sub-brand or hybrid branding strategy by combining the corporate \nbrand with individual product brands (as with Kellogg\u2019s Rice Krispies, Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran, and \nKellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes). Many durable-goods makers such as Honda, Sony, and Hewlett-Packard \nuse sub-brands for their products. The corporate or company name legitimizes the new product, \nand the sub-brand name individualizes it.\nThe house-of-brands and branded-house strategies represent two ends of a continuum. A sub-\nbrand strategy falls somewhere between, depending on which component of the sub-brand receives \nmore emphasis. A good example of a house-of-brands strategy is used by United Technologies.Dow Corning  Dow Corning has adopted a dual-brand approach to sell its silicon, which \nis used as an ingredient by many companies. Silicon sold under the Dow Corning name uses a \n\u201chigh touch\u201d approach that gives customers much attention and support; silicon sold under the \nXiameter name uses a \u201cno frills\u201d approach emphasizing low prices.38\nUnilever  Unilever, partnering with PepsiCo, sells four distinct brands of ready-to-drink iced tea. \nBrisk Iced Tea is an \u201con ramp\u201d brand that serves as an entry point and a \u201cflavor-forward\u201d value brand; \nLipton Iced Tea is a mainstream brand with an appealing blend of flavors; Lipton Pure Leaf Iced Tea \nis a premium and \u201ctea-forward\u201d brand for tea purists; and Tazo is a super-premium, niche brand.39\nUnited Technologies  United Technology Corporation (UTC) provides a broad range of \nhigh-technology products and services for the aerospace and commercial building industries, \ngenerating nearly $63 billion in revenues. Its aerospace businesses include Sikorsky helicopters, \nPratt & Whitney aircraft engines, and UTC Aerospace Systems (which includes Goodrich \nCorporation and Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace systems). UTC Building & Industrial Systems, \nthe world\u2019s largest provider of building technologies, includes otis elevators and escalators; \nCarrier heating, air-conditioning, and refrigeration systems; and fire and security solutions from \nbrands such as Kidde and Chubb.

It \noften is the first product by which the brand gained fame, a widely accepted best-seller, or a highly \nadmired or award-winning product.46\nFlagship products play a key role in the brand portfolio in that marketing them can have short-\nterm benefits (increased sales) as well as long-term benefits (improved brand equity for a range of \nproducts). Certain models play important flagship roles for many car manufacturers.

There is multiple-sponsor cobranding , such as \nTaligent, a one-time technological alliance of Apple, IBM, and Motorola. Finally, there is retail cobranding  \nin which two retail establishments use the same location to optimize space and profits, such as jointly \nowned Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell restaurants.\nThe main advantage of cobranding is that a product can be convincingly positioned by virtue of \nthe multiple brands. Cobranding can generate greater sales from the existing market and can open \nopportunities to attract new consumers and channels. It can also reduce the cost of product introduc -\ntion because it combines two well-known images and speeds adoption. And cobranding may be a \nvaluable means to learn about consumers and how other companies approach them. Companies in \nthe automotive industry have reaped all these benefits.49\nThe potential disadvantages of cobranding are the risks and lack of control involved in becoming \naligned with another brand in consumers\u2019 minds. Consumer expectations of co-brands are likely to \nbe high, so unsatisfactory performance could have negative repercussions for both brands. And if one \nof the brands enters into a number of cobranding arrangements, overexposure may dilute the transfer \nof any meaningful association.50\nFor cobranding to succeed, the two brands must separately have brand equity\u2014adequate brand \nawareness and a sufficiently positive brand image. The most important requirement is a logical \nfit between the two brands, to maximize the advantages of each while minimizing disadvantages. \n Consumers are more apt to perceive co-brands favorably if they are complementary and offer unique \nquality, rather than being overly similar and redundant.51\nManagers must enter cobranding ventures carefully, looking for the right fit in values, capabilities, \nand goals, along with an appropriate balance of brand equity. There must be detailed plans to legalize \ncontracts, make financial arrangements, and coordinate marketing programs. As one executive at \nNabisco put it, \u201cGiving away your brand is a lot like giving away your child\u2014you want to make sure \neverything is perfect.\u201d Financial arrangements between brands vary; one common approach is for \nthe brand more deeply invested in the production process to pay the other a licensing fee and royalty.\nBrand alliances require a number of decisions. What capabilities do you not have? What resource \nconstraints do you face (people, time, money)? What are your strategic goals? Does partnering help \nstrengthen brand equity? Is there any risk of diluting brand equity? Does the opportunity offer strategic \nadvantages such as knowledge transfer?\nIngredient Branding.  Ingredient branding is a special case of cobranding. It creates brand equity \nfor materials, components, or parts that are necessarily contained within other branded products. For \nhost products whose brands are not that strong, ingredient brands can provide differentiation and \nimportant signals of quality.52\nSuccessful ingredient brands include Dolby noise-reduction technology, the GORE-TEX water-\nresistant fibers, and Scotchgard fabrics. Vibram is the world leader in high-performance rubber soles \nfor outdoor, work, military, recreation, fashion, and orthopedic shoes. Look under your shoe and you \nmay find Vibram soles.

DuPont has introduced a number of  innovative \nproducts, such as Corian\u00ae solid-surface material, for use in markets ranging from apparel to aero -\nspace. Many of its products, such as Tyvek\u00ae house wrap, Teflon\u00ae non-stick coating, and Kevlar\u00ae  \nfiber, became household names as ingredient brands in consumer products manufactured by other \ncompanies.\nMany manufacturers make components or materials that are used in branded products but lose \ntheir individual identity.

Ideally, this intrinsic value \nis easily seen or experienced. Second, consumers must be convinced that the ingredient is superior. \nTo this end, the company must coordinate a communication campaign\u2014often with the help of the \nmanufacturers of the final products and the retailers carrying these products\u2014that helps consumers \nunderstand the advantages of the branded ingredient. Finally, a distinctive symbol or logo must clearly \nsignal that the host product contains the ingredient. Ideally, this symbol or logo functions like a \u201cseal\u201d \nand is simple and versatile, credibly communicating quality and confidence.56\nFIGURE 10.2 \nBrand Value Chain\nSource: Kevin Lane Keller \nand Vanitha Swaminathan, \nStrategic Brand \nManagement , 5th ed.  \n(Upper Saddle River,  \nNJ: Pearson  Education, \n2020), chapter 3.\nMarketing\nProgram\nInvestment\nCustomer\nMultiplier\nMarket\nMultiplier\nProgram\nMultiplierCustomer\nMind-setBrand\nPerformanceShareholder\nValue\n- Product\n- Communications\n- Trade\n- Employee\n- Other- Awareness\n- Associations\n- Attitudes\n- Attachment\n- Activity- Price premiums\n- Price elasticities\n- Market share\n- Expansion success\n- Cost structure\n- Pro\ufb01tability- Stock price\n- P/E ratio\n- Market capitalizationVALUE\nSTAGES\nMULTIPLIERS\n- Distinctiveness\n- Relevance\n- Integrated\n- Value\n- Excellence- Competitive reactions\n- Channel support\n- Customer size & pro\ufb01le- Market dynamics\n- Growth potential\n- Risk pro\ufb01le\n- Brand contributionand product research, development, and design.

The two most common ways in which brands \nevolve are through brand repositioning and brand extensions.\nBRAND REPOSITIONING\nAny new development in the marketing environment can affect a brand\u2019s fortunes. Nevertheless, a \nnumber of brands have managed to make impressive comebacks in recent years.58 After some hard \ntimes in the automotive market, Cadillac, Fiat, and Volkswagen have all turned their brand fortunes \naround to varying degrees. General Motors\u2019s rescue of its fading Cadillac brand was fueled by a com -\nplete overhaul of its product lineup with new designs that redefined its look and styling, such as the \nSRX crossover, the XTS and CTS sedans, the Escalade SUV, and the ATS sports sedan. A healthy dose \nof breakthrough marketing, including the first use of Led Zeppelin\u2019s music in advertising, also helped.\nOften, the first thing to do in repositioning a brand is to understand what the sources of brand \nequity were to begin with. Are positive associations losing their strength or uniqueness? Have negative \nassociations become linked to the brand? Then decide whether to retain the same positioning or to \ncreate a new one (and, if so, what new positioning to create).59\nSometimes the actual marketing program is the source of the problem because it fails to deliver \non the brand promise. Then a \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy may make sense. We\u2019ve mentioned that \n Harley-Davidson regained its market leadership by doing a better job of living up to customer expec -\ntations for product performance. Pabst Brewing Company did the same by returning to its roots and \nleveraging iconic packaging and imagery and a perception of authenticity.\nIn other cases, however, the old positioning is just no longer viable, and a reinvention strategy is \nnecessary. Mountain Dew completely overhauled its brand image to become a soft-drink powerhouse. \nAs its history reveals, it is often easier to revive a brand that is alive but has been more or less forgot -\nten. Old Spice is another example of a brand that transcended its roots as the classic aftershave and \ncologne gift set that baby boomers gave their dads on Father\u2019s Day to become positively identified with \ncontemporary male grooming products for a younger Millennial audience. To revitalize Old Spice, P&G \nused product innovation and tongue-in-cheek communications that stressed the brand\u2019s \u201cexperience.\u201d\nThere is obviously a continuum of repositioning strategies, with pure \u201cback to basics\u201d at one \nend, pure \u201creinvention\u201d at the other, and many combinations in between. The challenge is often to \nchange enough to attract some new customers, but not so much as to alienate old ones.60 Consider \nhow  Burberry made its comeback.\nBurberry  Burberry has an incredible 150-year history. The company\u2019s classic English trench \ncoats were worn by British soldiers in World War I; Sir Ernest Shackleton wore a Burberry during his \nAntarctic expedition; and Burberry has even been designated an official supplier to the royal family. \nBy the turn of the 21st century, though, the brand\u2019s distinctive plaid pattern was no longer cool. It \nhad been splashed over too many products and knocked off by too many counterfeiters. Despite \nthe trench coat\u2019s iconic status, outerwear made up only 20 percent of Burberry\u2019s global business. depends on competitive superiority (the effective-\nness of the marketing investment of other competing \nbrands), channel and other intermediary support (the \namount of brand reinforcement and selling effort that \nvarious marketing partners contribute), and customer \nsize and profile (the number and types of customers, \nprofitable or not, attracted to the brand).\n\u2022 The market multiplier  determines the extent to which \nthe value shown by the market performance of a \nbrand is manifested in shareholder value. It depends, \nin part, on the actions of financial analysts and \ninvestors.Finally, the investment community will consider the market \nperformance of the brand when assessing shareholder \nvalue in general and the value of a brand in particular.\nThe model also assumes that three multipliers \nincrease or decrease the value that can flow from one \nstage to another:\n\u2022 The program multiplier  determines the marketing pro-\ngram\u2019s ability to affect the customer mindset and is a \nfunction of the quality of the program investment.\n\u2022 The customer multiplier  determines the extent to \nwhich the value created in the minds and hearts of \ncustomers affects market performance.

This suite of products allows the firm to advertise that it can fit \u201csix Hondas in a \ntwo-car garage.\u201d\nWhen marketers combine a new brand with an existing brand, the brand extension can also be \ncalled a sub-brand , such as Hershey Kisses candy, Adobe Acrobat software, Toyota Camry automobiles, \nand Courtyard by Marriott hotels. The existing brand that gives birth to a brand extension or sub-brand \nis the parent brand .

Unlike brand extensions, in which a company \nstretches its brand to a product category with which it is not currently associated, in a line extension , \nthe parent brand covers a new product within a product category it currently serves, such as with new \nflavors, forms, colors, ingredients, and package sizes. Dannon has introduced several types of Dannon \nyogurt line extensions through the years\u2014Fruit on the Bottom, All Natural flavors, Danonino, and \nLight & Fit. As we have noted, in a brand extension, marketers use the parent brand to enter a different \nproduct category, such as Swiss Army watches.\nMany firms have decided to leverage their most valuable asset by introducing a host of new prod -\nucts under their strongest brand names.

Moreover, many of the most successful new products, such as Dunkin\u2019 \nDonuts coffee, Progresso Light soups, and Hormel Compleats microwave meals, are brand extensions. \nNevertheless, many new products are introduced each year as new brands.To address this issue, Burberry decided to reinforce its heritage by emphasizing, innovating, and \ngrowing its core luxury products. Targeting the luxury customer of the future, Burberry removed \nthe overworked plaid pattern from 90 percent of its products. The brand was repositioned to gain a \nmore unified and contemporary sensibility, resulting in the creation of more than 300 different coats, \nfrom capes and cropped jackets to classic trenches in a variety of colors and styles. New stores \nwere opened in desirable locations, and training for sales associates was increased. Burberry\u2019s \nonline presence was redesigned to be more appealing to Millennials, featuring emotive brand \ncontent like music, movies, heritage, and storytelling, including simulcasts of Burberry\u2019s runway \nshows.

Besides clothing and \nfragrances, Lauren boutiques sell linens, candles, beds, couches, dishware, photo albums, and \njewelry. Calvin Klein has adopted a similarly successful extension strategy, though with different \nlifestyle imagery.\nMarketers should ask a number of questions when weighing the potential success of an exten -\nsion.62 Does the parent brand have significant power? Is there a strong basis of fit? Will the extension have the optimal \npoints of parity and points of difference? How can marketing programs enhance extension equity? What implications \nwill the extension have for parent brand equity and profitability?\nSome of the key research insights on brand extensions are summarized as follows:63\n\u2022 Successful brand extensions occur when the parent brand is seen as having favorable associations \nand there is a perception of fit between the parent brand and the extension product. This fit can \ninvolve product-related attributes and benefits, as well as attributes and benefits related to com -\nmon usage situations or user types. For example, Ralph Lauren extended its brand from fashion \napparel to perfume, furniture, and even paint.\n\u2022 A brand that is seen as prototypical of a product category can be difficult to extend outside the \ncategory. For example, extending the Coca-Cola brand to fresh-squeezed juices might be chal -\nlenging because of the prototypical nature of the brand in the carbonated cola category. Thus, \nbrand associations that are positive in the original product category can become negative in the \nextension context. In addition, concrete attribute associations tend to be more difficult to extend \nthan abstract benefit associations.\n\u2022 Vertical extensions often require sub-branding strategies to prevent negative brand associations \n(in the case of upscale extensions) and brand dilution and product cannibalization (in the case \nof downscale extensions). For example, rather than using its core brand to launch a downscale \nproduct-line extension, Giorgio Armani introduced a sub-brand\u2014Armani Exchange\u2014which \nhelped mitigate the likelihood of brand dilution and sales cannibalization.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3446, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9006493f-23f1-4b8e-8596-04e707cdb16f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9006493f-23f1-4b8e-8596-04e707cdb16f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddaffcbb-d046-4d17-a797-369bb10656a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "6c65938d74f5cf52ba69d3ac410b5b6b52807b7071be7d9c0aad2337a26a4eec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2977cccd-a53e-43fa-813f-49e546b0d128", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "62fcecc310f107f43a321d733958eb7e7383361ddfd8a398a1ba20c76ad805c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d6b78ae-8020-4c63-ac42-16fcae984484", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1660e263977901efdc7d90e6c98a0f075563afe2af7b72f5ba633f10bea5615", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 10    |  BUILDING  STRoNG BRANDS  227\nOne major mistake in evaluating extension opportunities is failing to take all consumers\u2019 brand \nknowledge into account and focusing instead on one or a few brand associations as a potential basis \nof fit.64 Bic offers a classic example of that mistake.<< Although Bic touted its \n$5 perfumes for men and \nwomen as extending Bic\u2019s \nheritage of convenience \nand affordable quality, \nthe product extension \nwas doomed to failure \nby its incongruity with \nconsumers\u2019 image of the \ncompany.\nSource: PATRICK K oVARIK/AFP/\nGetty Images\nBic By emphasizing inexpensive, disposable products, French company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic was able \nto create markets for nonrefillable ballpoint pens in the late 1950s, disposable cigarette lighters \nin the early 1970s, and disposable razors in the early 1980s. It unsuccessfully tried the same \nstrategy to market Bic perfumes in the United States and Europe. The perfumes\u2014\u201cNuit\u201d and \n\u201cJour\u201d for women and \u201cBic for Men\u201d and \u201cBic Sport for Men\u201d\u2014were packaged in quarter-ounce \nglass spray bottles that looked like fat cigarette lighters and sold for $5 each. The products were \ndisplayed on racks at checkout counters throughout Bic\u2019s extensive distribution channels. At the \ntime, a Bic spokeswoman described the new products as extensions of the Bic heritage\u2014\u201chigh \nquality at affordable prices, convenient to purchase, and convenient to use.\u201d The brand extension \nwas launched with a $20 million advertising and promotion campaign containing images of stylish \npeople enjoying the perfume and using the tagline \u201cParis in Your Pocket.\u201d Nevertheless, Bic was \nunable to overcome its lack of cachet and negative image associations, and the extension was \na\u00a0failure.65\nAdvantages of Brand Extensions.  Consumers form expectations about a new product \nbased on what they know about the parent brand and the extent to which they feel this information is \nrelevant. When Sony introduced a new personal computer tailored for multimedia applications, the \nVAIO, consumers may have felt comfortable with its anticipated performance because of their experi -\nence with and knowledge of other Sony products. Once the VAIO brand gained customer recognition, \nit was spun off from Sony, and it now operates as a stand-alone brand, with Sony maintaining a minor -\nity stake in the company as well as the trademark for the VAIO brand and logo.\nBy setting up positive expectations, extensions reduce risk. It also may be easier to convince retail -\ners to stock and promote a brand extension because of anticipated increased customer demand. An \nintroductory campaign for an extension doesn\u2019t need to create awareness of both the brand and the \nnew product; it can concentrate on the new product itself.66\nExtensions can thus reduce launch costs, which is important because establishing a major new \nbrand name for a consumer packaged good in the U.S. marketplace can cost more than $100 million! \nExtensions also can avoid the difficulty\u2014and expense\u2014of coming up with a new name, thus allow -\ning packaging and labeling efficiencies. Similar or identical packages and labels can lower production \ncosts for extensions and, if coordinated properly, provide more prominence in the retail store via a \n\u201cbillboard\u201d effect.67 Stouffer\u2019s offers a variety of frozen entr\u00e9es with identical orange packaging that \nincreases their visibility when stocked together in the grocer\u2019s freezer. With a portfolio of brand vari -\nants within a product category, consumers who want a change can switch to a different product type \nwithout having to leave the brand family.\nCoca-Cola  To break away from its traditional image and shift to health-focused trends,  \nCoca-Cola decided to launch a range of energy drinks, for the first time using its own brand name. \nThe new energy drink branded \u201cCoca-Cola Energy\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola Energy No Sugar\u201d and made \nwith naturally derived caffeine and guarana extract. This move puts the company\u2019s energy drinks \nin direct competition with Monster Energy, a brand partially owned and distributed by Coca-Cola. \nThe new energy drink also faces an uphill battle trying to change consumers\u2019 perception of the \nCoca-Cola brand, which has traditionally been associated with carbonated colas.68", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4261, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d6b78ae-8020-4c63-ac42-16fcae984484": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d6b78ae-8020-4c63-ac42-16fcae984484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c161876-06f1-4619-ab33-6faa1df052fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "1c3a9cee00752b3128837539e30e2c5f64d02791b70434300ed5d583db7458c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9006493f-23f1-4b8e-8596-04e707cdb16f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "15f0c063f74b3106dff6a9cb292a89d6f10fb075e3b8e4758cd981679086e6eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bbf6b75-062e-485d-b52f-c61ff7926f92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f44a7032fd7f13ca6103033017662a2754e8f6b69e429b32c31de9a7bb3f3e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "228 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nBesides facilitating acceptance of new products, brand extensions can help to clarify the meaning \nof a brand and its core values or improve consumer loyalty to the company creating the extension. \nThrough their brand extensions, Crayola means \u201ccolorful arts and crafts for kids\u201d and Weight Watchers \nmeans \u201cweight loss and maintenance.\u201d\nA successful category extension may not only reinforce the parent brand and open up a new \nmarket but also facilitate even more new category extensions. The success of Apple\u2019s iPod and iTunes \nproducts opened up a new market, boosted sales of core Mac products, and paved the way for the \nlaunch of the iPhone and iPad.\nDisadvantages of Brand Extensions.  On the downside, line extensions may cause the \nbrand name to be less strongly identified with any one product.69 By linking its brand to mainstream \nfood products such as mashed potatoes, powdered milk, soups, and beverages, Cadbury ran the risk \nof losing its more specific meaning as a chocolate and candy brand.70\nBrand dilution  occurs when consumers no longer associate a brand with a specific or highly \nsimilar set of products and start thinking less of the brand. Porsche found sales success with its Cayenne \nsport utility vehicle and Panamera four-door sedan, which accounted for three-quarters of its vehicle \nsales in 2012, but some critics felt the company was watering down its sports car image in the process. \nPorsche subsequently dialed up its on- and off-road test tracks, driving courses, and roadshow events \nto help customers get the adrenaline rush of driving a legendary Porsche 911.\nIf a firm launches extensions that consumers deem inappropriate, they may question the integrity of \nthe brand or become confused or even frustrated: Which version of the product is \u201cthe right one\u201d for them? \nDo they know the brand as well as they thought they did? Retailers reject many new products and brands \nbecause they don\u2019t have the shelf or display space for them. And the firm itself may become overwhelmed.\nEven if sales of a brand extension are high and meet targets, the revenue may be coming from \nconsumers switching to the extension from existing parent-brand offerings\u2014in effect cannibalizing \nthe parent brand. Within-brand shifts in sales may not necessarily be undesirable if they\u2019re a form \nof preemptive cannibalization. In other words, consumers who switched to a line extension might \n otherwise have switched to a competing brand instead. Tide laundry detergent maintains the same \nmarket share it had 50 years ago because of the sales contributions of its various line extensions\u2014\nscented and unscented powder, pods, liquid, and other forms.\nOne easily overlooked disadvantage of brand extensions is that the firm forgoes the chance to \ncreate a new brand with its own unique image and equity. Consider the long-term financial advantages \nto Disney of having introduced more grown-up Touchstone films, to Levi\u2019s of creating casual Dockers \npants, and to Black & Decker of introducing high-end DeWalt power tools.\nMANAGING A BRAND CRISIS\nMarketing managers must assume a brand crisis will someday arise. Chick-fil-A, BP, Domino\u2019s, \nand Toyota have all experienced damaging\u2014and even potentially crippling\u2014brand crises. Bank of \n America, JPMorgan, AIG, and other financial services firms have been rocked by scandals that sig -\nnificantly eroded investor trust. Repercussions include lost sales, reduced effectiveness of market -\ning activities, increased sensitivity to rivals\u2019 marketing activities, and reduced impact of the firm\u2019s \nmarketing activities on competing brands. To protect the brand, key executives and sometimes even \ncompany founders might have to step down.71\nIn general, the stronger the brand and corporate image\u2014especially for credibility and \n trustworthiness\u2014the more likely the firm can weather the storm. Careful preparation and a well-\nmanaged crisis management program are also critical, however. As Johnson & Johnson\u2019s legendary \nand nearly flawless handling of the Tylenol product-tampering incident taught marketers everywhere, \nconsumers must see the firm\u2019s response as both swift  and sincere . They must immediately sense that the \ncompany truly cares.\nThe longer the firm takes to respond, the more likely consumers are to form negative impressions \nfrom unfavorable media coverage or word of mouth. Perhaps worse, they may find they don\u2019t like the \nbrand after all and permanently switch. Getting in front of a problem with public relations, and perhaps \neven ads, can help avoid those problems.72\nA classic example is Perrier\u2014the one-time brand leader in the bottled water category.

External crises such as economic recessions, \nnatural disasters, and major geopolitical events can threaten the brand and require an appropriate \nbrand response. For example, during the difficulties precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, many \norganizations looked to their marketers to retain customers and sustain brands. Marketing spending as \na share of revenue rose to an all-time high of 11.4 percent in May 2020, up from 8.6 percent only four \nmonths earlier and topping the previous high of 9.3 percent six years previously.74 Brand marketers \nwere challenged like never before by this global predicament. The best marketers responded quickly \nand took bold action to protect brand health and customer loyalty. Consider Nike\u2019s response:\nNike  Based on prevailing market conditions and factors, Nike implemented a four-phase \nglobal response to Covid-19: Containment, Recovery, Normalization, and Return to Growth. \nThe company used its innovation and marketing teams to help in the development of Personal \nProtective Equipment (PPE) for frontline doctors, nurses, and medical workers. It also reassured \nstaff and employees that there would be pay continuity despite the closing of many of its retail \noutlets. For consumers, Nike launched an engaging \u201cPlay Inside\u201d digital campaign, encouraging \npeople to stay healthy and active while they sheltered at home. The firm also offered consumers \nthe premium component of its popular exercise app free for 90 days. Continuing a selling shift \nthat had been building in previous years, Nike drove even more of its business online with a \nproprietary e-commerce app.75\nThe pandemic forced all brands to rethink what and how they were selling. Already important, \ndigital marketing became even more so. Social media as a percentage of the marketing budget rose \nfrom 13 percent in January 2020 to 23 percent in May 2020. Successful firms, however, employed a \nwell-rounded digital strategy that also emphasized websites, apps, and e-commerce options. As sales \nrose for home-related products, some brands enjoyed unprecedented demand and growth.

This includes brand \nidentifiers such as names, logos, symbols, and packaging, as well as brand associations such as \npersonalities, events, countries, and other entities.\nOne trend for luxury brands is to wrap personal experiences around the products. Top-end fash -\nion retailers are offering such experiences alongside their wares, expecting that customers who have \nvisited a workshop or met the designer will feel closer to the brand.

Some fashion brands have gone beyond \nglossy magazine spreads to listening to and communicating with consumers through  Facebook, \n Twitter, Instagram, WeChat, and other digital and social media channels.

Sites such as Net-a-Porter (now Yoox Net-a-Porter), Gilt Groupe, and \nFarfetch now offer new ways for fashion brands to move high-end goods.\nUltimately, luxury marketers are learning that success for them, and indeed for all marketers, \ndepends on getting the right balance of classic and contemporary imagery, and of continuity and \nchange, in marketing programs and activities.\nGiven the lengths to which they go to pamper customers in their stores\u2014with doormen, glasses \nof champagne, and extravagant surroundings\u2014luxury brands have had to work hard to provide a \nhigh-quality digital experience.

The hallmark of \nan optimal brand portfolio is the ability of each brand \nto maximize equity in combination with all the other \nbrands in the portfolio. Three general brand-portfolio \nstrategies are house-of-brands, branded-house, and sub-\nbranding strategies.\n7. Marketers often combine their brands with brands \nfrom other companies to create superior market \nvalue. Cobranding involves two or more brands mar -\nketed together. Ingredient branding is a special case of \ncobranding involving materials, components, or parts \nthat are necessarily contained within other branded \nproducts.\n8. Brands evolve over time. The two most common ways \nin which brands evolve are through brand reposition -\ning and through brand extensions. Brand repositioning \ninvolves changing the meaning of an existing brand \nwithout necessarily associating it with new products or \nservices. In contrast, brand extension involves using an \nestablished brand to introduce a new product in a differ -\nent category or price tier.\n9.

A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design, or some \ncombination of these elements that is intended to iden -\ntify the goods and services of one seller or group of \nsellers and to differentiate them from those of competi -\ntors. The ultimate purpose of the brand is to create, for \nconsumers, the company, and its collaborators, value \nthat goes beyond the value created by the product and \nservice aspects of the offering.\n2. Brands are valuable intangible assets that offer a number \nof benefits to customers and firms and that need to be \nmanaged carefully.\n3. The value created by a brand is captured by two key \nconcepts: brand equity and brand power. Brand equity \nreflects the premium that is placed on a company\u2019s valu -\nation because of its ownership of the brand. It encom -\npasses the net present value of the total financial returns \nthat the brand will generate over its lifetime. Brand \npower reflects the degree to which the brand influences \nthe way consumers think, feel, and act with respect to \nthe brand. It is thus the differential effect that brand \nknowledge has on consumer response to the marketing \nof that product or service.\n4. Brand elements are devices that identify and differenti -\nate the brand. Common brand elements include brand \nnames, logos, symbols, mottos, and packaging. Effective \nbrand elements are memorable, meaningful, likable, \ntransferable, adaptable, and protectable.\n5. To build strong brands, marketers link brands to other \ninformation in memory that conveys meaning to con -\nsumers. These \u201csecondary\u201d brand associations link the \nbrand to sources such as the company itself, to countries \nor other geographic regions, and to channels of distribu -\ntion, as well as to other brands, characters, spokespeople, \nsporting or cultural events, or other third-party sources.marketing insight  (continued  )", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4610, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69de808f-59ea-4e1c-b8f7-ac66fb5583e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "69de808f-59ea-4e1c-b8f7-ac66fb5583e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4f9aa82-cd21-4d54-80ac-1cd929c47a8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "428102bf8e7d301f0c2d3f6c6920734b44f9d4448ee493ab04cf080edc1b70e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aba93e76-8eeb-41e7-a86f-68948e4d0bc8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "data/Chap10.pdf"}, "hash": "4f4d67bb934efe7dd4f43f911def9033ede1971eef5f6c14c7e3fc4843a699b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef4c81b2-f693-4b7f-992f-ee64ac02f6e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "551c66741cd9b5077ae8e5832ff41bb2b2e38b0845b9a55ea067f4a648174870", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 10    |  BUILDING  STRoNG BRANDS  235\nmarketing\nSPoTLIGHT\nexpanded its product line to include male suitcases and wal-\nlets shortly after.\nThe luxury status and financial success of Louis Vuitton \nthroughout the 20th century caught the eye of businessman \nBernard Arnault who, through a series of mergers and acqui-\nsitions turned it into the world\u2019s most valuable luxury goods \ncompany.

When Louis Vuitton goods fail to sell, the company \ndiscontinues the item line. Excess inventory is burned to stop \nproducts from being stolen or sold at a lower price. Prices are \nkept high because customers are willing to pay a premium for \nthe status associated with owning a Louis Vuitton product.\nLouis Vuitton is also careful not to dilute its brand \nthrough excessive communications. This presents the com-\npany with the challenge of trying to sell as much as possible, \nwhile maintaining an aura of exclusivity and luxury.

The legendary LV monogram appears on \nall its products, whether luggage, a handbag, or a belt. By \nmodifying its product line to fit the needs of its elite custom-\ners while preserving its iconic designs, Louis Vuitton has \ncontinued offering products that are synonymous with luxury, \nwealth, and fashion.84Questions\n1.

Second, \nMUJI streamlines its manufacturing process; products typi -\ncally use natural or unfinished materials that don\u2019t have to \nbe painted or dyed. This not only makes MUJI products \nuniform in color and material but also creates less waste \nand reduces costs. Third, MUJI uses bulk packaging for its \nproducts, placing them in plain containers. Besides being \nin line with MUJI\u2019s \u201cbrandless\u201d philosophy, the minimalist \npackaging saves resources and keeps the company envi -\nronmentally friendly.\nMUJI\u2019s \u201cno brand\u201d philosophy can also be seen in its \npromotional strategy. The company keeps its advertising \nbudget modest by relying on word of mouth to spread aware-\nness. Instead of running huge advertising campaigns on \nTV and print media, MUJI prefers to reach people through \npress and in-store events. Resources are invested in the \nsalespeople employed in its physical locations. Locally hired \nstore managers are sent to MUJI offices in Tokyo for training \non how to sell MUJI products. By ensuring that customers MUJI\nMUJI was founded in 1980 as a private label for Japanese \nsupermarket The Seiyu. At the time, foreign brands were \nbecoming increasingly popular as the economy grew. As a \nresult, cheaper, low-quality imitation goods became attractive \nalternatives for budget-conscious consumers. MUJI goods \nwere created to fill the growing market for quality goods \nthat were affordable and long-lasting. MUJI started with 9 \nhousehold and 31 food products, which were advertised \nwith the slogan \u201clower priced for a reason.\u201d Products were \npackaged in simple materials such as clear cellophane and \nbrown paper. over the next couple of years, MUJI expanded \nits product line to include stationery, clothing, kitchen appli-\nances, and home furnishings. It also began opening its own \nstores across Japan.\nThe company\u2019s full name, Mujirushi Ryohin, means  \n\u201cno-brand quality goods,\u201d a design philosophy that reflects \nthe simplicity and functionality of its products. MUJI claims \nthat its products are \u201cbrandless,\u201d which means that they do \nnot have logos or distinct markings. They are designed not to \nstand out, but rather to look minimalist\u2014as MUJI describes \nthem, to be just \u201cenough\u201d to deliver the one function they \nwere designed for. This can be seen in MUJI socks, which \nare made with a 90-degree angle rather than the normal 120. \nThe right angle helps with heel slippage when the socks \nare worn inside boots and increases overall comfort. MUJI \nintends its products to be simple in both function and style, \nso they can be mixed and matched to suit any user\u2019s needs \nand lifestyle.\nMUJI follows three core principles to create quality, \nminimalist products that anyone can afford. First, MUJI \ncarefully selects the materials used to manufacture its \nproducts. The company has been known to use industrial \nmaterials that it can buy in bulk at low cost.

Even though the company offers \nover 7,000\u00a0items, MUJI does not customize its products for \nparticular countries and regions.
