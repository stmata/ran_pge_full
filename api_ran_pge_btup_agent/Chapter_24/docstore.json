In order to\nserve consumers actual needs and wants regarding organic products, those involved in the market need\nto be informed about consumers\u2019 perception of organic products. Therefore, the state of research asregards consumers\u2019 perception of organic product characteristics, including basic and additional charac-\nteristics, product labelling, product innovations and the range of products on the market is displayed in\nthis contribution. A comprehensive literature analysis was performed uncovering not only the state of theart in the \ufb01eld including employed methodology, but also research needs. Most studies are published onconsumers\u2019 perception of organic products\u2019 design and labelling. A trend towards the so called \u2018organic-\nplus\u2019 positioning can be perceived, with many consumers expecting an extensive orientation towards\nsustainability. The diversity of product labels features prominently in related studies. The demand forreliable information, as well as the low degree of awareness of many labels amongst consumers becomes\nclear in these studies. To date, few results are available on consumers\u2019 perception of packaging and design\nof organic products, and even fewer for consumers\u2019 perception of range design. Both consumers\u2019 percep-tion of organic product innovation and valued added services are untouched so far.\n/C2112013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, organic products, which are\nhere understood as organic foods which are certi\ufb01ed as organic\naccording to EU Regulation 834/2007 can be found in most food\nshops in Western European countries and the USA. In conventional\nsupermarkets and discount stores, organic products need to com-\npete with conventional products and their quality attributes. Con-\nventional retail products are jumping onto the bandwagon of\nsustainable consumption in the broadest sense, recognizing a\nbroad range of issues, such as animal welfare, freedom from genet-\nically modi\ufb01ed organisms (GMOs), rejection of additives and\nreduction of carbon footprint (see Warschun et al., 2009 ). Hand\nin hand with these market developments, organic products are\nbecoming more diversi\ufb01ed and there is growing consumer interest\nin more than just the \u2018organic quality\u2019 attribute. Ethical consider-\nations are increasingly signi\ufb01cant, but animal welfare, local origin\nand genetic modi\ufb01cations also play a role in the organic productdecision, on top of the core organic product attributes (see Honka-\nnen, Verplanken, & Olsen, 2006; Zander & Hamm, 2010 ).\nThe aim of this paper is to gather the present state of knowledge\non the subject of consumers\u2019 perception of organic product charac-\nteristics. In order to serve consumers\u2019 needs and wants, it is crucial\nthat those involved in the market are informed in as much detail as\npossible about the perception of organic foods, especially since or-\nganic products have left their market niche (see Hughner, McDon-\nagh, Prothero, Shultz, & Stanton, 2007 ). Over the past few years,\nvarious studies focusing on individual aspects of organic consump-\ntion have been published. Currently, the only comprehensive liter-\nature review on organic consumption deals with personal\ndeterminants of organic food consumption ( Aertsens, Verbeke,\nMondelaers, & van Huylenbroeck, 2009 ). A comprehensive over-\nview over consumers\u2019 perception of organic product characteristics\ndoes not exist to date. The present contribution, therefore, gives an\noverview of the state of research on the topic, including basic and\nadditional characteristics, product labelling, product innovations\nand the range of products on the market.\nThe paper is structured as follows.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a971389-3dc7-439f-99d3-174eb89220f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a971389-3dc7-439f-99d3-174eb89220f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "420", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac7b2122-3ca3-44a8-964f-e340e56607b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "420", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "1da67aa565668654c3fd712fe543a07258c9fd5a852e9d29c432b775a44ede01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "312abdcd-138a-47ce-839c-1afdf2b9bef2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "420", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "aca2e4df5b31aeab1dde41f3fca87193c2bf236cb6e2aeba2624a72e8abbcb6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29c4d840-0b44-440b-8353-8a91a696f740", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f61b095c6f136e7d6ba2fb3a5291aa77015a4e1183a7fb5423c7f946539df2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Over the past few years,\nvarious studies focusing on individual aspects of organic consump-\ntion have been published.

The last part of the paper puts for-\nward conclusions and suggestions for further areas of research.\nTheoretical background\nIn current marketing literature, a product is de\ufb01ned as a bun-\ndle of characteristics of bene\ufb01t to the consumer ( Pickton & Mast-\nerson, 2010 ). In order to encompass the complexity of\ncharacteristics offered by the product as a whole, it can be subdi-\nvided into three different dimensions, relating to the core value of\nthe product, the actual product and the augmented product, see\nFig. 1 .\nThe core product includes the basic product value, which is\nunderstood to represent the main characteristics of a product\n(Pickton & Masterson, 2010; Strydom, 2007 ). However, product\ncharacteristics go far beyond the basic value only, and the core\nbene\ufb01ts of a product need to be turned into an actual product.\nProduct quality, packaging and design of the product (including\nlabelling) and the brand identity are all attributes that account\nfor the actual product ( Armstrong & Kotler, 2009 ). The augmented\nproduct is built around the actual product values. Product support\nservices (such as warranty, after sales service and product support)\nare also addressed here ( Armstrong & Kotler, 2009 ).\nThe product quality \u2013 referred to as product design in the fol-\nlowing illustration \u2013 of organic food products can be subdivided\ninto the categories of nutrition, health, sensory properties and or-\nganic properties,1according to Beck et al. (2012) . In the following,\norganic properties are referred to as \u2018ethical properties\u2019. Although\nthis term includes the organic attributes of a product, it also includes\nfurther ethical attributes, such as Fair Trade or animal welfare.\nThe basic value of the product quality consists of nutrition and\nhealth attributes. Sensory properties and ethical properties can bereferred to as the added value (see Beck et al., 2012; B\u00f6ckenhoff &\nHamm, 1983 ), as shown in Fig. 2 .\nThe sensory properties describe important quality criteria in or-\nganic foods ( Beck et al., 2012 ) and comprise shape, colour, taste,\nsmell and texture. Sensory characteristics can be classi\ufb01ed as he-\ndonic characteristics, alongside aspects of nutrition and health\n(Bruns\u00f8, Fjord, & Grunert, 2002 ). Ethical properties are also re-\nferred to as the intangible value of an organic product ( B\u00f6ckenhoff\n& Hamm, 1983 ), and can be understood as the \u2018image impact\u2019 of\nthe product on consumers. Attributes of product quality can be as-\nsigned to both the basic and the added product value.\nProducts are further characterized by the distinction between\nsearch, experience and credence characteristics. The latter is espe-\ncially important for organic products since the ethical property\ncharacteristic of \u2018production method\u2019 is also a credence character-\nistic, in the sense that the \ufb01nal consumer is unable to verify\nwhether the product is produced organically or not. The same\nholds for health characteristics. Experience characteristics are\nproduct attributes, such as taste, which can only be ascertained\nafter experiencing the product. Search characteristics, for example\nthe appearance of a food product, can be experienced prior to pur-\nchase ( Grunert, Bredahl, & Bruns\u00f8, 2004 ).\nMethodology and overview of the studies\nA comprehensive literature search was performed in order to\nidentify the current state of the art as regards consumer purchas-\ning behaviour in general (see Hamm et al., 2011 ). The literature\nwhich serves as a basis for this paper aims at re\ufb02ecting the cur-rent state of research into product policy \u2013 to the extent relevant\nto the examination of consumers\u2019 purchasing and consumption\nbehaviour, and was published in the English or German language.\nStudies that deal with business management perspectives were\nnot included.

Further,\nnon-empirical studies were excluded as well. Some studies were\nassociated with more than one of the subtopics and thus appear\nin different sections.\nIn total, 48 studies concerning the product, policy-related issues\nof consumer perception regarding organic foods were analyzed for\nthis investigation. Table 2 gives an overview of the number of stud-\nies per subtopic and the major countries of origin, as well as the fo-\ncus subjects of investigation. It illustrates that two signi\ufb01cant\nresearch themes were identi\ufb01ed: consumers\u2019 demand with respect\nto product design \ufb01rstly and secondly, product labelling. The prod-\nuct range, which implies consumers\u2019 needs as regards the actualrange of organic products, emerges as a subtopic which has been\nexamined rather less. Consumers\u2019 opinions on packaging design\nand on product innovation have been hardly touched by research\nuntil now.\nProduct design\nThis section examines the state of scienti\ufb01c knowledge as re-\ngards consumers\u2019 expectations and the design or quality criteria\nof organic products. The results are presented according to the the-\noretical background and classi\ufb01cation of product quality described\nin Methodology and overview of the studies. Most studies consid-\nered \u2018typical\u2019 organic products in everyday use, so as to produce re-\nsults that could be generalized, but there were exceptions, such as\nthe speci\ufb01c studies on meat, salmon and organic plus products. No\nstudies could be found on consumers\u2019 attitudes towards new or\nchanged products or on consumer behaviour as regards product\nelimination.\nMethodology and sample\nEleven publications treated the subject exclusively with quanti-\ntative methods. Most publications applied interviews: face-to-faceinterviews, written interviews or computer-assisted personal or\ntelephone interviews. Experimental conjoint analysis, sensory testsand the information display matrix method have also been used.\nEight of the 11 quantitative surveys had a sample size greater than\n500. Four of these publications utilized well-founded sampling\nmethods, such as systematic samples, quota samples or random\nsampling. However, sampling methodology is unclear in some of\nthese publications. Often, a convenience sample was used. One\npublication was compiled on the basis of quantitative as well as\nqualitative methods. Here, sensory tests and Vickrey auctions were\ncombined with focus group discussions. Ten publications about\nproduct design approached the subject qualitatively, mainlythrough group discussions. Qualitative approaches are very suit-\nable for obtaining \ufb01rst insights into consumer expectations. Since\nabout half of the publications are based on qualitative research,\nproducing exploratory insights, this \ufb01rst step is done and now\nquantitative research should follow to validate the \ufb01rst insights\ninto the topic.\nResults\nFirst of all, it is striking that most studies looked at the general-\nities of consumers\u2019 perception towards product characteristics.\nThus, they did not go into depth, or question the precise nature\nof consumers\u2019 quality perception with regard to sensory, health,\nnutrition and ethical properties. Additionally, it should be noted\nthat few studies dealt with consumer expectations as the central\nquestion of research. Thus, the central \ufb01ndings on product design\nare drawn from the studies. Studies\u2019 results on how the attributes\nof organic products are perceived share \ufb01ndings in many points.\nSeveral studies found that health and sensory properties are\nimportant product characteristics. In focus group discussions\nundertaken in Australia with both organic and non-organic\nconsumers, Chang and Zepeda (2005) found that sensory parame-\nters, such as taste, \ufb02avour, texture, smell and look, are the mostTable 1\nSubtopics and contents including search terms.\nSubtopics Contents Search terms\nProduct design Consumer demands concerning an organic product Product character/consistency, product quality\nConsumer attitudes towards new or changed products/consumer behaviourconcerning product elimination\nPackaging design Consumer demands concerning packaging design Product packaging, package, product styling, package size, product\nappearance, product colour\nProduct labelling Consumer attitudes and behaviour towards labelling Label, labelling, brand, product brandProduct range Consumer demands concerning product range Product range, product line, product assortment\nProduct support\nservicesConsumer demands towards product support services such as guarantee and\ncustomer serviceProduct guaranty/warranty/service\nTable 2\nStudy overview.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b1f073a-24ed-4af1-beec-3e352a9d1796": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b1f073a-24ed-4af1-beec-3e352a9d1796", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "422", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9033961e-9ff9-4b96-933a-e591a767d2c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "422", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "4a05209eadb1e73cef2bdf79c79a3cefdcda6c7e7f4eb1492fd8fe64500eab56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0953959-91a9-4777-84b4-102cca6aa964", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "422", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "fa9a57482a16198bf9b1a951d63456c58925e3ee47d847ab0436b2991147d20d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "680a1b03-fbb8-4f50-9c3b-e2786af4d25b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4230c4479cdf627719c9aecf26bcff9fba0ee7b68a62d7bead47885959e29e99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In focus group discussions\nundertaken in Australia with both organic and non-organic\nconsumers, Chang and Zepeda (2005) found that sensory parame-\nters, such as taste, \ufb02avour, texture, smell and look, are the mostTable 1\nSubtopics and contents including search terms.\nSubtopics Contents Search terms\nProduct design Consumer demands concerning an organic product Product character/consistency, product quality\nConsumer attitudes towards new or changed products/consumer behaviourconcerning product elimination\nPackaging design Consumer demands concerning packaging design Product packaging, package, product styling, package size, product\nappearance, product colour\nProduct labelling Consumer attitudes and behaviour towards labelling Label, labelling, brand, product brandProduct range Consumer demands concerning product range Product range, product line, product assortment\nProduct support\nservicesConsumer demands towards product support services such as guarantee and\ncustomer serviceProduct guaranty/warranty/service\nTable 2\nStudy overview.\nSubtopics Number of studies Countries Subjects of investigationa\nProduct design 22 Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic,\nGreece, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,UK, USAOrganic foodstuffs in general, speci\ufb01c groups of products\n(e.g. meat and wine), foodstuffs with product-spanningcharacteristics and consumer expectations of theseproducts, organic plus products, functional food, foodmiles, organic product innovations\nPackaging design 2 UK, Germany, Switzerland Organic foods in general, speci\ufb01c products (\ufb01sh and\nmilk)\nProduct labelling 21 Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,\nItaly, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, USAOrganic labels and special claims (e.g. health claims),\nmanufacturer brands or retail brands and theirperception by consumers\nProduct range 3 Germany, Sweden Organic food range in generalProduct support services 0 \u2013 \u2013\naOrdered according to frequency of appearance.422 R.

Organic consumers\nalso incorporate further criteria in the food choice process, relating\nto personal health, environmental concerns, animal welfare and\nthe protection of small farms and rural communities. These \ufb01nd-\nings can be supported, in part, by Magnusson, Arvola, Hursti,\n\u00c5berg, and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n (2001) who interviewed 1154 Swedish consum-\ners using a written questionnaire. They also found that taste and\nhealth are the two most important purchase criteria for organic\nproducts, further important aspects being long shelf-life and the\ncore quality of the product. Zanoli and Naspetti (2002) , who per-\nformed an exploratory laddering approach with 60 consumers in\nItaly, identi\ufb01ed that consumers associate taste and health with or-\nganic products. Furthermore, they noted that organic products\nwere generally perceived to be \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 and nourishing. Interest-ingly, in both the latter studies, ethical attributes such as animal\nwelfare or environmental \u2018friendliness\u2019 were not mentioned. Other\nstudies found the health aspect to be most prominent: in a study\nbased on focus group discussions, Stolz and Schmid (2008) found\nthat organic wine is expected to be healthier than conventional\nwine. When interviewing 23 organic consumers qualitatively in\nChina, Sirieix, Kledal, and Sulitang (2011) were also able to identify\nhealth as an important purchase criterion. The importance of envi-\nronmental friendliness found by, for example, Chang and Zepeda\n(2005) was also detected by Sirieix et al. (2011) . Health factors\nand environmental friendliness are also shown to be the main rea-\nsons for buying organic products in Thailand ( Sangkumchaliang &\nHuang, 2012 ). As an example of organic product perception in\nEuropean post-socialist countries, Zagata (2012) discovered that,\nfor Czech consumers, health beliefs and quality attributes are most\nprominent when purchasing organic products. They showed that\nenvironmental issues and the development of sustainable rural\nareas or local foods appeared to be less signi\ufb01cant.\nThe results of Aarset et al. (2004) , in their examination of 196\nconsumers from \ufb01ve different European countries using focus\ngroup discussions, are slightly different from the \ufb01ndings summa-\nrized above. Using the exploratory methodology of associations,\nthey revealed that consumers mainly expect organic food to be\n\u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019; a term which, in generalizing to such an extent, had\nnot been evident in any of the studies mentioned previously. How-\never, in line with other publications, the expectation of environ-\nmental friendliness was often mentioned by participants. When\nexamining the differences between countries, Aarset et al. (2004)\ndiscovered that animal welfare was only mentioned by the German\nparticipants, whereas refraining from pesticide use was mentioned\nonly by Spanish participants. Further associations were limited hu-\nman intervention (France) and freedom from arti\ufb01cial ingredients\n(not further speci\ufb01ed) in the UK, both of which were not men-tioned elsewhere.\nThe topic of the absence of chemical residues or the avoidance\nof pesticide application was examined in detail by Tsakiridou, Bou-\ntsouki, Zotos, and Mattas (2008) . They found that, from written\ninterviews with 660 consumers, Greek consumers expect organic\nproducts to be free from chemical residues. This aspect is also ad-\ndressed by Aarset et al.

Interestingly, the authors\nexplained that, even though both private and public good attri-\nbutes are mentioned by consumers as being important to them,\nit is the attributes of private goods, like health (including foodsafety) and quality (such as taste and freshness), that are relevant\nto the purchase decision. Conversely, public good attributes like\nenvironmental and animal welfare are acknowledged widely, but\nnot relevant to the purchase decision. In their analyses of panel\ndata from the UK and Denmark, with a total of 17,000 consumers,\nthe authors found that, even though public goods were rated as\nmore important, it is the private good attributes that make con-\nsumers purchase organic foods. Wier, Andersen, Millock, O\u2019Doherty\nJensen, and Rosenkvist (2005) further explained that one quarter of\nthe Danish and British consumers interviewed believe that organic\nproducts lower the risk of bacterial contamination and \u2018Mad Cow\u2019\ndisease. This shows that organic products are perceived as ensur-\ning enhanced food safety, even in relation to food safety risks that\nare not directly controlled through organic farming regulations.\nBoth Freyer (2007) , in his examination of organic consumers in\nAustria, and Cran\ufb01eld et al. (2009) incorporate origin of the prod-\nuctin their studies. Freyer showed that Austrian organic consum-\ners pay considerable attention to this aspect. From in-depth\ninterviews with 38 organic consumers, he discovered that consum-\ners prefer conventional products from their own localities to or-\nganic products from further away. In line with these \ufb01ndings,\nCran\ufb01eld et al.

Pesticide stan-\ndards, including regular testing, are also important to consumers,\nas noted by other authors (e.g. Aarset, et al. 2004; Hill & Lynchh-\naun, 2002 ).\nIn focus group discussions with 89 participants, regarding the\nspeci\ufb01c case of meat ,Heid, Brenninkmeyer, Knierim, and Hamm\n(2011) explored organic consumers\u2019 attitudes towards pig meat\nfrom piglets which were castrated without anaesthesia. They\nestablished that animal protection, consumer health, food security\nand taste, as well as costs, are all important product characteristics\nwhen purchasing organic meat. McEachern and Schr\u00f6der (2001)\nalso focused on meat consumption. They surveyed 30 female or-\nganic consumers in the UK by means of qualitative interviews.\nThey identi\ufb01ed product appearance as an important selection cri-\nterion for meat and, in a similar \ufb01nding to that of Heid et al.\n(2011) , they also showed that cost is an import product character-\nistic.

Also,\nHoefkens, Verbeke, Aertsens, Mondelaers, and Camp (2009) com-\npared organic and conventional products in a written question-\nnaire with 529 consumers. They concluded that consumers in the\nNetherlands, like those surveyed in the UK market by Hill and\nLynchhaun (2002) , perceive organic vegetables to be less contam-\ninated and more nutritious compared to conventional ones and,\nthereby, healthier and safer in terms of product quality. The\nauthors showed that the higher the buying frequency, the higher\nis this perception, independent of socio-demographics.

He found that politically/ethically-minded consumers\napply \u2018re\ufb02exive\u2019 practices when purchasing organic food. For these\nconsumers, this implies that health considerations, ethical consid-\nerations (like animal welfare), political considerations (such as\nenvironmentalism) and quality considerations (like taste) play an\nimportant role. These consumers integrate both public and private\ngood attributes into their product claims. The pragmatic shoppers\nrather pay attention to the availability and visibility of foods, as\nwell as the price.\nA study in the Netherlands by Stobbelaar et al.

Through written\ninterviews, they found that the aspects of environmental friendli-\nness, animal welfare and personal health already identi\ufb01ed in\nother studies were important factors for adolescents as well. Or-\nganic food was perceived as tasty, though not as cheap, by half of\nthe pupils. Girls had a more positive attitude towards the quality\nof organic food than boys.\nStolz et al. (2009) was found to be the only study that closely\nexamined consumers\u2019 product criteria characteristics, and looked\nat consumers\u2019 expectations of product quality in detail. Their re-\nsearch focused on \ufb01ve different products: apples, eggs, tomatoes,\nyoghurt and bread. They conducted 11 focus group discussions in\nGermany and Switzerland. In the case of yoghurt, they found that\nfat content is the most important quality criterion. Some consum-\ners complained that organic, fat-reduced yoghurt was not available\nin Germany. As regards bread, consumers criticized the application\nof additives, and highlighted type of \ufb02our as the most important\nquality criterion. Generally, taste emerged as the most important\nsensory criterion for all the products examined. In addition, geo-\ngraphical origin was also considered, especially of apples (see also\nFreyer, 2007 ). Important production and processing criteria in the\ncase of apples include absence of synthetic, chemical plant protec-\ntion and cultivation in open land.\nTable 3 provides a summary of the studies analyzed for this\noverview. Clearly, sensory characteristics, health, and ethical prop-\nerties are seen to be the most important quality characteristics;\nnutritional values are hardly mentioned. Amongst the ethical prop-\nerties, environmental issues and animal welfare are most promi-\nnent.

Generally, re-sults could be better speci\ufb01ed through applying more consumer-\noriented approaches. Most studies deal with organic products in\ngeneral, or with typical products, in order to generalize results,\nbut studies of meat from (non-) castrated piglets and of salmon\nhave been exceptions.\nA major research gap arises from the fact that there is only one\nstudy ( Stolz et al., 2009 ) which actually focuses on the details of\nconsumer demand for product characteristics. However, this study\nonly offers limited insight, since identifying consumers\u2019 expecta-\ntions with regard to organic products was not the core topic of\nthe study, and only four selected product groups were analyzed.\nFurther, analysis of real organic innovation is missing from re-\nsearch studies, as is an assessment of how organic consumers gen-\nerally respond to innovative products (Variety-seeking behaviour).\nPackaging design\nIn this section, the consumers\u2019 perception of the design of or-\nganic packaging is discussed.\nMethodology and sample\nOverall, just two publications, from the UK and Germany/Swit-\nzerland, raised the subject of packaging design with regard to or-\nganic products. The study by Hill and Lynchhaun (2002) applied\nfocus group discussions consisting of only female organic consum-\ners and participants were selected at random. A further study, also\nbased on focus group discussion data, was undertaken by Stolz\net al. (2009) in Switzerland and Germany. In this case, a total of\n11 focus group discussions with organic consumers were con-\nducted, and selection of participants was based on a quota\napproach.\nResults\nHill and Lynchhaun (2002) analyzed the perception of organic\nmilk packaging and found that its appearance was regarded by\nconsumers as relatively subdued. Only one of the packages tested\nwas perceived not to be so, because of its bright and colourful de-\nsign. Consumers emphasized that it was important for them to be\nable to distinguish between organic and conventional packaging.\nStolz et al. (2009) offer more detailed insights into product packag-\ning. Generally, however, it should be noted that packaging was not\ndiscussed very extensively in their focus group discussions, high-\nlighting the lack of relevance of the topic from the consumer point\nof view. Nevertheless, due to the exploratory character of the dis-\ncussions and the nature of the study goals, some insight was\ngained into the relevance of speci\ufb01c shopping and quality criteria:\nconsumers mentioned that they dislike tomatoes which are\nwrapped in plastic; regarding yoghurt, they would like to be424 R.

Additionally, both are of exploratory nature.\nAlthough there are transferable study results associated with\nthe consumer interest in \u2018green\u2019 packaging more generally, these\ndo not focus speci\ufb01cally on organic products ( Rokka & Uusitalo,\n2008 ).

All in all, it can be concluded that, although a few\nspeci\ufb01c aspects of speci\ufb01c products have been worked on in the\ufb01eld of packaging design for organic products, there are still con-\nsiderable gaps in research. A general appraisal of how organic con-sumers react to \u2018green\u2019 packaging at different points of purchase\ncould provide a starting point for further research. Next, the reac-\ntions and expectations of consumers as regards the packaging of\nspeci\ufb01c products could be tested, since packaging is product-\nspeci\ufb01c. The design of a product is also closely related to brand\n(Ambrose & Harris, 2011 ), and could therefore also be tested at\nbrand-speci\ufb01c level.\nProduct labelling\nThis section gives an overview of publications that deal with\nconsumers\u2019 perception of labelling, including knowledge of labels\nand trust in labelling organizations.

In most cases, choice test methodology\n(including interviews), interviews or conjoint analyses were ap-\nplied. Between 122 and 40,341 participants were contacted, and\nthese were sampled mainly through convenience or quota ap-\nproaches; one study applied panel data. Five qualitative publica-\ntions based their research on focus group discussions, in depth-\ninterviews or laddering interviews. Two studies applied a combi-\nnation of qualitative and quantitative methods, the combined focus\ngroup discussions either with face-to-face interviews or choice\nexperiments.\nResults\nConsumer knowledge about labelling is crucial, not only for rec-\nognition of an organic product, but also for trust in its credence\nattributes. In this context, Janssen and Hamm (2011) showed that\nthestate of knowledge about organic certi\ufb01cation schemes is gen-\nerally poor. Many consumers do not know that a control system\nunderlies organic production, and knowledge of the differences be-\ntween types of label is generally lacking. Furthermore, consumers\u2019\nperceptions of organic labelling schemes tend to be mostly subjec-\ntive and, consequently, not based on objective knowledge ( Janssen\n& Hamm, 2012 ). For the US market, Essoussi and Zahaf (2009)\nshowed that regular organic consumers know about the labels\nand recognize the different ones available. They also found that,\nwhen buying organic foods, consumers look for certi\ufb01cation and\na label, indicating that the label is the means of identifying organic\nfoods in the store (see also Hjelmar, 2011 ) and of differentiating\nsuch foods from conventional products ( Wier, O\u2019Doherty Jensen,\n& Andersen, 2008 ).\nAs regards trust, Aarset et al. (2004) detected a lack of trust in\norganic labelling and the underlying regulations in their analysisof focus group discussions with 196 consumers from \ufb01ve European\ncountries. Their \ufb01ndings suggested that there is mistrust of govern-\nment regulations in the UK, Germany and Norway, the exceptions\nbeing France and Spain.\nComplementary \ufb01ndings are presented by Sonderskov and\nDaugbjerg (2011) who examine the question of what makes an\neco-label trustworthy . They found that trust in different organic\nlabelling schemes is greatest where there is substantial state\ninvolvement. Consumers are more likely to trust labelling schemes\nwhere the state plays an active and visible role. In their Computer-\nAssisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) and choice experiments with\n1000 consumers in UK, the USA, Denmark and Sweden, they found\nthat citizens who are con\ufb01dent in governmental institutions are\nalso con\ufb01dent with the labelling scheme. This also applies in coun-\ntries where no governmental labelling takes place. Therefore, in\ncountries where consumers do not trust state institutions, consum-\ners\u2019 trust in labelling cannot be increased by relying on a non-state\nlabel. More speci\ufb01cally, they showed that in the USA2and the UK,\nconsumers tend to rather trust organic labelling or are unsure. Nev-\nertheless, a notable proportion of consumers in both countries re-\nmain mistrustful of organic labelling. Trust in such labelling was\nshown to be greatest in Sweden and Denmark. The latter conclusion\nis supported by the \ufb01ndings of Hjelmar (2011) who reported that\nmost of the respondents in his study, which was based on in-depth\ninterviews with 16 Danish consumers, showed a general trust in eco-\nlabels. He identi\ufb01ed the key role of labels in creating trust in organicproducts.

Janssen and Hamm\n(2011) , in a study based on focus group discussions with 218 or-\nganic consumers from \ufb01ve different European countries, lookedat the question of which labels consumers prefer when they have\na choice, as is the case in various countries. They explain that some\nconsumers prefer certain labelling schemes because they perceive\nthem as having stricter standards than the EU label, for example, in\nthe case of some farmers\u2019 association standards in Germany and\nthe governmental label in Denmark. However, as has already been\nshown, information about the differences between standards is not\nalways given. For the label owners, this means that there is a need\nto communicate the underlying criteria on which standards are\nbased. This could provide certi\ufb01cation schemes with a strategy\nfor differentiating their labels from the mandatory EU logo.\nIn the Japanese market ,Kim, Suwunnamek, and Toyoda (2008)\nperformed a conjoint analysis based on data from 202 consumers.\nThey found that Japanese consumers prefer organic products\nequipped with the governmental label (JAS), rather than organic la-\nbels. The JAS label is perceived as a reliable source of quality and\nsafety certi\ufb01cation, but varying degrees of preference for private\nlabelling schemes also exist. These \ufb01ndings on the preference for\norganic products with the JAS label is not completely supported\nbySakagami, Sato, and Ueta (2006) who performed written inter-\nviews and choice experiments with 698 consumers in Kyoto, Japan.\nSakagami et al. (2006) detected a preference for the products of a\nnon-pro\ufb01t organization certi\ufb01cation scheme for vegetables that\nclaims not to use agricultural chemicals or chemical fertilizers, or\nto reduce the amounts used by at least 50%, over the federally-con-\ntrolled JAS label. They also showed that, when purchasing fresh\nvegetables, the importance of certi\ufb01cation is not as great as fresh-\nness and region of origin.\nIn an examination of the US market ,Kiesel and Villas-Boas\n(2007) undertook a survey of the consumer preference for organic\nproducts which are either labelled or not, based on panel data and\nwritten interviews. The results of this study show that if organic\nmilk is equipped with an USDA label, it increases the probabilityof purchase.

Similarly, in Germany, Maro-\nschek et al. (2008) performed face-to-face interviews combined\nwith choice experiments with 210 organic consumers, concluding\nthat purchase probabilities are signi\ufb01cantly higher if organic prod-ucts carry a health claim. This \ufb01nding accords with those of Bond\net al. (2008) . In both the organic and the conventional sectors,\nproducts carrying such claims are considered to be healthier.\nFew studies could be found on the effect of branding :Wirthgen\n(2005) analyzed the preference for organically-labelled products\nand organic brands in Germany. She identi\ufb01ed the German Bio-Sie-\ngel, a producer association label and a retail brand as being the\nthree most-purchased organic products, and was able to show that\nconsumers not only pay attention to the organic label, but also to\nthe organic retail brand. In her study, Baranek (2007) explains that\nbuilding up strong organic brands could offer substantial potential\nfor the development of the German market. Brands are able to\ncommunicate the attributes of the product demanded in a favour-\nable way, especially as they are able to help develop the consumer\ntrust that is so important for organic products (due to their cre-\ndence good characteristics). Nevertheless, a trade-off analysis be-\ntween organic labels and brands was not performed by Baranek\n(2007) . Recently, however, two studies have been published which\ninvestigate the interaction between branding and labelling in the\ncase of organic products. According to Bauer, Heinrich, and Sch\u00e4fer\n(2012) , the application of an organic label can increase the brand\nperception and add value to the brand. This study is based on in-\ndepth interviews as well as online questionnaires ( n= 630) with\nconsumers and identi\ufb01es the support given to brand differentiation\nby organic labels, especially in the case of private brands which ap-\npear to pro\ufb01t the most from an organic label. Generally, Bauer,\nHeinrich, and Sch\u00e4fer (in press) found that owners of strong brands\nshould be careful when adding an organic logo, since the organic\nattribute could outperform the brand itself. In conclusion, the\nauthors recommend that organic certi\ufb01cation is mainly appropri-\nate for private brands, or relatively weak brands. This accords with\nthe \ufb01ndings of Larceneux, Benoit-Moreau, and Renaudin (2012) :i f\nthe brand equity is high, the organic label appears less effectiveand vice versa.\nResearch gaps\nOn the subtopic of \u2018product labelling\u2019, there are various studies\nabout the labelling of organic products, but only one study dealing\nwith the obligatory EU organic label since its introduction in 2010.\nThis is a signi\ufb01cant research gap, as there has been no extensive\ndiscussion regarding the question of how consumers perceive the\nnew EU organic logo in comparison with governmental or private\norganic seals and other association marks. Further research is also\nneeded about the extent to which country of origin information\nmakes sense and acceptance of the new EU seal by consumers.\nAs regards speci\ufb01c products, no study deals with labelling percep-\ntion from a consumer point of view, and the level of research into\nthe labelling of speci\ufb01c characteristics is rather low. This has only\nbeen studied in the context of the labelling of organic plus prod-\nucts, information about the country of origin and products withhealth claims.

Recently, two studies on the co-effects of brand-\ning and organic labelling were published ( Bauer et al., 2013; Larce-\nneux et al., 2012 ). On the basis of these \ufb01ndings, further studies\ncould be conducted using enhanced survey and analysis methods.\nAt the international level, the potential for organic brands on the\nSwedish market has been examined ( Lind, 2007 ), as has consum-\ners\u2019 trust in organic retail brands ( Perrini, Castaldo, Misani, & Tenc-\nati, 2010 ). Both studies, however, are only capable of giving \ufb01rst\ninsights into these aspects, when looked at from the methodolog-\nical point of view.\nProduct range\nThere are only a very small number of studies that explicitly\ndeals with consumers\u2019 expectations about retailers\u2019 assortment,\nin terms of organic food product lines, or perceived gaps in the\nrange on offer. Whereas there are scores of studies dealing with\nconsumers\u2019 attitudes towards speci\ufb01c organic products (see Prod-\nuct design), thus implicitly addressing the question of whether a\nproduct should be integrated into the assortment or not, consum-\ners\u2019 perception of the range, as such, is hardly addressed.\nMethodology and sample\nIn their study, Buder and Hamm (2011) used computer-based\npersonal interviews with 817 organic consumers in 16 points of\nsale distributed all over Germany. Gaps in the product range avail-\nable in different food retail shops in the organic \ufb01eld were specif-\nically identi\ufb01ed. Spiller, L\u00fcth, and Enneking (2004) applied the\nLaddering technique to a qualitative survey of 32 consumers, and\napplied choice experiments with 1150 consumers in Germany. Fur-\nther, they performed 12 expert interviews with retailers, traders,processors and producers. L\u00fcth, Spiller, and Enneking (2005) ap-\nplied choice experiments in the case of 1080 respondents who\nwere interviewed face-to-face and computer-assisted.\nResults\nBuder and Hamm (2011) found that consumers perceive gaps in\nproduct assortments: the results of their study showed that con-\nsumers demand a broader range with regard to frozen pizza,\ncheese, convenience desserts, margarine and sweets. This corre-\nsponds with the general \ufb01ndings of Spiller et al. (2004) who noted\nthat organic consumers also demand convenience products. How-\never, the perception of organic consumers is that the visual and\nsensory qualities of organic convenience products are not without\nproblems. L\u00fcth et al. (2005) suggested that \u2018\u2018health and physical\n\ufb01tness are current trends that might be combined with organic\nfood\u2019\u2019, as well as combinations of organic with local origin (which,\nnowadays, is already integrated into the market). They further\nemphasize the importance of chilled or functional food and recom-\nmend expanding the organic product range by innovative and\nimaginative products, in line with Spiller et al.

Interna-\ntional studies could focus both on the range demands, as well as\nthe speci\ufb01c assessment of consumers\u2019 demands regarding product\nassortments in the different retail outlets. Another question, which\nMagnusson et al. (2001) touched on for the Swedish market, is\nwhether organic products are easy to \ufb01nd and identify. As a general\nstatement, they found that availability is limited, but that there are\nno major obstacles in \ufb01nding these products. However, their re-\nsults are from 2001 and may have become outdated due to rapid\nmarket development. Furthermore, their results hold for Sweden\nonly. Another question that also remains unaddressed to date is\nthat of the position of organic products in supermarkets; whether\nconsumers prefer them to be integrated, or displayed separately on\nextra shelving for organic products.\nProduct support services\nNo studies about product support services for organic food\nproducts \u2013 such as product guarantee and customer services \u2013\ncould be found. This is surprising, since such services might help\nto reverse a lack of demand and simplify or increase the comfort\nuse of products. For example, studies on the effect of \u2018taste guaran-\ntees\u2019 do not exist. Taste guarantees imply that consumers are\nremunerated the product price if they are not satis\ufb01ed with the\nproduct quality in order to reduce their barrier to try an organic\nproduct for the \ufb01rst time. Further, products which are rather infre-\nquently purchased by mainstream consumers, but majorly exist in\norganic quality, such as silken tofu, are often accompanied by\nproduct recipes or other notes for use. Effects of those preparation\ntips are not analyzed either.\nConclusions\nWith regard to product design , it is striking that most studies\ntreat the subtopic in general terms. With the exception of Stolz\net al. (2009) who focus on \ufb01ve products in different European\ncountries, studies neither go into depth nor address detailed ques-\ntions of consumers\u2019 quality demands and perceptions.\nThe majority of these studies treat organic consumers explicitly.\nThrough taking a look at consumers\u2019 expectations of organic prod-\nucts in general, useful insights are generated into how to attract\nnew consumers and promote the consumption of organic products.\nExceptions are the studies of Hill and Lynchhaun (2002) and Hoef-\nkens et al. (2009) , which compare organic and conventional prod-\nucts explicitly. Despite the fact that studies originate from different\ncountries, and focus on different products using different dat-\nabases, common attributes connected with organic products arefound in much of the research. These are properties of the core\nand the actual product: sensory characteristics (taste), nutritional\nquality and health. Further relevant attributes depend on the study\nin question but, in the main, the focus is on the augmented prod-\nuct: environmental friendliness, animal welfare and the absence\nof pesticide input.\nA few studies focus on results which are not potentially trans-\nferable to other product categories due to their speci\ufb01city. In this\ncontext, research has been undertaken speci\ufb01cally on \ufb01sh and\nmeat, and on organic plus products.\nAlthough the use of various research methodologies can be as-\nsessed valuable, it is striking that many studies were still explor-\natory in nature. This indicates that many possible \ufb01elds remain\nto be further developed.\nOn the packaging and design of organic products, there are\nvery few results available to date. Even though there are manifold\npublications on this subtopic relating to products in general, and\nalso to green packaging ( Rokka & Uusitalo, 2008 ), few insightsare given with respect to organic products. There is a need for stud-\nies which focus on the speci\ufb01c expectations of consumers regard-\ning coherent organic product presentation, especially since\nalmost 70% of purchase decisions are made at the point of sale\n(GfK, 2012 ).\nLabelling issues, including the extent of knowledge and trust in\norganic labels, preferences for different organic labels, and prefer-\nences for organic in comparison with other kinds of labels have\nalso been examined in relevant studies. In Europe, the state of\nknowledge about labelling was found to be poor and, additionally,\nwas not based on objective consumer information ( Janssen and\nHamm (2012) . In the USA, a label is seen as the means of identify-\ning the organic product as such ( Essoussi & Zahaf, 2009 ).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4486, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f7517b7-fe68-410c-9562-23bc06aa1f82": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f7517b7-fe68-410c-9562-23bc06aa1f82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "428", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a6cdc10-2c70-4c66-a19c-b618f8dabad5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "428", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "af65d05de2fd26a8e172c837352638f3c010e482546e1c5ff7e88c33eec39ac2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1f0fd80-0c49-4c88-906b-d6506ec4ead9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "428", "file_name": "data/Chap24.pdf"}, "hash": "a24235c063b4698d457913eb5dfcf3fbd99eceee70bf019972385698d9159d42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6599f9e4-c449-4571-866d-590242549c86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37a5f9cbc31e0f6f47a23aa928ef27445431e60fd3e4fd68b6e86d6008efbd3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There is a need for stud-\nies which focus on the speci\ufb01c expectations of consumers regard-\ning coherent organic product presentation, especially since\nalmost 70% of purchase decisions are made at the point of sale\n(GfK, 2012 ).\nLabelling issues, including the extent of knowledge and trust in\norganic labels, preferences for different organic labels, and prefer-\nences for organic in comparison with other kinds of labels have\nalso been examined in relevant studies.

In the USA, a label is seen as the means of identify-\ning the organic product as such ( Essoussi & Zahaf, 2009 ). Levels of\ntrust in organic products depend very much on the country con-\ncerned. Additionally, Sonderskov and Daugbjerg (2011) further\nindicate that trust in governmental labels is stronger where there\nis a substantial state involvement. Generally, in Scandinavian\ncountries, trust in governmental labels seems to be substantial\n(see Hjelmar, 2011; Sonderskov & Daugbjerg, 2011; Wier, O\u2019Doher-\nty Jensen, Andersen, & Millock, 2008 ). In the USA, trust in labelling\nis not that pronounced and \ufb01ndings also differ in the UK. Clearly,\ngiven the variation in labels and the diversity of products in differ-\nent countries, consumer trust and preferences with regard to par-\nticular labels and schemes will also vary. In the USA and also in\nJapan, organic products compete directly with products that are la-\nbelled as \u2018natural\u2019. Preferences for products labelled with health\nclaims or PDO/PGI have also been discussed in some studies.\nIn the organic context, few publications exist on the subject of\nproduct range and, of these, only the study by Buder and Hamm\n(2011) for the German market identi\ufb01ed speci\ufb01c gaps in product\nassortment. However, a further two publications also focus on\nthe German market and both identify product gaps relating to\nthe assortment for organic convenience foods. Brand policy has\nbeen little explored, although there are a few insights into the\ntrade-off between organic labels and retail brands, and the\nstrength of organic brands.\nProduct innovation as a research theme remains completely un-\ntouched and, similarly, no studies were evident on product support\nservices within the organic sector.\nReferences\nAarset, B., Beckmann, S., Bigne, E., Beveridge, M., Bjorndal, T., Bunting, J., et al.\n(2004).
