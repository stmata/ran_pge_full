Yet Tesla\u2019s focus is on gaining share \nfrom the traditional car market. \u201cOur true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric \ncars being produced, \u201d argued Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk, \u201cbut rather the enormous flood of gasoline \ncars pouring out of the world\u2019s factories every day. \u201d In the fall of 2020, Elon Musk laid out a plan \nfor Tesla to build a $25,000 electric car using drastically lower-cost batteries to potentially turn the \ncompany into the world\u2019s largest car manufacturer.1\nMarketing planning begins with formulating an offering to meet target customers\u2019 needs or wants. The \ncustomer will judge the offering\u2019s benefits on three basic elements: product, service, and brand. \u00a0In this \nchapter we examine product; in Chapter 9, services; and in Chapter 10, brand. All three elements\u2014\nproduct, service, and brand\u2014must be fused into a competitively attractive market offering.\nProduct Differentiation\nTo successfully compete in the market, products must be differentiated. At one extreme are products \nthat allow little variation: chicken, aspirin, and steel. Yet even here some differentiation is  possible: \nPerdue chickens, Bayer aspirin, and India\u2019s Tata Steel have carved out distinct identities in their \n categories. Procter & Gamble makes Tide, Cheer, and Gain laundry detergents, each with a separate \nbrand identity. At the other extreme are products that lend themselves to high differentiation, such \nas automobiles, commercial buildings, and furniture. Here the seller faces an abundance of differen -\ntiation possibilities.\nWell-differentiated products can create significant competitive advantages. Crafting a distinctive \naura for a product that helps distance it from competitors can involve moves that range from impres -\nsive technological advances like Intuitive Surgical\u2019s da Vinci robotic system for minimally invasive \nsurgery to simple tweaks like putting a Chiquita sticker on a banana. Some brands, such as De Beers, \ndifferentiate their products by tying them to special occasions. Others, including Tropicana and Tiffany, \nuse packaging to ensure that they stand out from their respective competitors.\nAttributes on the basis of which to differentiate include core functionality, features, performance \nquality, conformance quality, durability, reliability, form, style, and customization.2 Design has become \nan increasingly important differentiator, and we discuss it separately later in the chapter.\n\u2022 Core functionality.

Once the pride of Finland, the \ncompany has found itself outsold by Samsung even on its home soil. How could \nsuch a high-flying brand come crashing to earth? In a nutshell, it failed to innovate \nand stay relevant. Nokia did not respond to the wildly successful iPhone and the \nshifting consumer demand that accompanied it. The company thought the iPhone \nwas too expensive to manufacture and was not up to its own product standards. \nThe iPhone reportedly failed Nokia\u2019s \u201cdrop test,\u201d in which a phone is dropped on \nconcrete from a height of five feet at different angles. Nokia had actually spent \n$40\u00a0billion on R&D over the preceding decade and was a smart-phone pioneer, but \nit chose not to invest in devices that anticipated what the iPhone eventually became. \nWithout the right new products, Nokia began to be associated by consumers with \nan earlier era of technology, a fatal blow in the fast-moving, technologically intensive \nsmart-phone market.3\n>> Failure to keep \ninnovating and stay \nrelevant allowed \ncompetitors to oust \npioneer Nokia from its \nperch as the former \nleader in the technology-\nintense mobile phone \nindustry.\nSource: Lenscap/Alamy Stock Photo\ntell consumers how to use and benefit from them.5 For example, although Apple\u2019s sleek looks \nattracted attention, it was the simplified and more intuitive user interface that lured even tech-\nphobic customers to the computer market and gained it a cult following. Marketers must also think \nin terms of feature bundles or packages. Auto companies often manufacture cars at several \u201ctrim \nlevels.\u201d This lowers manufacturing and inventory costs. Each company must decide whether to \noffer feature customization at a higher cost or a few standard packages at a lower cost.\n\u2022 Performance quality  is the level at which the product\u2019s primary characteristics operate.  Quality \nis growing increasingly important for differentiation as companies adopt a value model and pro -\nvide higher quality for less money. Firms should design a performance level appropriate to the \ntarget market and competition\u2014however, not necessarily the highest level possible. They must \nalso manage performance quality through time. Continuously improving the product can pro -\nduce high returns and market share; failing to do so can have negative consequences. The latter \nproved to be the case for Kodak and Commodore.\n\u2022 Conformance quality.  Buyers expect high conformance quality , the degree to which all pro -\nduced units are identical and meet promised specifications. Suppose a Porsche 911 is designed to \naccelerate to 60 miles per hour within 10 seconds. If every Porsche 911 coming off the assembly \nline does this, the model is said to have high conformance quality. A product with low confor -\nmance quality will disappoint some buyers. Firms thoroughly test finished products to ensure \nconformance. Although men account for almost three-quarters of the world\u2019s beer sales, SAB -\nMiller found that women were actually more sensitive to levels of flavor in beer and thus were \nbetter product testers.6\n\u2022 Durability,  a measure of the product\u2019s expected operating life under natural or stressful condi -\ntions, is a valued attribute for vehicles, kitchen appliances, and other durable goods. The extra \nprice for durability must not be excessive, however, and the product must not be subject to overly \nrapid technological obsolescence, as personal computers, televisions, and cell phones have some -\ntimes been.\n\u2022 Reliability  is a measure of the probability that a product will not malfunction within a speci -\nfied time period. Maytag has an outstanding reputation for creating reliable home appliances. Its \nlong-running \u201cLonely Repairman\u201d ad campaign was designed to highlight that attribute. Buyers \nnormally will pay a premium for more reliable products.\u2022 Features.  Most products can be offered with varying features that supplement \ntheir basic function. A company can identify and select appropriate new features \nby surveying recent buyers and then calculating customer value  versus company cost  \nfor each potential feature. Marketers should consider how many people want each \nfeature, how long it would take to introduce it, and whether competitors could eas -\nily copy it.4 To avoid \u201cfeature fatigue,\u201d the company must prioritize features and \nMercedes-Benz  In the midst of the first decade of this century, Mercedes-Benz endured \none of the most painful stretches in its history. The company saw its reputation for stellar quality \ntake a beating in J. D. Power and other surveys, and BMW surpassed it in global sales.

Consider the many possible forms of aspirin. Although essentially a commodity, aspirin \ncan be differentiated by dosage, size, shape, color, coating, or action time.\n\u2022 Style  describes the product\u2019s look and feel to the buyer and creates distinctiveness that is hard \nto copy. Car buyers pay a premium for Jaguars because of their extraordinary looks. Aesthetics \nplays a key role for such brands as Apple computers, Godiva chocolate, and Harley-Davidson \nmotorcycles.8 Strong style does not always mean high performance, however. A car may look \nsensational but spend a lot of time in the repair shop.\n\u2022 Customization  Customized products and marketing enable firms to differentiate strategically \nby finding out exactly what a person wants\u2014and doesn\u2019t want\u2014and delivering on that.9 Online \nretailers such as Zazzle and CafePress allow users to upload images and create their own clothing \nand posters or to buy merchandise created by other users. NikeiD, which allows customers to \npersonalize and design their own shoes and clothing either online or in store at NikeiD Studios, \ngenerates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The demand for customization is certainly \nthere. One Forrester study found that more than a third of U.S. online consumers were inter -\nested in customizing product features or in purchasing build-to-order products that use their \nspecifications. And companies have responded: M&M\u2019s allows you to print specialized messages \non your candies; Pottery Barn Kids allows you to personalize a children\u2019s book; and for $2,000 \nor so, Burberry allows you to select the fabric, color, style, and five other features for your own \npersonalized trench coat.10\nProduct Design\nAs competition intensifies, design offers a potent way to differentiate and position a company\u2019s prod -\nucts and services. Design  is the totality of features that affect the way consumers perceive a  product\u2019s \nlook, feel, and function. Design offers functional and aesthetic benefits and appeals to both our ratio -\nnal and emotional sides.11a\u00a0year earlier and put each new model through 10,000 diagnostics that run 24 hours a day for \nthree weeks. Mercedes-Benz also tripled its number of prototypes for new designs, allowing \nengineers to drive them 3 million miles before production. With these and other changes, the \nnumber of flaws in the company\u2019s cars dropped 72 percent from the 2002 peak, and warranty \ncosts decreased 25 percent. As an interesting side effect, Mercedes-Benz dealers have had to \ncontend with a sizable drop in their repair and service businesses.7\n<< Many different   \nproducts, such as \nM&Ms, can now \nbe  customized by \nconsumers.\nSource: Ekaterina_Minaeva/Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0196389a-c5e2-4b01-a6f6-1b114ea94c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0196389a-c5e2-4b01-a6f6-1b114ea94c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9478a2d0-ca16-41c2-8b19-7ed11975265b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "d922a2134e98f1588fba7613e8017b2bcc3f4ad0f9ea8de1d806d9be793d086a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a98a6af3-b3b6-4bd9-b0b1-27d0914948bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "36ad18ebc1d9297eafa764b1b02e68a596956e13ff1b4d399b6f64da55ef89db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9dcd173b-f677-4645-8b24-1c9c593c4a98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "256bbf005258f8fbb438df8f29ceae0bf088c4a94843bc144eaec30d56336815", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "164 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nPOWER OF DESIGN\nIn our visually oriented culture, transmitting brand meaning and positioning through design is critical. \nEye-catching form, color, and graphics can help an offering separate itself from competitive  products. \n\u201cIn a crowded marketplace,\u201d writes Virginia Postrel in The Substance of Style,  \u201caesthetics is often the only \nway to make a product stand out.\u201d12 Design is especially important with long-lasting durable goods \nsuch as automobiles. Cognizant of consumers\u2019 desire for both form and functionality, Tesla excelled \nin developing a car that is both good for the environment and aesthetically appealing.\nDesign can shift consumer perceptions to make brand experiences more rewarding. Consider the \nlengths Boeing went to in making its 787 aircraft seem roomier and more comfortable. Raised center \nbins, side luggage bins, divider panels, gently arched ceilings, and raised seats make the aircraft interior \nseem bigger. One design engineer noted, \u201cIf we do our jobs, people don\u2019t realize what we have done. \nThey just say they feel more comfortable.\u201d\nAs holistic marketers recognize the emotional power of design and the importance to consumers \nof look and feel as well as function, design is exerting a stronger influence in categories where it once \nplayed a small role. Herman Miller office furniture, Viking ranges and kitchen appliances, and Kohler \nkitchen and bathroom fixtures and faucets are among the brands that now stand out in their categories, \nthanks to attractive looks added to efficient and effective performance.\nSome countries have developed strong reputations for their design skills and accomplishments, such \nas Italy in apparel and furniture and Scandinavia in products designed for functionality, aesthetics, and envi -\nronmental consciousness. Finland\u2019s Marimekko fabrics, which brought the breadth of colorful and unusual \nFinnish textiles to the attention of the world, are still being made using environmentally safe techniques. \nAnd the Finnish firm Fiskars, which dates back to the 17th century, is known around the world not only \nfor Fiskars products but also for such other internationally recognized brands as Wedgwood, Waterford, \nArabia, and Royal Doulton. Dyson put the United Kingdom on the international product design map by \nelevating the form and efficiency of such \u201chomely\u201d products as vacuums, fans, and hair dryers to a high art.\nAPPROACHES TO DESIGN\nDesign is not just a phase in creating a product, service, or application. It\u2019s a way of thinking that pene -\ntrates all aspects of the marketing program so all design aspects work together. For the company, a well-\ndesigned product is easy to manufacture and distribute. For the customer, it is pleasant to look at and \neasy to open, install, use, repair, and dispose of. The designer must take all these goals into account.13\nGiven the creative nature of design, it\u2019s no surprise there isn\u2019t one widely adopted approach. Some \nfirms employ formal, structured processes. Design thinking  is a very data-driven approach with three \nphases: observation, ideation, and implementation. Design thinking requires intensive ethnographic \nstudies of consumers, creative brainstorming sessions, and collaborative teamwork to decide how to \nbring the design idea to reality. Whirlpool used design thinking to develop the KitchenAid Architect \nkitchen appliances with a more harmonized look than had previously existed in the category. Another \ncompany known for its design prowess is Bang & Olufsen.\nBang & Olufsen  The Danish firm Bang & Olufsen (B&O)\u2014which has received many kudos  \nfor the design of its stereos, TV equipment, and telephones\u2014trusts the instincts of a handful \nof designers who rarely consult with consumers.

Each product \nmust be related to other products to ensure that a firm is offering the optimal set of products to fulfill \nthe needs of its different customer segments.\nPRODUCT PORTFOLIO DESIGN\nA product portfolio  encompasses all products offered by a company, including various product cat -\negories and product lines. For example, the extensive iPhone product portfolio includes headphones \nand headsets, cables and docks, armbands, cases, power and car accessories, and speakers. NEC\u2019s (Japan) \nportfolio consists of communication products and computer products. Michelin has three product lines: \ntires, maps, and restaurant-rating services. At Northwestern University, separate academic deans oversee \nthe schools of medicine, law, business, engineering, music, journalism, and liberal arts, among others.\nA company\u2019s product portfolio has a certain width, length, depth, and consistency. These concepts \nare illustrated in Figure 8.1 for selected Procter & Gamble consumer products.\n\u2022 The width  of a product portfolio is the number of different product lines the company carries.  \nFigure 8.1 shows a product portfolio width of three lines. (In fact, P&G produces many additional lines.)\n\u2022 The length  of a product portfolio is the total number of items in the mix. In Figure 8.1, it is 12. We \ncan also talk about the average length of a line. We obtain this by dividing the total length (here \n12) by the number of lines (here 3), for an average product line length of 4.\n\u2022 The depth  of a product portfolio consists of the number of variants offered for each product in \nthe line. If Tide came in two scents (Clean Breeze and Regular), in two formulations (liquid and \npowder), and with two additives (with and without bleach), it would have a depth of six because \nthere are six distinct variants.17 We can calculate the average depth of P&G\u2019s product mix by \naveraging the number of variants within the brand groups.\n\u2022 The consistency  of the product portfolio reflects how closely related the various product lines \nare in end use, production requirements, distribution channels, or some other way. P&G\u2019s prod -\nuct lines are consistent in that they are consumer goods that go through the same distribution \n channels. The lines are less consistent in the functions they perform for buyers.\nThese four product mix dimensions permit a company to expand its business in four ways. It can \nadd new product lines, thus widening its product mix. It can lengthen each product line. It can add \nmore product variants to each product and thereby deepen its product mix. Finally, a company can \npursue more product line consistency. To make these product, service, and brand decisions, marketers \ncan conduct product line analysis.\nPRODUCT LINE ANALYSIS\nA product line  is a group of related products sold by the same company. In offering a product line, \ncompanies normally develop a basic platform and modules that can be added to meet different cus -\ntomer requirements and lower production costs. Car manufacturers build cars around a basic  platform. \nHomebuilders show a model home to which buyers can add additional features.

Supermarkets make almost no margin on bread and milk, reasonable margins on canned and \nfrozen foods, and better margins on flowers, ethnic food lines, and freshly baked goods. Companies \nshould recognize that different items will allow for different margins and develop strategies for maxi -\nmizing the profitability of the entire product line.\nThe product line manager must review how the line is positioned against competitors\u2019 lines. \n Consider Paper Company X with a paperboard product line.20 Two paperboard attributes are weight \nand finish quality. Paper is usually offered at standard levels of 90, 120, 150, and 180 weights. Finish \nquality is offered at low, medium, and high levels.\nA product map allows a company to see its main competitors at a glance. It also helps planners \nto identify market segments and spot market opportunities. The map in Figure 8.2 shows the location \nof the various product line items of Company X and four competitors, A, B, C, and D. Competitor \nA sells two product items in the extra-high-weight class ranging from medium to low finish quality. \n Competitor B sells four items that vary in weight and finish quality. Competitor C sells three items in \nwhich the greater the weight, the greater the finish quality. Competitor D sells three items, all lightweight \nbut varying in finish quality. Company X offers three items that vary in weight and finish quality.\nThe product map also shows which competitors\u2019 items are competing against Company X\u2019s items. \nFor example, Company X\u2019s low-weight, medium-quality paper competes against competitor D\u2019s and \nB\u2019s papers, but its high-weight, medium-quality paper has no direct competitor. The map also reveals \npossible locations for new items. No manufacturer offers a high-weight, low-quality paper. If Company \nX estimates a strong unmet demand and can produce this paper at low cost and price it accordingly, it \ncould consider adding this paper to its line.\nAnother benefit of product mapping is that it identifies market segments. Figure 8.2 shows the \ntypes of paper, by weight and quality, preferred by the general printing industry, the point-of-purchase \ndisplay industry, and the office supply industry. The map shows that Company X is well positioned \nto serve the needs of the general printing industry but less effective in serving the other two markets.\nMultibrand companies all over the world try to optimize their brand portfolios. This often means \nfocusing on core brand growth and concentrating resources on the biggest and most established \nbrands. Hasbro has designated a set of core toy brands to emphasize in its marketing, including GI Joe, \nTransformers, and My Little Pony. Procter & Gamble\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy has concentrated on \nbrands with more than $1 billion in revenue, such as Tide, Crest, Pampers, and Pringles. Every product \nin a product line must play a role, as must every brand in the brand portfolio.\nFIGURE 8.2 \nProduct Map  \nfor a Paper-Product \nLine\nSource: Benson P.

But \nthe recession and consumer fatigue with the brand were a double \nwhammy that led to a steep drop in sales and drove the stock price \ndown to a mere $1 in what crocs cFO later called a \u201cnear-death \nexperience.\u201d By 2011, however, crocs had rebounded with more than \n$1\u00a0billion in revenue and growth goals of 15 percent to  \n20 percent. What happened? The company had diversified into more \nthan 300 models of stylish, comfortable boots, loafers, sneakers, and other shoes that helped \nto reduce its reliance on clogs to less than 50 percent of sales. It also adopted a multichannel \ndistribution approach to sell wholesale through retailers like Kohl\u2019s and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods  \n(60 percent of business), as well as directly online (10 percent) and through more than 500 of its \nown retail stores (30 percent).

Every company\u2019s product line covers a certain part of the total possible range. \nFor example, Mercedes automobiles are located in the upper price range of the automobile market. \nLine stretching  occurs when a company lengthens its product line beyond its current range, whether \ndown-market, up-market, or both ways.\nDown-Market Stretch.  A company positioned in the middle market may want to introduce a \nlower-priced line for several reasons. First, a company may notice strong growth opportunities in the \nlower-tier market and enter this market to capture some of this growth. Alternatively, a company might \nbe forced to move downscale because the middle market is stagnating or declining. Finally, a company \nmight stretch its product line downscale to tie up lower-end competitors who might otherwise try to \nmove up-market. Indeed, when a company has been attacked by a low-end competitor, it often decides \nto counterattack by entering the low end of the market.\nWhen launching downscale product line extensions, companies face a number of branding \nchoices. One option is to use the parent brand name on all its offerings. Sony has used its name on \nproducts in a variety of price tiers. An alternative approach is to introduce lower-priced offerings using \na sub-brand name, such as P&G\u2019s Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. Yet another option is to introduce \nthe lower-priced offerings under a different name, such as the Gap\u2019s Old Navy brand. This strategy is \nexpensive to implement and means brand equity will have to be built from scratch, but the equity of \nthe parent brand name is protected.\nMoving down-market carries risks that include dilution of the core brand\u2019s image and cannibal -\nization of the core brand\u2019s sales. P&G introduced Tide Basic in test markets\u2014priced lower but also \nlacking some of the latest detergent technology of its famous parent brand\u2014and decided against roll -\ning it out.28 On the other hand, Mercedes successfully introduced its C-Class cars at $30,000 without", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91090aa1-9f9d-4601-9bd2-0512ca39bce4": {"__data__": {"id_": "91090aa1-9f9d-4601-9bd2-0512ca39bce4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "151738c4-e2bc-4678-9a86-b881f5593934", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "f21d63cd4936469c8e8c56336917f87d81b6ea74baa1cc34fd47a6566f5779b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbfcb0aa-a6c4-440e-be28-08f62c8ab2d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "9d6aa2c472b8c6d43ab5aff433ffeaca2dad4616e62af9e42c886e07a6683382", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d31c8a9-e343-4dda-bff1-b385c81b0848", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50b49b632956c1c5ac6aa892e55def307a8773c392f40def22d6fad14e6b3fbf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "170 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nimpairing its ability to sell other Mercedes cars for $100,000. John Deere introduced a lower-priced \nline of lawn tractors called Sabre from John Deere, while still selling its more expensive tractors under \nthe John Deere name. In these cases, consumers may have been better able to compartmentalize the \ndifferent offerings and understand the functional differences between them.29\nUp-Market Stretch.  Companies may wish to enter the high end of the market to achieve more \ngrowth, realize higher margins, or simply position themselves as full-line manufacturers. Many \n markets have spawned upscale segments: Starbucks in coffee, H\u00e4agen-Dazs in ice cream, and Evian \nin bottled water. The leading Japanese auto companies each introduced a highly successful upscale \nautomobile nameplate: Toyota\u2019s Lexus, Nissan\u2019s Infiniti, and Honda\u2019s Acura. They invented entirely \nnew names because consumers might not have given the brand \u201cpermission\u201d to stretch upward when \nthose lines were first introduced. Moving up-market is not without risks, however. A company might \nlack the resources\u2014infrastructure, know-how, and people\u2014to develop a superior product that will \nfit the needs of its upscale target customers.\nSome companies have used their core brands in moving up-market. Gallo sells Gallo Family \n Vineyards (priced at $10 to $30 a bottle) with a hip, younger image to compete in the premium wine \nsegment. General Electric introduced the GE Profile brand for its large-appliance offerings in the \nupscale market. In order to signal consumers that there\u2019s been a quality improvement, some brands \nhave used modifiers like \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cenhanced.\u201d Consider Ultra Dry Pampers, Extra Strength Tylenol, \nand Power Pro Dustbuster Plus.\nTwo-Way Stretch.  Companies serving the middle market might stretch their line in both directions \nto effectively blanket the market with products and \u201csandwich\u201d their competition. This carries the risks \ninvolved in both down-market and up-market stretches. However, this strategy can work, as evidenced \nby Robert Mondavi Winery, now owned by Constellation Brands. Mondavi sells $35 bottles of wine as \nthe first premium \u201cNew World\u201d wine; it also sells $125 bottles of Mondavi Reserve at high-end winer -\nies, restaurants, and vineyards and through direct order, as well as $11 bottles of Woodbridge created \nduring the grape oversupply of the mid-1990s. Purina further illustrates how simultaneous up- and \ndown-market extension can be effective.\nPurina Dog Food  Purina Dog Food has stretched up and down to create a product \nline differentiated by benefits to dogs, breadth of varieties, ingredients, and price.

A firm can also lengthen its product line through line filling \u2014that is, by adding \nmore items within the existing range. Motives for line filling include reaching for incremental profits, \nsatisfying dealers who complain about lost sales because of items missing from the line, addressing \nconsumers\u2019 desire for variety,30 trying to become the leading full-line company, and plugging holes to \nkeep out competitors. Consider the way BMW has been filling the gaps in its product line.\nBMW AG  Over time, BMW has morphed from a one-brand, five-model carmaker into a \npowerhouse with three brands, 14 series, and roughly 30 distinct models. Not only has the \ncarmaker expanded its product range downward with MINI coopers and its compact 1-series \nmodels, but it has also built it upward with Rolls-Royce and filled in the gaps with its sports \nactivity vehicles, roadsters, and coupes. The company has used line filling successfully to boost \nits appeal to the rich, the super-rich, and the hope-to-be-rich, all without departing from its pure \npremium positioning. BMW has also built a clear brand migration strategy within its product line, \ntrying to move its customers from lower-end to higher-end vehicles.31\nLine filling is overdone if it results in cannibalization, causes confusion, or merely does not \naddress the needs of any customer segment. Indeed, if the offerings are too similar to one another, \ncustomers are likely to be confused about which to choose. And if offerings vary in price, they may \noverwhelmingly buy the cheaper one. In addition to avoiding confusion and cannibalization, the \nproposed offering should meet a genuine market need, rather than being added simply to satisfy an \ninternal need. The infamous Edsel automobile, on which Ford lost $350 million in the late 1950s, met \nFord\u2019s internal positioning need for a car between its Ford and Lincoln lines, but it clearly did not meet \nthe market\u2019s needs at all.\nManaging Packaging and Labeling\nMany marketers view packaging and labeling as an important element of product strategy. Some \nproduct packages\u2014such as the Coke bottle, Tiffany\u2019s blue box, and the Red Bull can\u2014are world \nfamous.\nPACKAGING\nPackaging includes all the activities of designing and producing the container for a product. Packages \nmight have up to three layers, with one or more of these layers designed to capture the purchas -\ner\u2019s attention and ensure that the product is distinct from the competition. Cool Water cologne by \n Davidoff For Men comes in a signature blue bottle with white lettering ( primary package ) inside a blue \ncardboard box with white lettering ( secondary package ), shipped in a corrugated box ( shipping package ) \nto protect the six dozen bottles in cardboard boxes.\nPackaging is important because it is the buyer\u2019s first encounter with the product. A good pack -\nage draws the consumer in and encourages product choice. In effect, it can act as a \u201cfive-second \ncommercial\u201d for the product. Some packages can even be attractively displayed at home. Distinctive \npackaging like that for Kiwi shoe polish, Altoids mints, and Absolut vodka is an important part of a \nbrand\u2019s equity.\nSeveral factors contribute to the growing use of packaging as a marketing tool.\n\u2022 Self-service.  In an average supermarket, which may stock 15,000 items, the typical shopper \npasses some 300 products per minute. Given that 50 percent to 70 percent of all purchases are \nmade in the store, effective packaging must perform many sales tasks: attract attention, describe \nthe product\u2019s features, create consumer confidence, and make a favorable overall impression.\n\u2022 Consumer affluence.  Affluent consumers are willing to pay a little more for the convenience, \nappearance, dependability, and prestige of better packaging.\n\u2022 Company and brand image.  Packaging contributes to instant recognition of the company or \nbrand.

To achieve these objectives and satisfy consumers\u2019 desires, marketers must ensure that the \nfunctional and aesthetic components of packaging are aligned with one another and, at the same time, \nare optimized to create value for customers and the company. Functionally, structural design is crucial. \nThe packaging elements must harmonize with one another and with pricing, advertising, and other \nparts of the marketing program.32 Aesthetic considerations involve a package\u2019s size and shape, mate -\nrial, color, text, and graphics.33\nColor is a particularly important aspect of packaging and carries different meanings in different \ncultures and market segments. As one expert says, \u201cColor is all-pervasive. It is language-neutral, but \nloaded with meaning. It\u2019s completely overt, yet each person sees color through different eyes, both \nliterally and figuratively.\u201d34 Color can define a brand, from Tiffany\u2019s blue box to Cadbury\u2019s purple \nwrapping and UPS\u2019s brown trucks. Orange, the telecom mobile operator, uses color as both its look \nand its very name!\nOne of the reasons why color is important is that different colors can have different meanings \nand convey different emotions. Consider the following interpretations of different colors that some \nmarketing experts believe are common in Western culture.35\nRed symbolizes excitement, energy, passion, courage, and being bold. Orange  connotes \nfriendliness and fun, combining the energy of red and the warmth of yellow. Yellow , the \ncolor of the sun, is equated with warmth, joy, and happiness. Green , the color of nature, con -\nnotes health, growth, freshness, and renewal. Blue , the color of the sky and sea, is associated \nwith dependability, trust, competence, and integrity. Purple  symbolizes nobility, wealth, and \nwisdom, combining the stability of blue and the energy of red. Pink  is considered to have \nsoft, peaceful, comforting qualities.

Engineering tests  ensure that \nthe package stands up under normal conditions; visual tests  confirm that the script is legible and the \ncolors harmonious; dealer tests  determine that dealers find the packages attractive and easy to handle; \nand consumer tests  establish that buyers will respond favorably.\nWhen developing effective packaging, companies must consider its environmental impact.

It might carry a great deal of information or only the brand name. Even if the seller prefers \na simple label, the law may require more.\nA label performs several functions. First, it identifies  the product or brand, as does the name  Sunkist \nstamped on oranges. It might also grade  the product; canned peaches are grade-labeled A, B, and C. \nThe label might describe  the product: who made it, where and when, what it contains, how it is to be \nused, and how to use it safely. Finally, the label might promote  the product through attractive  graphics. \nFor example, advanced technology allows 360-degree shrink-wrapped labels to replace glued-on \npaper labels, so containers can be surrounded with bright graphics and accommodate more product \ninformation.\nLabels eventually need freshening up. The label on Ivory soap has been redesigned at least 18\u00a0times \nsince the 1890s, with gradual changes in the size and design of the letters. As Tropicana found out, \ncompanies with labels that have become icons need to tread very carefully in order to preserve key \nbranding elements when undertaking a redesign.\nA long history of legal concerns surrounds labels and packaging. In 1914, the Federal Trade \n Commission Act held that false, misleading, or deceptive labels or packages constitute unfair \n competition. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, passed by Congress in 1967, set mandatory label -\ning requirements, encouraged voluntary industry packaging standards, and allowed federal agencies \nto set packaging regulations in specific industries.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required processed-food producers to include nutri -\ntional labeling that clearly states the amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and calories contained in \nproducts, as well as vitamin and mineral content as a percentage of the recommended daily allowance. \nThe FDA has also taken action against potentially misleading uses of such descriptions as \u201clight,\u201d \u201chigh-\nfiber,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201clow-fat.\u201d\nNot all countries apply such strict definitions. In the United Kingdom, \u201clight\u201d and \u201clite\u201d do not have \nan official meaning in law, although \u201clow-fat\u201d does\u2014the food product must be less than 3 percent fat \nto qualify. As a result, some foods branded \u201clight\u201d there have been found to contain up to seven times \nmore fat than those described as \u201clow-fat.\u201d40\nManaging Guarantees and Warranties\nAll sellers are legally responsible for fulfilling a buyer\u2019s normal or reasonable expectations.  Guarantees \nand warranties are explicit or implicit promises by sellers that the product will perform as speci -\nfied or that the seller will fix it or refund the customer\u2019s money during a specified period. Products \nunder warranty or guarantee can be returned to the manufacturer or a designated repair center for \nrepair, replacement, or refund. Whether expressed or implied, guarantees and warranties are legally \nenforceable.\nA guarantee  ensures that if a product fails to function as promised by the company or as custom -\ners expect, the company will provide some type of compensation to the purchaser. Detailing the pro -\ncess of addressing potential product failures up front adds credibility to the company\u2019s claims, reduces \nthe functional and monetary risk associated with using the product, and creates peace-of-mind value \nfor customers. Besides creating customer value, guarantees also can be beneficial to the company: They \nintensify its focus on the customer experience, establish accountability, expedite the development of \nperformance standards, and provide guidelines for recovering from failures.41\nMany sellers offer either general or specific guarantees. A company such as Procter & Gamble \npromises general or complete satisfaction without being more specific: \u201cIf you are not satisfied for \nany reason, return for replacement, exchange, or refund.\u201d A.T. Cross guarantees its Cross pens and \npencils for life. The customer mails the pen to A.T. Cross (mailers are provided at stores), and the pen \nis repaired or replaced at no charge.\nA company can provide customers with an overall satisfaction  guarantee that applies to any facet of \nthe product experience, whether it involves the actual quality of the product or the customer\u2019s assess -\nment of product quality. Or the company might provide a specific attribute  guarantee that applies to a \nparticular aspect of the product, such as performance, reliability, or durability. Product guarantees can \nbe valid for a specified time period such as one year, or they might involve a variable time frame\u2014for \nexample, the life of the product or the customer.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4778, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "109ea3c3-ff66-4482-b043-0de797b2fec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "109ea3c3-ff66-4482-b043-0de797b2fec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19d7ca77-57d6-4b0b-bd91-318aa736fbc6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "48a2cdb4188329ea1d7f2b968e5a882a1334be499deb9684941f6b1f7c08fddc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b6dc79d-c7c8-43e4-b427-ce0d79e83a7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "49df7bca471e5d51912627851fe22316709e0861dc1a2922def311dce35fe319", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a3ffa55-902b-45ef-b17c-e96e9b2ff89b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a5bf0424661c8f65f910e15acac12a97d18404277d3cb8400ad9773964a985a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 8    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  PRODU cTS 175\nWarranties  provide customers and the company with much the same benefits as guarantees do. \nHowever, warranties and guarantees differ on two key dimensions. Warranties usually cover the repair \nor replacement of the purchased item and usually do not allow the customer to return the product for \na refund, which is the case with guarantees. Furthermore, whereas guarantees are always provided free \nof charge and require no additional payment from customers, warranties are available to extend the \nfree warranty that comes with the product. Such extended warranties do require added payment and \ncan be acquired at the time the product is purchased or at a later date.42\nExtended warranties and service contracts can be extremely lucrative for manufacturers and retail -\ners. Analysts estimate that warranty sales have accounted for a large percentage of Best Buy\u2019s operating \nprofits. Despite evidence that buying extended warranties does not pay off, some consumers value the \npeace of mind they offer.43 These warranties still generate billions of dollars in revenue for U.S. suppli -\ners of electronic goods, although the total has declined as consumers have become more comfortable \nseeking solutions to technical problems online or from friends.44\nGuarantees and warranties reduce the buyer\u2019s perceived risk. They suggest that the product is of \nhigh quality and that the company and its service performance are dependable. They can be especially \nhelpful when the company or product is not well known or when the product\u2019s quality is superior to \nthat of competitors. Hyundai\u2019s and Kia\u2019s highly successful 10-year or 100,000-mile power train war -\nranty programs were designed in part to assure potential buyers of the quality of the products and the \nstability of the companies.\nEffective product guarantees and warranties should have three traits: They need to be relevant , easily \nunderstood , and easy for the customer to invoke . For a guarantee to be relevant, the guaranteed feature of the \noffering should be of importance to customers. Guarantees and warranties are of limited or no value \nto customers when they apply to features that customers do not perceive as important or that rarely \nmalfunction. Guarantees and warranties are easy for customers to understand when the company\u2019s \npromise and the measures that customers need to take in the event that the product fails are stated in \na simple, straightforward manner. Guarantees and warranties are easy for customers to invoke\u2014and \nare more easily communicated to customers\u2014when they contain a limited number of exclusions and \nlimitations. This reduces the amount of time and effort needed for customers to exercise their recourse \nto satisfaction should the product fail to live up to the stipulations of the guarantee or warranty.45\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\n\u2022 Increased flexibility for consumers.  Larger assort-\nments allow consumers to keep their options open \nand offer them greater flexibility when making a \nselection. Lack of variety might make consumers \nfeel that their choice is restricted by there being an \n inadequate number of options, which can create an \naura of negativity.\n\u2022 Increased opportunity to explore available \noptions.  The mere fact that a choice set contains \na large variety of options may convince consumers \nthat they have been given the chance to explore the \ncomplete roster of options available in the  product \ncategory. This gives them confidence that they \nunderstand the different features and benefits among \nthe choice alternatives before making a decision.\nThus there are impressive reasons why larger assort-\nments are likely to be of benefit to consumers, but this \nis not always true. In some instances, more options can \nhinder rather than facilitate consumers\u2019 ability to decide Among the decisions that managers at both manufacturers \nand retailers must make is how to design and manage their \nproduct lines and product assortments. Even though con -\nventional wisdom suggests that offering an extensive vari -\nety of options will be more beneficial and, therefore, more \nattractive to a greater number of consumers, it is also more \ncostly for the company. Research-backed  surveys indicate \nthat consumers prefer retailers and brands that offer the \ngreatest variety, so managers typically try to maximize the \nnumber of options offered to consumers within the cost \nconstraints imposed by the company.\nThere are several factors underlying the belief among \nmost managers that variety facilitates choice:\n\u2022 Increased ability to match preferences and \noptions.  Larger assortments offer an opportunity to \nbetter match consumer preferences with the options \navailable in the choice set. The more options con-\ntained in an assortment, the greater the chance that \nindividual consumers will find their optimal choice.When Less Is More\n( continued  )", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a3ffa55-902b-45ef-b17c-e96e9b2ff89b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a3ffa55-902b-45ef-b17c-e96e9b2ff89b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f9f9180-1da5-4286-acd3-ef472d1abc5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "93ab1c6a0e152b376608891c03a8ca7963b2357c3770f002e8ae264743cf762e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "109ea3c3-ff66-4482-b043-0de797b2fec4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "d33326636a6b56cd2d62b632b7edb864c750375e90aa185985d0fbf42843598f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5fd63c3-955a-45cc-a62c-4124e5500e84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a7d9dce94bd404674cc2cf324690f5e6a9dd228e2722ebabef3c1e65ac2c62e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "176 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nrelated to other products to ensure that a firm is offering \nthe optimal set of products to fulfill the needs of its dif-\nferent customer segments.\n5. A product portfolio encompasses all products offered \nby a company, including various product categories \nand product lines. A company\u2019s product portfolio has a \ncertain width, length, depth, and consistency. These four \ndimensions are the tools for developing the company\u2019s \nmarketing strategy and deciding which product lines to \ngrow and which to maintain, harvest, or divest.\n6. A product line is a group of related products sold by \nthe same company. A company\u2019s product line typically \ncontains products that appeal to different layers of \ncustomer needs. In offering a product line, companies \nnormally develop a basic platform and modules that \ncan be added to meet different customer requirements \nand lower production costs. To analyze a product line \nand decide how many resources to invest in it, product \nline managers need to look at sales, profits, and market \nprofile.summary\n1. The product is a key element of the marketing mix. \nAlong with services and brands, products are the core \ndrivers of customer benefits and are the reason why \nconsumers are willing to purchase a particular offering.\n2. To successfully compete in the market, products must \nbe differentiated. Attributes on the basis of which to \ndifferentiate include core functionality, features, perfor -\nmance quality, conformance quality, durability, reliabil -\nity, form, style, and customization.\n3. Product design\u2014the way a product looks, feels, and \nfunctions\u2014offers a potent way to differentiate and \n position a company\u2019s products and services. Design is \nnot just a phase in creating a product, service, or appli -\ncation. It\u2019s a way of thinking that permeates all aspects \nof the marketing program so that all design aspects \nwork together. Design offers functional and aesthetic \nbenefits and influences both the rational and the emo -\ntional aspects of consumers\u2019 decision making.\n4. Most products exist as a part of a company\u2019s product \nportfolio and/or product line. Each product must be marketing insight  (continued  )\namong the options. There are several reasons why this \ncan occur:\n\u2022 Information overload.  consumers choosing from \nlarge assortments can find themselves hampered \nby information overload, because they have to \n process more information than they have to consider \nwhen they choose from less extensive assortments. \n consumers often find it less taxing to deal with \nsmaller assortments simply because they have to \nconsider and evaluate fewer options and attributes.\n\u2022 Choice overload.  Larger assortments are more likely \nto lead to choice overload, which can occur when the \nconsumer finds more than one satisfactory option \nin the available choice set. This compounds the dif-\nficulty of making a decision: In addition to processing \na large amount of information, the consumer needs to \nmake a trade-off, giving up performance on one attri-\nbute in order to gain performance on another.\n\u2022 High consumer expectations.  Larger assortments \ncan complicate choice by leading consumers to expect \nthat they are likely to find the \u201cperfect\u201d option. When \nconsumers have high expectations of finding their ideal \nchoice among the available options but it fails to mate -\nrialize, there is a greater probability that they will walk \naway from the assortment without making a decision.\nAssembling the optimal assortment size from which \ntarget customers can choose is not a simple task. Some market conditions favor large assortments that will \nenhance consumer choice, whereas in other scenarios, \nlarger assortments may be detrimental to consumer \nchoice. The question that must be answered: When will \nmore or fewer options benefit consumer choice? Recent \nresearch suggests that consumers\u2019 reaction to assort-\nment size is dependent on their expertise, particularly \ntheir knowledge of the attributes and attribute levels of the \nchoice alternatives and the degree to which they already \nhave preferences among these options. This will allow \nthem to more easily trade off the benefits and costs of dif-\nferent option attributes.

The \ncompany transformed the way people listen to music, play \nvideo games, talk on the phone, and even read books. \nApple\u2019s revolutionary product innovations include the \niPod, iMac, iPhone, and iPad and are the reason why the \n company topped Fortune  magazine\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired \n companies list for many years.\n7.

The marketing effort appealed both to \nApple fans and to people who had not used Apple products \nin the past. To reach such a broad consumer base, the com-\npany had to shift its channel strategies. Apple added \u201cmass \nelectronic\u201d retailers such as Best Buy and (the now obsolete) \ncircuit city to its existing channels, which quadrupled its \nnumber of outlets.\nBesides this enhanced \u201cpush\u201d effort, Apple also devel-\noped memorable, creative \u201cpull\u201d advertising that helped drive \nthe popularity of the iPod. The Silhouettes, which featured \n silhouettes of people listening to and dancing with their \niPods, appeared all over the world. This simple message \nworked across cultures, portraying the iPod as cool but not \nbeyond the reach of anyone who enjoyed music.\nAs the iPod\u2019s popularity grew, a halo effect helped \nincrease the market share of Apple\u2019s other products. As a \nresult, in 2007 Apple officially changed its name from Apple \ncomputer Inc. to Apple Inc. to help communicate the com-\npany\u2019s expanded focus on non-computer products. Apple\u2019s \nnext-largest product launch after the iPod was the iPhone, \nits 2007 entry into the cell phone industry. The iPhone, with \nits touch-screen pad, virtual keyboard, and internet and \ne-mail capabilities, launched to huge consumer excitement: \nPeople lined up for hours to be among the first to buy one. \n Investment analysts initially feared that Apple\u2019s two-year \ncontract with AT&T and high initial price would hinder the \niPhone\u2019s success. Seventy-four days after the product\u2019s \ndebut, however, Apple had sold its one-millionth iPhone. \nIt\u00a0had taken the iPod two years to reach the cumulative sales \n($1.1 million) that the iPhone had reached in its first quarter. \nIn fact, half the iPod buyers switched to AT&T from a different \nwireless carrier, some incurring fees to break their contracts, \njust to have a chance to own an iPhone.\nThe launch of the iPad also created a media frenzy in \n2013. The multitouch device combined the look and feel of \nthe iPhone with the power of a MacBook and gave consum-\ners access to music, books, movies, pictures, video games, documents, and hundreds of thousands of applications at the \ntouch of a finger, without mouse or keyboard. Apple followed \nup with the launch of the iPad mini, a smaller version of the \noriginal, and the iPad Air, which corresponded with a power -\nful marketing campaign that inspired consumers to feel they \ncould do anything with their iPad, including creating mov-\nies, building wind turbines, studying coral reefs, and making \nmountain climbing safer.\nOn the heels of the success of the iPad, in 2015 Apple \nintroduced its first wearable device, Apple Watch, offering \nfitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities. After a slug -\ngish start, Apple Watch ultimately became one of Apple\u2019s \nfastest-growing product categories, selling over 30 million units \nin 2019. True to its mission of staying at the forefront of user-\nfriendly consumer technologies, Apple now invests heavily in \nartificial intelligence and machine learning. Indeed, in the past \nseveral years, the use of artificial intelligence in consumer prod -\nucts has exploded through the rise of digital assistants such as \nAmazon\u2019s Alexa, Google\u2019s Assistant, and Apple\u2019s own Siri.\nApple\u2019s investment in research and development is one \nway the company remains a leader in this cutthroat industry. \nApple spent over $18 billion on research and development \nin 2020 and continues to increase its R&D budget in order \nto stay ahead of the competition. creating, producing, and \nlaunching new products is a top priority for Apple.

The four founders particularly admired \nWarby Parker\u2019s success in offering designer sunglasses at \nradically low prices and its online sales model. By selling \nmattresses online, casper eliminated the traditional painful \nconsumer experience of purchasing a mattress in stores. \ncasper also distinguished its mattresses by offering them at \none-third of \u201cBig Mattress\u201d prices.\ncasper designed its first mattress to be the \u201cOne Perfect \nMattress for Everyone.\u201d The first casper mattress was com-\nposed of a resilient foam that could be compressed into the \nlargest box size that could be handled by UPS. The combina-\ntion of one mattress and a simple delivery method meant that \nconsumers had an easy decision-making process and the \ncompany enjoyed logistical benefits. casper also offered free \ndelivery and a 100-night free trial to customers.

To  create \nawareness for its product, casper first focused on word of \nmouth and outdoor advertising. The company invested in \nadvertisements that featured colorful ensembles of  cartoon \npeople and animals enjoying their sleep on a casper \n mattress. These advertisements were located on billboards, \nsubways, and taxis all over the country. casper\u2019s advertis-\ning imagery was designed to be playful and lighthearted, \nwhile also emphasizing the importance of a quality  mattress. \ncompared to competitors, casper was careful not to over -\nwhelm potential customers with excessive statistics and \nspecifications.\ncasper enjoyed rapid growth in sales after launch\u2014  \nearning over $600 million in revenue in three short years. \ncasper grew its product portfolio to include three different \ntypes of mattresses and began selling pillows, sheets, and \nbed frames to capture new customers. casper partnered with \nretailers such as Nordstrom, Target, and Amazon to increase \nits distribution.\nAs casper grew, the company shifted its advertising \nefforts to digital platforms.

Its plants can make as many \nas eight different models at the same time, effecting huge \nincreases in productivity and market responsiveness. Toyota \nalso innovates relentlessly. A typical Toyota assembly line \nmakes thousands of operational changes in the course of a \nsingle year. Toyota employees see their purpose as threefold: \nmaking cars, making cars better, and teaching everyone \nhow to make cars better. The company encourages problem \nsolving, always looking to improve the process by which it \nimproves all other processes.\nToyota has integrated its assembly plants around the \nworld into a single giant network. The plants customize cars \nfor local markets and shift production quickly to satisfy any \nsurges in demand from markets worldwide. With its manu-\nfacturing network, Toyota can build a wide variety of models \nmuch more inexpensively. That means the company is able \nto fill market niches as they emerge without building entirely \nnew assembly operations. This, in turn, has enabled the \ncompany to establish a foothold across a variety of diverse \nmarket segments.\nOver the years, Toyota\u2019s automobiles have consis-\ntently ranked high in quality and reliability. The company \nsuffered some major challenges in 2009 and 2010 when it Toyota\nToyota, one of the world\u2019s three largest automakers (along \nwith Renault Nissan and Volkswagen), has come a long way \nover the course of its 75-year history. The company launched \nits first passenger car, the Model AA, in 1936. For it, Toyota \ncopied the body design of chrysler\u2019s landmark Airflow and \nmodeled its engine after a 1933 chevrolet engine. Toyota \nsuffered several challenges in its early years, including a \nfinancial crisis in 1950. However, during the oil crisis of 1973, \nconsumers wanted smaller, more fuel-efficient automobiles. \nToyota answered with two smaller cars\u2014the Toyota corona \nand Toyota corolla\u2014that came with basic features and also \nacted as Toyota\u2019s new entry-level vehicles. The company also \nlaunched the Toyota cressida, which combined the fuel effi-\nciency consumers desired with additional space and luxury \namenities such as air conditioning and an AM\u2013FM radio.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Toyota gradually added \nmore types of vehicles, ranging widely in price, size, and \namenities, in order to give customers more options to fit their \ndriving needs. In 1982 Toyota introduced the camry, a four-\ndoor, mid-sized car that offered consumers more space than \nthe corona. The camry would go on to become the best-\nselling passenger car in North America. The first of Toyota\u2019s \npopular SUVs was introduced with the 4Runner in 1984. At \nfirst the 4Runner wasn\u2019t much different from Toyota\u2019s pickup \ntrucks in both design and performance. Eventually, however, \nthe 4Runner morphed into looking more like a passenger \nvehicle and led the way for the launch of other SUVs, includ-\ning the Rav4, Highlander, and Land cruiser. Around the same \ntime, Toyota introduced a full-sized pickup truck, which later \nbecame today\u2019s Tundra, as well as several sporty and afford-\nable cars that targeted young adults.\nIn 1989, Toyota launched Lexus, its luxury division. \nLexus promised to give consumers an unparalleled luxuri-\nous experience, starting with the dealerships, which offered \nwhite-glove treatment. Toyota understood, however, that \neach country defines perfection differently. In the United \nStates, perfection and luxury meant comfort, size, and \ndependability.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "076e1ca2-4a84-4e7e-a473-46371903f5d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "076e1ca2-4a84-4e7e-a473-46371903f5d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4124e780-7dcc-463e-ad24-99b4d8719dce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "584baa2f372a22c6ae09f48786ada12714f3d433f3af98cbd5e8ac25fd351eff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8ad4907-ef2f-45d8-9e5f-3393bf5868b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap8.pdf"}, "hash": "5d68336678ebd53f5a778298059a041a9a6ec02bd347ee6433cf1d498ab0be77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5cbbd699-de6d-430d-a306-c5bae6ff2b8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d043ffdc8bdb7e77aa0d4c1682eb643bab6e54481cfff3ed07c19889df374bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At \nfirst the 4Runner wasn\u2019t much different from Toyota\u2019s pickup \ntrucks in both design and performance.
