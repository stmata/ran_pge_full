Consumer behaviour, in its\nbroadest sense, is concerned with how\nconsumers select and use goods and services.Consumer behaviour\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nConsumer behaviour  is the study of individuals, groups, or\norganizations and the processes they use to select, secure,\nuse, and dispose of products, services, experiences, or ideas\nto satisfy their needs and wants. It is also concerned with the\nsocial and economic impacts that purchasing and\nconsumption behaviour has on both the consumer and wider\nsociety.[1] Consumer behaviour blends elements from\npsychology, sociology, social anthropology, marketing and\neconomics, especially behavioural economics. It examines\nhow emotions, attitudes and preferences affect buying\nbehaviour. Characteristics of individual consumers such as\ndemographics, personality lifestyles and behavioural variables\nsuch as usage rates, usage occasion, loyalty, brand advocacy,\nwillingness to provide referrals, in an attempt to understand\npeople's wants and consumption are all investigated in formal\nstudies of consumer behaviour. The study of consumer behaviour also inves tigates the influences, on the consumer,\nfrom groups such as family, friends, sports, reference groups, and society i n general.[2][3]\nThe study of consumer behaviour is concerned with all aspects of purchas ing behaviour - from pre-purchase\nactivities through to post-purchase consumption and evaluation activ ities. It is also concerned with all persons\ninvolved, either directly or indirectly, in purchasing decisions and con sumption activities including brand-influencers\nand opinion leaders. Research has shown that consumer behaviour is diffi cult to predict, even for experts in the\nfield.[4] However, new research methods such as ethnography and consumer neuros cience are shedding new light\non how consumers make decisions.\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) databases have become an as set for the analysis of customer behaviour.\nThe voluminous data produced by these databases enables detailed examinat ion of behavioural factors that\ncontribute to customer re-purchase intentions, consumer retention, l oyalty and other behavioural intentions such as\nthe willingness to provide positive referrals, become brand advocates or en gage in customer citizenship activities.\nDatabases also assist in market segmentation, especially behaviour al segmentation such as developing loyalty\nsegments, which can be used to develop tightly targeted, customized marke ting strategies on a one-to-one basis.\n(Also see relationship marketing)\nContents\n1 The purchase decision and its context\n2 Overview of the consumer's purchase decision process\n2.1 Problem recognition\n2.2 Information Search and Evaluation of Alternatives\n2.3 Purchase decision\n2.4 Post-purchase evaluation", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2857, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "148eead1-6e27-4497-be93-f6d9cce678e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "148eead1-6e27-4497-be93-f6d9cce678e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02299c51-a045-4d0c-980b-b0896820b053", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "2b2add80583d6a0ebfcf960665dc5f727d6ee7c608d30f9a3ae71929c0f1a812", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc7e318d-a980-49a9-be2d-ccaaeacec5ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "a3ecabd55ed7f727e8564f722d93bb6c47b5f183d7807981b13f2abc8a2749fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5dd5e04-37b9-49fd-8304-a68ff3e03012", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52393d9d663f8d365ba564272b36add6c6a53adedb7405d29e2aa17ec6511da8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Shoppers inspect the quality of fresh\nproduce at a market in Jerusalem.2.5 Internal influences on purchase decision\n2.5.1 Motivations and Emotions\n2.5.2 Perception\n2.5.3 Prior Experience\n2.6 External influences on purchase decision\n2.6.1 Culture\n2.6.2 Subcultures\n2.6.3 Social Class\n2.6.4 Reference groups\n3 Consumer decision styles\n4 Other topics in consumer behaviour\n4.1 Risk perception and risk reduction activities\n4.2 New product adoption and diffusion of innovations\n4.3 Brand-switching\n4.4 Channel-switching\n4.5 Impulse buying\n4.6 Affect: Emotions, feelings and mood\n4.6.1 Information search\n4.6.2 Choice\n4.6.3 Customer satisfaction\n4.6.4 Advertising\n4.7 Customer loyalty\n4.8 Customer citizenship behaviour\n5 Research methods used\n5.1 Ethnographic research\n5.2 Consumer neuroscience\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 Further reading\nThe purchase decision and its context\nUnderstanding purchasing and consumption behaviour is a key challenge\nfor marketers.

When a purchase decision is made by a small group, such as a h ousehold, different members of the\ngroup may become involved at different stages of the decision process and ma y perform different roles. For\nexample, one person may search for information while another may physic ally go to the store, buy the product and\ntransport it home. It is customary to think about the types of decision roles;  such as:\nThe Initiator\nthe person who proposes a brand (or product) for\nconsideration(something in return);\nThe Influencer\nsomeone who recommends a given brand;\nThe Decider\nthe person who makes the ultimate purchase decision;\nThe Purchaser\nthe one who orders or physically buys it;\nThe User\nthe person who uses or consumes the product.[6]\nFor most purchase decisions, each of the decision roles must be\nperformed, but not always by the same individual. For example, in the\ncase of family making a decision about a dining-out venue, the mother\nmay initiate the process by intimating that she is too tired to cook, the\nchildren are important influencers in the overall purchase decisi on, but\nboth parents may act as joint deciders performing a gate-keeping role by ve toing unacceptable alternatives and\nencouraging more acceptable alternatives. The importance of childre n as influencers in a wide range of purchase\ncontexts should never be underestimated and the phenomenon is known as pest er power.[7]\nTo understand the mental processes used in purchasing decisions, some\nauthors employ the concept of the \"black box\"; a figurative term used to\ndescribe the cognitive and affective processes used by a consumer durin g\na purchase decision. The decision model situates the black box in a\nbroader environment which shows the interaction of external and inte rnal\nstimuli (e.g.consumer characteristics, situational factors, mar keting\ninfluences and environmental factors) as well as consumer respons es.[8]\nThe black box model is related to the black box theory of behaviourism,\nwhere the focus extends beyond processes occurring inside  the\nconsumer, and also includes the relation  between the stimuli and the\nconsumer's response.\nThe decision model assumes that purchase decisions do not occur in a\nvacuum. Rather they occur in real time and are affected by other stim uli,\nincluding external environmental stimuli and the consumer's mom entary\nsituation. The elements of the model include: interpersonal stimuli\n(between people) or intrapersonal stimuli (within people), environment al\nstimuli and marketing stimuli.[9] Marketing stimuli include actions planned and carried out by companies, w hereas", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2898, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82ec31e5-a4ce-41ca-84c8-d86b48154c42": {"__data__": {"id_": "82ec31e5-a4ce-41ca-84c8-d86b48154c42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "703b4d38-0b52-44e0-921a-e8cba609b107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "8c41af8992fa30dc4225f09167bca7969eee1fc21d70cf067a6a222636b7b6d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5dd5e04-37b9-49fd-8304-a68ff3e03012", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "275a382e405db10bfa47ac4a4bc9bd70f21d72ac38eb3945d3f54293b3f19d65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af5b64c0-45b4-4029-ad53-9e56e93890c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "158eef060a353c5db33d8c92db97d6bc2ec558f0faeacd1f5e4d560edb381a62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The purchase of up-market perfumes,\noften bought as gifts, are high\ninvolvement decisions because the\ngift symbolises the relationship\nbetween the giver and the intended\nrecipientenvironmental stimuli include actions or events occurring in the  wider operating environment and include social\nfactors, economic, political and cultural dimensions. In addition, the buyer 's black box includes buyer characteristics\nand the decision process, which influence the buyer's responses.\nThe black box model considers the buyer's response as a result of a\nconscious, rational decision process, in which it is assumed that the buy er\nhas recognized a problem, and seeks to solve it through a commercial\npurchase. In practice some purchase decisions, such as those made\nroutinely or habitually, are not driven by a strong sense of problem-\nsolving. Such decisions are termed low-involvement  and are\ncharacterized by relatively low levels of information search/ eva luation\nactivities. In contrast, high involvement  decisions require a serious\ninvestment of time and effort in the search/ evaluation process.[10] Low\ninvolvement products are typically those that carry low levels of\neconomic or psycho-social risk. High involvement products are those that\ncarry higher levels of risk and are often expensive, infrequent\npurchases.[11] Regardless of whether the consumer faces a high or low\ninvolvement purchase, he or she needs to work through a number of\ndistinct stages of a decision process.\nOverview of the consumer's purchase\ndecision process\nThe consumer buying process is usually depicted as consisting of 5 distin ct stages:[12]\nThe purchase decision begins with the problem recognition  stage which occurs when the consumer identifies a\nneed, typically defined as the difference between the consumer's cur rent state and their desired state. The strength\nof the need drives the entire decision process. Information search  describes the phase where consumers scan both\ntheir internal memory and external sources for information about produc ts or brands that will potentially satisfy their\nneed. The aim of the information search is to identify a list of options tha t represent realistic purchase options.\nThroughout the entire process, the consumer engages in a series of me ntal evaluations of alternatives , searching\nfor the best value. Towards the end of the evaluation stage, consumers for m a purchase intention, which may or\nmay not translate into an actual product purchase .[12] Even when consumers decide to proceed with an actual\npurchase, the decision-process is not complete until the consumer consu mes or experiences the product and\nengages in a final post purchase evaluation ; a stage in which the purchaser's actual experience of the product i s\ncompared with the expectations formed during the information search an d evaluation stages. The stages of the\ndecision process normally occur in a fixed sequence.[13] However it should be noted that information search and\nevaluation can occur throughout the entire decision process, includin g post-purchase.\nProblem recognition\nThe first stage of the purchase decision process begins with problem recognition  (also known as category need or\nneed arousal). This is when the consumer identifies a need, typically  defined as the difference between the\nconsumer's current state and their desired or ideal state. A simpler w ay of thinking about problem recognition is that\nit is where the consumer decides that he or she is 'in the market' for a  product or service to satisfy some need or\nwant.

Alternative ly, evaluation may occur continuously throughout\nthe entire decision process. The fact that a consumer is aware of a bran d does not necessarily mean that it is being\nconsidered as a potential purchase. For instance, the consumer may be awa re of certain brands, but not favorably\ndisposed towards them (known as the inept set ). Such brands will typically be excluded from further evaluation as\npurchase options. For other brands, the consumer may have indifferent fee lings (the inert set ).[17] As the consumer\napproaches the actual purchase, he or she distills the mental list of br ands into a set of alternatives that represent\nrealistic purchase options, known as the consideration set .[18] By definition, the consideration set refers to the\n\u201csmall set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when makin g a purchase decision\u201d.[19]\nTraditionally, one of the main roles of advertising and promotion was to\nincrease the likelihood that a brand name was included in the consumer' s\nevoked set.[20] Repeated exposure to brand names through intensive\nadvertising was the primary method for increasing top-of-mind brand\nawareness . However, the advent of the Internet means that consumers\ncan obtain brand/product information from a multiplicity of different\nplatforms. In practice, this means that the consideration set has ass umed\ngreater importance. The implication for marketers is that relevant  brand\ninformation should be disseminated as widely as possible and included on\nany forum where consumers are likely to search for product or brand\ninformation. Thus, marketers require a rich understanding of the typic al\nconsumer's touchpoints.\nConsumers evaluate alternatives in terms of the functional  and psycho-social  benefits offered.[21] Functional\nbenefits are the tangible outcomes that can be experienced by the consu mer such as taste or appearance. Psycho-\nsocial benefits are the more abstract outcomes such as the social cur rency that might accrue from wearing an\nexpensive suit or driving a 'hot' car. Brand image is an important psych o-social attribute. Consumers have both\npositive and negative beliefs about a given brand.[22] Consumer beliefs may differ depending on the consumer's\nprior experience and the effects of selective perception, distortion and r etention.\nThe marketing organization needs a deep understanding of the benefits m ost valued by consumers and therefore\nwhich attributes are most important in terms of the consumer's purch ase decision. It also needs to monitor other\nbrands in the customer\u2019s consideration set to optimise planning for its ow n brand.\nDuring the evaluation of alternatives, the consumer ranks or asses ses the relative merits of different options\navailable. No universal evaluation process is used by consumers across  all-buying situations.[23] Instead, consumers\ngenerate different evaluation criteria depending on each unique buy ing situation. Thus the relevant attributes vary\naccording to each product category and across different types of consumers . For example, attributes important for\nevaluating a restaurant would include food quality, price, location, atmos phere, quality of service and menu\nselection. Consumers, depending on their geographic, demographic, psychogra phic and behavioural characteristics,\nwill decide which attributes are important to them. After evaluatin g the different product attributes, the consumer\nranks each attribute from highly important to least important.

Sometimes\npurchase intention does not translate into an actual purchase. The ex tent to which purchase intentions result in actual\nsales is known as the sales conversion  rate.[25]\nOrganizations use a variety of techniques to improve conversion rate s.\nThe provision of easy credit or payment terms may encourage purchase.\nSales promotions such as the opportunity to receive a premium or enter a\ncompetition may provide an incentive to buy now rather than later.\nAdvertising messages with a strong call-to-action  are yet another device\nused to convert customers.[26] A call-to-action is any device designed to\nencourage immediate sale.[27] Typically, a call-to-action includes specific\nwording in an advertisement or selling pitch that employs imperative  verbs\nsuch as \"Buy now\" or \"Don't wait\". Other types of calls-to-action migh t\nprovide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately suc h\nan offer that is only available for a limited time (e.g. 'Offer must ex pire\nsoon'; 'Limited stocks available') or a special deal usually accompanie d\nby a time constraint (e.g. 'Order before midnight to receive a free gift  with\nyour order'; 'Two for the price of one for first 50 callers only'). The key\nto a powerful call-to-action is to provide consumers with compelling\nreasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions.\nAs consumers approach the actual purchase decision, they are more likel y to rely on personal sources of\ninformation.[28] For this reason, personal sales representatives must be well versed i n giving sales pitches and in\ntactics used close the sale. Methods used might include: \u2018social evide nce\u2019, where the salesperson refers to previous\nsuccess and satisfaction from other customers buying the product. \u2018Sca rcity attraction\u2019 is another technique, where\nthe salesperson mentions that the offer is limited, as it forces the c onsumer to make a quicker decision, and\ntherefore less time evaluating alternatives.[29]\nPost-purchase evaluation\nFollowing purchase and after experiencing the product or service, the c onsumer enters the final stage, namely post-\npurchase evaluation. The consumer's purchase and post-purchase acti vities have the potential to provide important\nfeedback to marketers.[30] Foxall (2005) suggested that post-purchase evaluation provides key feedback be cause\nit influences future purchase patterns and consumption activitie s.[31]\nThe post purchase stage is where the consumer examines and comparies  product features, such as price,\nfunctionality, and quality with their expectations.[32] Post purchase evaluation can be viewed as the steps taken by\nconsumers to correlate their expectations with perceived value, and t hus influences the consumer\u2019s next purchase\ndecision for that good or service.[33] For example, if a consumer buys a new phone and his or her post-purchase\nevaluation is positive, he/she will be encouraged to purchase the same  brand or from the same company in the\nfuture. This is also known as \"post-purchase intention\".[34] On the contrary, if a consumer is dissatisfied with the\nnew phone, he or she may take actions to resolve the dissatisfaction.

Post-decision dissonance  (also known as cognitive dissonance ) is the term used\nto describe feelings of anxiety that occur in the post purchase stage;  and refers to the consumer's uneasy feelings or\nconcerns as to whether or not the correct decision was made at purchase.[35] Some consumers, for instance, may\nregret that they did not purchase one of the other brands they were conside ring.This type of anxiety can affect\nconsumers' subsequent behaviour\nConsumers use a number of strategies to reduce post purchase dissonance . A typical strategy is to look to peers or\nsignificant others for validation of the purchase choice. Marketing c ommunications can also be used to remind\nconsumers that they made a wise choice by purchasing Brand X.[36]\nWhen consumers make unfavorable comparisons between the chosen option an d the options forgone, they may feel\npost-decision regret or buyer's remorse. Consumers can also feel short- term regret when they avoid making a\npurchase decision, however this regret can dissipate over time. Throug h their experiences consumers can learn and\nalso engage in a process that\u2019s called hypothesis testing . This refers to the formation of hypotheses about the\nproducts or a service through prior experience or word of mouth communication s. There are four stages that\nconsumers go through in the hypothesis testing: Hypothesis generat ion, exposure of evidence, encoding of evidence\nand integration of evidence.\nInternal influences on purchase decision\nPurchasing behaviour is also influenced by a range of internal infl uences such as psychological, demographic and\npersonality factors. Demographic factors include income level, psychog raphics (lifestyle), age, occupation and\nsocio-economic status. Personality factors include knowledge, attitude s, personal values, beliefs, emotions and\nfeelings. Psychological factors include an individual's motivation , attitudes, personal values and beliefs. Other factors\nthat may affect the purchase decision include the environment and t he consumer's prior experience with the category\nor brand.\nMotivations and Emotions\nThe consumer's underlying motivation drives consumer action, inclu ding information search and the purchase\ndecision. The consumer's attitude to a brand (or brand preference ) is described as a link between the brand and a\npurchase motivation.[37] These motivations may be negative - that is to avoid pain or unpleasantn ess, or positive -\nthat is to achieve some type of sensory gratification.[38]\nOne approach to understanding motivations, was developed by Abraham Maslow. Ma slow's hierarchy of needs is\nbased on five levels of needs, organized accordingly to the level of importan ce.\nMaslow's five needs are:[36]\nPhysiological\nbasic levels of needs such as food, water and sleep\nSafety\nthe need for physical safety, shelter and security\nBelonging\nthe need for love, friendship and also a desire for group acceptance\nEsteem", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cafcb110-b122-43aa-8556-ad5f762945e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "cafcb110-b122-43aa-8556-ad5f762945e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "89ce30e2-5abe-4fac-be26-b3b7d8910990", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "c4179630bbb6959291075cc0edd3a3e24d36a6a559fa1aab687c263526cb0e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94f814e1-c54a-461c-9f8c-6650408198d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "ae42046ffbe02e4837b2e3476da6d68e7b0097e7631b336c7863db8531f86e90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab6ea6a5-a953-4507-a822-64abf3c5b685", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4530e1d69d1fc5f76790d4000fb3ab120b5e806efab5bfae62d419464e46dab9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Maslow's hierarchy suggests\nthat people seek to satisfy\nbasic needs such as food and\nshelter before higher order\nneeds become meaningful\nA decision to purchase an analgesic\npreparation is motivated by the desire\nto avoid pain (negative motivation)The need for status, recognition and self-respect\nSelf-actualization\nThe desire for self-fulfillment (e.g. personal growth, artistic expr ession)\nPhysiological needs and safety needs are the so-called lower order needs .\nConsumers typically use most of their resources (time, energy and fi nances)\nattempting to satisfy these lower order needs before the higher order ne eds of\nbelonging, esteem and self-actualization become meaningful.

The perception process is\nwhere individuals receive, organize and interpret information in orde r to\nattribute some meaning. Perception involves three distinct processe s:\nsensing information, selecting information and interpreting infor mation.\nSensation is also part of the perception process, and it is linked direct\nwith responses from the senses creating some reaction towards the bra nd\nname, advertising and packaging. The process of perception is uniquely\nindividual and may depend on a combination of internal and external\nfactors such as experiences, expectations, needs and the momentary se t.\nWhen exposed to a stimulus, consumers may respond in entirely different\nways due to individual perceptual processes.[36] A number of processes\npotentially support or interfere with perception. Selective exposure\noccurs when consumers decide whether to be exposed to information\ninputs. Selective attention  occurs when consumers focus on some\nmessages to the exclusion of others. Selective comprehension  is where the consumer interprets information in a\nmanner that is consistent with their own beliefs. Selective retention  occurs when consumers remember some\ninformation while rapidly forgetting other information.[44] Collectively the processes of selective exposure, attention,\ncomprehension and retention lead individual consumers to favor certain  messages over others. The way that\nconsumers combine information inputs to arrive at a purchase decision i s known as integration .[45]\nMarketers are interested in consumer perceptions of brands, packaging, produ ct formulations, labeling and pricing.\nOf special interest is the threshold of perception  (also known as the just noticeable difference ) in a stimulus. For\nexample, how much should a marketer lower a price before consumers recogni ze it as a bargain?[46] In addition,\nmarketers planning to enter global markets need to be aware of cultural di fferences in perception.[47] For example,\nwesterners associate the color white with purity, cleanliness an d hygiene, but in eastern countries white is often\nassociated with mourning and death. Accordingly, white packaging would be a n inappropriate color choice for food\nlabels on products to be marketed in Asia.\nPrior Experience\nThe consumer's prior experience with the category, product or brand can ha ve a major bearing on purchase\ndecision-making. Experienced consumers (also called experts) are more  sophisticated consumers; they tend to be\nmore skillful information searchers, canvass a broader range of inform ation sources and use complex heuristics to\nevaluate purchase options. Novice consumers, on the other hand, are less e fficient information searchers and tend\nto perceive higher levels of purchase risk on account of their unfamil iarity with the brand or category.

Cult ure refers to the complexity of learning\nmeanings, values, norms, and customs shared by members of a society. Cultu ral norms are relatively stable over\ntime, therefore, culture has a major impact on consumer behaviour. Marke ters interested in global expansion are\nespecially interested in understanding cross-cultural differen ces in purchasing and consumption. For instance,\nFerrari, one of the world's top brands found that Chinese consumers are ver y different from their Western\ncounterparts. Whereas consumers in the US, UK and Australia expect t o wait 12 months for a custom-made\nFerrari, prospective Chinese buyers want to drive the vehicle off the  showroom floor. China is an \u2018instant-\ngratification market\u2019. Buyers see their friends riding around in a l uxury car and want to have the same as quickly as\npossible. To meet the growing demand for luxury goods, Ferrari and other luxur y car makers have been forced to\nmodify their production processes for Asian markets.[50]\nSubcultures\nSubcultures may be based on age, geographic, religious, racial, and\nethnic differences. More often, however, a subculture occurs when\npeople with shared interests form a loose-knit group with a distinctive\nidentity (sometimes called consumer tribes ). Members of subcultures are\nself-selected, and signal their membership status by adopting symbols,\nrituals or behaviours that are widely understood by other members of the\ntribe (e.g. a dress code, hairstyle or even a unique way of speaking). For\nexample, within youth culture it is possible to identify a number of sub-\ngroups with common interests such as skaters and bladers, surfers,\nravers, punks, skin-heads, Goths, homies and others.\nA different type of subculture is a consumption subculture  which is\nbased on a shared commitment to a common brand or product. In other\nwords, consumption subcultures cut across demographic, geographic and\nsocial boundaries. The most well-known example of a consumption\nsubculture is that of Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners. Ethnographi c researchers who have studied Harley riders\nbelieve that there are only two types of motor cyclists, Harley owners a nd the rest.[51] Harley-Davidson has\nleveraged the values of this subculture by establishing the Harle y Owners Group (HOG).[52]\nSubcultures are important to marketers for several reasons.

In Australia, for\nexample, the AB socio-economic group account for just 24% of the population, but con trol 50% of discretionary\nspending.[53] The top quintiles (i.e. AB socio-economic segments) are of particular in terest to marketers of luxury\ngoods and services such as travel, dining-out, entertainment, luxury  cars, investment or wealth management\nservices, up-market consumer electronics and designer labels (e.g. Lou is Vuitton).\nReference groups\nA reference group is defined as \"a group whose presumed perspectives or val ues are being used by an individual as\nthe basis for his or her judgment, opinions, and actions.\" Reference groups a re important because they are used to\nguide an individual\u2019s attitudes, beliefs and values.[39] Insights into how consumers acquire a given value system can\nobtained from an understanding of group influence and group socialisation pr ocesses.\nThe literature identifies five broad types of reference group; primar y, secondary, aspirational, dissociative and\nformal:\nPrimary groups : groups, such as family, that exert a strong influence on attitudes a nd behaviours\nSecondary groups : groups such as clubs, societies, sports teams, political parties, religi ons that align with a\nperson's ideas or values, but exert a less fundamental influence on th e formation of attitudes and behaviours\nAspirational groups  groups to which an individual does not currently belong, but possibly aspires t o\nbecome a member because the group possesses characteristics which ar e admired.\nDisassociative reference groups  - a group which has a negative image; individuals may disapprove of the\ndisassociative group's values, attitudes or behaviours and may seek to dis tance themselves from such\ngroups.[35]\nOpinion Leaders  can act like reference groups in that they exert considerable social  influence because of their\nproduct knowledge, expertise and credibility. In the marketing literatur e, opinion leaders are also known as\ninfluencers, mavens and even hubs.[54] Opinion leaders are specific to a product category, so that an opinion leader\nfor computers is not likely to be an opinion leader for fashion.

Some techniques that can be\nused are through key informants, socio-metric techniques and self-que stionnaires.[56] More often, however,\nmarketers use gut instinct to identify opinion leaders.

Marketers of cosmetics and skincare preparations regular ly provide fashion editors with free samples in\nthe hope that their products will be mentioned in fashion magazines.\nConsumer decision styles\nA number of theorist have argued that certain fundamental decision- making styles can be identified.[57][58] A\ndecision-making style is defined as a \"mental orientation characte rising a consumer's approach to making\nchoices.\"[59] Sproles and Kendall (1986) developed a consumer style inventory (CSI) consis ting of eight factors,\nsuch as price-sensitivity, quality-consciousness, brand-conscious ness, novelty-seeking, fashion-consciousness and\nhabit. Based on these factors, the authors developed a typology of eight distin ct decision-making styles:[60]\nQuality conscious/Perfectionist : Quality-consciousness is\ncharacterised by a consumer\u2019s search for the very best quality in\nproducts; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically\nmaking more comparisons and shopping around.\nBrand-conscious : Brand-consciousness is characterised by a\ntendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels.\nThose who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that\nthe higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a\npreference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.\nRecreation-conscious/ Hedonistic : Recreational shopping is\ncharacterised by the consumer\u2019s engagement in the purchase\nprocess. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness\nregard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.\nPrice-conscious : A consumer who exhibits price-and-value\nconsciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around\nseeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by\nobtaining the best value for money\nNovelty/fashion-conscious : characterised by a consumer\u2019s\ntendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the\nsake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; t hey like to keep up-to-date with fashions\nand trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.\nImpulsive : Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase dec isions, buy on the spur of the\nmoment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining  value.

As successive\ngroups of consumers adopt the\ninnovation(shown in blue), its market\nshare (yellow) will eventually reach\nsaturation levelWithin consumer behaviour, a particular area of interest is the stu dy of how innovative new products, services, ideas\nor technologies spread through groups. Insights about how innovations are di ffused (i.e., spread) through\npopulations can assist marketers to speed up the new product adoption process and f ine-tune the marketing\nprogram at different stages of the diffusion process. In addition, diffusion  models provide benchmarks against which\nnew product introductions can be tracked.\nA sizeable body of literature has been devoted to the diffusion of\ninnovation.[73] Research studies tend to fall into two broad categories;\ngeneral diffusion research - an approach that seeks to understand the\ngeneral process of diffusion and applied diffusion research - studies tha t\ndescribe the diffusion of specific products at particular moments in tim e\nor within given social communities.[74] Collectively these studies suggest a\ncertain regularity in the adoption process; initially few members a dopt the\ninnovation but over time, successive, overlapping waves of people begin\nto adopt the innovation.[75] This pattern contributes to a generalised S-\nshaped curve, as shown in the figure at right. However, the exact shape\nand timing of curves varies in different product markets such that som e\ninnovations are diffused relatively quickly, while others can take ma ny\nyears to achieve broad market acceptance.\nThe diffusion model developed by Everett Rogers is widely used in\nconsumer marketing because it segments consumers into five groups,\nbased on their rate of new product adoption.[76] Rogers defines the diffusion of innovation as the process by which\nthat innovation is \"communicated through certain channels over ti me among the members of a social system.\"[77]\nThus the diffusion process has a number of elements, the innovation, the  communication channels, time and the\nsocial system. An innovation is any new idea, object or process that is perc eived as new by members of the social\nsystem. Communication channels are the means by which information  about the innovation is transmitted to\nmembers of the social system and may include mass media, digital media a nd personal communications between\nmembers of the social system. Time refers to the rate at which the in novation is picked up by the members of the\nsocial system.\nTable 1:Adopter Categories[78]", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2559, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6612ffbf-72a2-40dd-9286-62c7e81d01b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6612ffbf-72a2-40dd-9286-62c7e81d01b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57325731-c4a4-4da1-8d66-fd7ad92c6f12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "40f42546cb7d461f5bf14a21b50e099d6492b1fca0024078428abebcaf7cb746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "116ff84e-2800-4b11-8169-d6c09c3ecb65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "b432b92854aca51355b9041c21b5b18b75777317b4485376ff9f2463c578686b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c10ec51-4534-486e-86aa-e51768ce9328", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bcf2e7be0f893501fa0bbd61001ab0b3aa1ecc178a324ff10c9307268d1ed21b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Adopter\nGroupProportion of All\nAdoptersPsycho-social and Demographic Characteristics\nInnovators 2.5%adopt new products or concepts well ahead of the social community\nventuresome;

Rossiter and Bellman have proposed a classification of consu mers based on brand-loyalty/ switching\nbehaviour:[85]\nBrand Loyals\nPurchase preferred brand on almost every purchase occasion\nFavourable Brand Switchers\nExhibit moderate preference for the brand or brands that they buy and can be r eadily enticed to purchase\ncompeting brands", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2938, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a834e18-3170-4fe3-8e39-f31f1de4c068": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a834e18-3170-4fe3-8e39-f31f1de4c068", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4859fe0-07c4-4e8a-9741-bb72a57b4140", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "18b604bdaede9d081b2996cba9ed3e51c94cdfe1cd1dfaadfc59d886135f584f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c10ec51-4534-486e-86aa-e51768ce9328", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "f755087bc9e6e948e210a174e2b8a867d61b4fc8af4f7e683fe1caa8e9e59cbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc2d8066-9e11-445c-9832-51cb779b3510", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea402270f88aa69fcc64e864b8ffcc71e77cf76cabca7bf5912ff4a5637b27b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The advent of \"category killers\", such\nas Australia's Officeworks, has\ncontributed to an increase in channel\nswitching behaviourOther Brand Switchers\nNormally purchase a competing brand, possibly because they are unaware of  our brand or due to a negative\nexperience with our brand\nNew Category Users\nThose who are unaware of a category but have potential to become new users\nMarketers are particularly interested in understanding the fact ors that lead to brand-switching. A global, large\nsample survey carried out by Nielsen shows that four in 10 shoppers (41%) sai d that getting a better price would\nencourage them to switch brands (or service provider/retailer); 26% sa id quality was an incentive to switch; 15%\nlooked for a better service agreement and 8% said that improved features ar e a switching incentive.[86] However, it\nshould be noted that cross-cultural differences were observed among res pondents. Price was the major switch\nincentive for more than half of North Americans (61%) and Europeans (54%)  but price and quality held equal sway\nin Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa, with roughly one-third of re spondents each in both regions reporting that\nboth price and quality were the major incentives to switching.\nThe concept of switching costs  (also known as switching barriers) is pertinent to the understanding  of brand\nswitching. Switching costs refer to the costs incurred by a consumer  when he or she switches from one supplier to\nanother (or from one brand to another). Although switching costs are often  monetary, the concept can also refer to\npsychological costs such as time, effort and inconvenience incurred a s a result of switching. When switching costs\nare relatively low, as in the case of many fast moving consumer goods (F MCG), the incidence of brand switching\ntends to be higher. An example of switching that includes both monetary a nd psychological costs is when Android\nor Apple users wish to switch to a different platform, they would need to sacr ifice their data, including purchased\nmusic tracks, apps or media and may also need to learn new routines to become an  efficient user.\nChannel-switching\nChannel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfin g on\nTV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing\nenvironment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as\nswitching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the\ninternet.[87] A number of factors have led to an increase in channel\nswitching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of\nmarkets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R\nUs) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For in stance, in\nAustralia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting\nsupermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually\nswitching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the\npurchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and\ncomplementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.[88]\nFor the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping expe rience. However, marketers need to be\nalert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market sha re. Evidence of channel switching can suggest\nthat disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is under going fundamental changes. A consumer may\nbe prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheape r, when superior models become\navailable, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more conv enient to shop through a different channel\n(e.g. online or one-stop shopping).[89] As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some\nretailers engage in multi-channel retailing.[90]", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3776, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc2d8066-9e11-445c-9832-51cb779b3510": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc2d8066-9e11-445c-9832-51cb779b3510", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4603b03a-520a-4a5f-8f42-545253213194", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "f02af3c0688e59620dba4892995a1203889f0dd4e2a7f4bd895b210025b6598a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a834e18-3170-4fe3-8e39-f31f1de4c068", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "18b604bdaede9d081b2996cba9ed3e51c94cdfe1cd1dfaadfc59d886135f584f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a88d3ce1-eb52-4d04-9d86-2ca4303b9482", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "225f4f5f98250f3a449bf61ea7e2c4a20d024d4da6eb1e04b5ed2062224548b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Large family-sized cakes are more\nlikely to be a planned purchase, while\nthe individual portions are much more\nlikely to be an unplanned purchaseImpulse buying\nImpulse purchases are unplanned purchases. Impulse buying can be defin ed as \u201ca sudden and powerful urge to buy\nimmediately\u201d and occurs when a consumer purchases an item which th ey had no intention of purchasing prior to\nentering the store.[91] Impulse buying can be influenced by external stimuli such as store c haracteristics and sale\npromotions, internal stimuli such as enjoyment and self-identity, si tuational and product related factors such as time\nand money available, and demographic and socio-cultural factors such as g ender, age, and education.[92] Stern\nintroduced the four broad classifications of impulse buying including pur e impulse buying, reminded impulse buying,\nsuggestion impulse buying, and planned impulse buying:[93]\nPure impulse buying\nOccurs outside of the normal purchase behaviour where a\nconsumer experiences a strong emotion of desire towards a\nproduct that he/she did not initially plan to buy.[29] This is type of\nimpulse buying is commonly influenced by low prices and even the\napproval to touch the product as this will create the imagine of\nactually owning the product.\nReminded impulse buying\nOccurs when a consumer remembers the need for a product by\nseeing it in a store.[94] This is triggered through various techniques\nsuch as in-store advertising or sensory marketing.[29] For example,\na consumer may be reminded to buy ingredients for a barbecue\nwhen he/she drives past a butcher store.\nSuggestion impulse buying\nOccurs when a consumer sees a product that they have no prior knowledge abou t, envisions a use for it, and\ndecides that they need it.[95] An example of suggestion impulse buying is when a consumer is encoura ged to\npurchase an electric hand-mixer after having picked up a brochure from  the baking department of a home-\nware store. The brochure convinces the consumer of the hand-mixer's s uperiority over the wooden spoon\nshe has been using. Marketing techniques that can also trigger sug gestion impulse buying include long-term\nwarranties or a free trial period.[29]\nPlanned impulse buying\nInvolves a partially planned intention of buying, however specific produc t or categories are not yet\ndetermined.[92] In this case, the consumer\u2019s purchasing decision can be encouraged by r etailing staff, or even\ntheir peers who can persuade the consumer to purchase a substitute or prov ide reassurance about an\nalternative brand choice.\nRecent research carried out by Nielsen International suggests t hat about 72 percent of FMCG purchases are\nplanned, but that 28 percent of supermarket purchases are unplanned or impuls e purchases. The top unplanned\npurchases in the food category are candy (lollies), chocolate, cookies (bisc uits), frozen desserts and snacks and the\ntop unplanned purchases in the non-food category are cosmetics, air-fres heners, toothbrushes, hand-soaps and\nhand/body lotions.[96] This explains why supermarkets place these types of products at the fron t of the store or near\nthe checkout where the consumer spends more time and is more likely to noti ce them and therefore more likely to\npop them into the shopping basket.

Westbrook (1987, p. 259) defines affect as a \u201cclass of menta l phenomena uniquely\ncharacterised by a consciously experienced, subjective feeling sta te, commonly accompanying emotions and\nmoods[97]\" suggesting that these concepts are closely related. Research su ggests that affect plays an important role\nin underlying attitudes, as well as shaping evaluation and decision- making.[98]\nConsumer researchers have noted the difficulties separating the  concepts of affect, emotions, feelings and mood.\nThe line between emotions and mood is difficult to draw and consumer resear chers often use the concepts\ninterchangeably.[99] Yet other researchers note that a detailed understanding of the rela tionship between affect and\nconsumer behaviour has been hampered by the lack of research in the area .[100] Indeed, within the consumer\nbehaviour literature, there is widespread agreement that the role of  emotions is an area that is currently under-\nresearched and is in need of greater attention, both theoretically and e mpirically.\nInformation search\nStudies have found that people in a positive mood are more efficient at infor mation search activities. That, is they\nare more efficient at processing information, are able to integrate i nformation by identifying useful relationships and\narrive at creative solutions to problems. Due to their efficiency proce ssing information, those who are in a positive\nmood are generally quicker to make decisions and easier to please. Research  consistently shows that people in a\npositive mood are more likely to evaluate information positively.[101] As online environments become more\nimportant as a consumer search tool, it may be prudent for web designers to con sider site-design issues such as\nease of navigation, lest poor design contribute to customer frustration t hereby engendering a bad mood and\nultimately leading to unfavourable product/brand evaluations.\nChoice\nAffect may play an important role in impulse-buying decisions. Resear ch\nsuggests that consumers place higher weightings on immediate af fective\nrewards and punishments, while delayed rewards receive less\nweighting.[102] For instance, the immediate hedonic pleasure of eating a\nsweet treat often outweighs the longer term benefits of eating a he althy\nalternative such as fruit. This occurs because the immediate emot ional\ngain is a strong driver, and one that consumers can readily visualise\nwhereas the more distant goal lacks sufficient strength to drive ch oice.\nCustomer satisfaction\nThe relationship between affect and customer satisfaction is an ar ea that\nhas received considerable academic attention, especially in the ser vices\nmarketing literature.[103] The proposition that there is a positive\nrelationship between affect and satisfaction is well supported in the\nliterature.

In advertising, it is  common to identify advertising with two\ndifferent approaches to persuasion: (a) thinking ads - those that require cognitive processing (also known as the\ncentral route to persuasion ) and, (b) feeling ads  - those that are processed at an emotional level (also known as\nthe peripheral route ).[105] Advertisers can bypass cognitive, rational processing which can lea d to counter-arguing\nby simply appealing to the emotions. Neuro-imaging studies suggest tha t when evaluating brands, consumers\nprimarily use emotions (personal feelings and experiences) rather  than information (brand attributes, features, and\nfacts).[106]\nIt is relatively widely accepted that emotional responses require fe wer processing resources (i.e. are easier) and\nalso result in more enduring associations with the brand being adverti sed.[107] Feelings elicited by the advertising\nmessage can shape attitudes towards the brand and to the advertisement .[108]\nCustomer loyalty\nCustomer loyalty, defined as \u201cthe relationship between an individual' s relative attitude and repeat patronage\" (Dick\nand Basu, 1994: p. 99).

May occur when competing brands are seen as similar\nor in the case of new brands (or categories) where insufficient time\nhas elapsed for loyalty to become established.\nSpurious Loyalty\nCharacterised by low relative attitude and high repeat patronage.\nSpurious loyalty occurs when the consumer undertakes repeat\npurchasing due to situational factors such as access, convenience\nor shelf placement. Spurious loyalty can also occur when there are\nno genuine alternatives or the consumer is \u2018locked-in\u2019 to\npurchasing a given brand due to some quasi-contractual\narrangement or membership status which creates difficulties for\nswitching. In other words, where switching costs are relatively\nhigh, high patronage behaviour may be observed despite the\nabsence of a favourable attitude towards the brand.

For marketers,\ntrue loyalty is the ideal situation.\nLoyalty marketing programs are built on the insight that it costs 5-20\ntimes more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing\ncustomer.[110] Marketers use a variety of loyalty programs to strengthen\ncustomer attitudes towards the brand (or service provider/ retailer) i n\norder to retain customers, minimise customer defections and strength en\nloyalty bonds with existing customers. Broadly there are two types of\nprogram: reward and recognition programs. In a Reward Program , the\ncustomer accumulates points for each purchase, and the points can\nsubsequently be exchanged for goods or services.[111] Recognition\nPrograms  operate on a quasi-membership basis where the consumer is\nissued with a card that upon presentation leads to various entitlement s\nsuch as free upgrades, special privileges or access to products/servic es\nthat are not normally available to non- members, and that acknowledge\nthe loyal customer's \"VIP\" status.[112] For example, a hotel might\nrecognise loyal patrons by providing a complimentary fruit bowl and\nbottle of champagne in the room on arrival. Whereas reward programs\nare motivated by the consumer's desire for material possessions,\nrecognition programs are motivated by the consumer's need for esteem,\nrecognition and status. Many commercial loyalty programs are hybrid\nschemes, combining elements of both reward and recognition. In\naddition, not all reward programs are designed to encourage loyalty.\nCertain reward programs are designed to encourage other types of\npositive customer behaviour such as the provision of referrals or\nproviding positive word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations.[113]\nLoyalty marketing can involve the use of databases and sophisticated\nsoftware to analyse and profile customer loyalty segments with a vie w to\nidentifying the most desirable segments, setting goals for each seg ment\nand ultimately attempting to increase the size of the loyal custome r base.\nCustomer citizenship behaviour\nCustomer citizenship behaviour refers to actions that are not part of t he customer's normal behaviour, that are of a\nvoluntary or discretionary in nature and which are thoughtful, consi derate and helpful. Citizenship behaviour often\nrequires some type of sacrifice on the part of customers.[114] Service marketers are particularly interested in\ncitizenship behaviour because it harnesses the consumer's labour pow er, and therefore increases organisational\nefficiency.

Different types of ethnographic research  are\nused in marketing including;[117]\nObserved product usage: observing regular product usage at home\nor work, to gain insights into how products are opened, prepared,\nconsumed, stored, disposed etc. to gain insights into the usefulness\nof packaging, labelling and general usage\nDay-in-the-life studies: extended visits during product usage sit uations to gain insights into norms and\nconsumer expectations\nAccompanied purchase or shop-alongs: researcher accompanies a shopper on a  purchase expedition to gain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ae224d5-0d69-48ca-a78e-5336e2aacafb": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ae224d5-0d69-48ca-a78e-5336e2aacafb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1787a01a-9f9b-4e3c-86e0-c80e8c242ab6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "bd3bbe5f0b69254ee0dea45638a0414f434e2abd16e0c8ba38ba49bc9e938d47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29251af6-c50b-4cfd-93dd-e2c6f610f460", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "data/Chap27.pdf"}, "hash": "09d6e104c67c11bfd1b521bb8b839aa0a5fa979500457254d83da3e7dff3d538", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e79093b-00e5-42cc-9915-60bfb0e86c3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fa672ae64447a18b0cfc6d643d5bf86eb903d91aea98d8f4fb1dc85686f07be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Neuromarketing uses sophisticated\nbiometric sensors such as EEG to\nstudy consumer responses to specific\nstimuliinsights into consumer responses to merchandising and other sales ta ctics\nCultural studies: similar to traditional ethnography; extended sta ys with a group or tribe with a view to\nuncovering the fundamental rules and conventions that govern behav iour\nGuerilla ethnography: random observations in public settings to help es tablish research questions or to gain\nquick insights into specific behaviours\nMystery shopping: observations in the retail context with a view to ga ining insights into the customer's service\nexperience\nMultiple methodologies: combining ethnographic research methods with  conventional research techniques\nwith a view to triangulating results\nTrendspotters such as Faith Popcorn's BrainReserve make extensive  use of ethnographic research to spot emergent\ntrends.[118]\nConsumer neuroscience\nConsumer neuroscience (also known as neuromarketing) refers to the\ncommercial use of neuroscience when applied to the investigation of\nmarketing problems and consumer research. Some researchers have\nargued that the term consumer neuroscience  is preferred over\nneuromarketing or other alternatives.[119]\nConsumer neuroscience employs sophisticated bio-metric sensors, such\nas electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance i maging\n(fMRI) and eye-tracking,[120] to study the ways that consumers respond\nto specific stimuli such as product displays, brands, packaging\ninformation or other marketing signals. Such tests reveal stimuli  that\ntrigger the brain\u2019s pleasure centre.\nConsumer neuroscience has become a mainstream component of\nconsumer research methods. International market research company,\nNielsen Research, has recently added neuromarketing to its service s by acquiring Innerscope, a company\nspecialising in neuromarketing research thus enabling Nielsen  to add neuromarketing research to the suite of\nservices available to clients.[121]\nConsumer neuroscience research has led to some surprising findings :\nFraming value\nFor example, one study reported on a magazine subscription where potential s ubscribers were offered two\noptions: an online subscription for $59, or a combined online and print for $129 a year. Most  people chose\nthe online only option. However, when a third option was introduced: print only f or $129 (i.e. the decoy ),\nthe online and print option seemed like better value and a significant nu mber of people switched to that\noption. In other words, the decoy  price assists in framing value.[122] Marketers use a variety of methods to\nframe value : e.g. quote monthly payment options rather than total price as the former s eems more\nreasonable.\nChoice Fatigue\nResearch by Sheena Iyengar experimented with the number of gourmet  jams on display.

However, when consumers faced with  fewer brands (6 jams), were\nmore likely to make a purchase with 30% going on to buy something. Similar res ults have been observed in\nother categories. The findings suggest that while consumers apprec iate being given some choice, the process\nof making a selection is painful and can lead to choice fatigue.[123] An issue for marketers and retailers is to\ndetermine the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 where consumers are given sufficient  choice to satisfy their desire for variety, but\nnot become overwhelmed by it.\nDecision Paralysis\nOne study examined the wording used to solicit philanthropic donations. Cons umers were exposed to\nvariants in the advertising copy execution: \"Would you be willing to he lp by giving a donation?\" and \"Would\nyou be willing to help by giving a donation? Every penny will help.\" Those gi ven the second option were\nalmost twice as likely to donate. The researchers concluded that people ar e more likely to take action when\ngiven parameters. By clarifying that \u201ceven a penny\u201d could make a diff erence, the second line provides\nguidance and makes the request more achievable.[124] For marketers, the implication is that when asking\nconsumers to take an action, specifying a small step helps to break through  the action paralysis. This finding\nalso suggests that even small differences in advertising copy can  lead to improved outcomes.\nSee also\nReferences\n1.
