"Consuming Experience\nThis book is directly linked to the contemporary trend on experiential consumption and \nmarketing. It highlights the idea that an experience is not something that can be readily managed by \ufb01rms and is not limited to the market: an individual\u2019s daily life is made up of consuming experiences that can occur with or without a market relation.\nThis exciting new text offers an overview of the consumption experience. It outlines \na continuum of experiences of consuming that consumers go through:\nn Experiences that are mainly constructed by consumers around small items \nthat constitute their daily life, such as organic products and non-pro\ufb01t or local \nassociations.\nn Experiences that have been co-developed by companies and consumers. Tourism or \nadventure projects, rock concerts, and cultural events are part of this approach.\nn Experiences that have been largely developed by the companies where consumers \nare immersed in a hyper-real context such as fashion, sports brands, edutainment, and retail.\nBroad and comprehensive, this book provides a challenging vision of the consumption \nexperience.\nAntonella Car\u00f9 is Professor of Marketing at Bocconi University, Milan, Italy.Bernard Cova is Professor of Marketing at Euromed Marseilles, School of Manage-\nment, France and Visiting Professor at Bocconi University, Milan, Italy.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1352, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6759706-859e-4942-a1fe-9e7fd78b17a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6759706-859e-4942-a1fe-9e7fd78b17a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "iii", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ddaf2db-04e0-4bc1-a165-ec27f0e641a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "iii", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b29ee559f330a7682d618115dcb353236969b8ee6c73c3174ce7dac674c315f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbaa7c4b-44ee-41df-bed5-9facfe536d6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "i", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "e3f2ab1dbee17bb920a5550193c4ca327d156e82a799a65ae946e6b94dc3d3e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "86697c3d-5e9f-46c7-aa21-3d7ca8f241e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e102ff2ff7f9f0129a323fffea88bda4de89a9ad7e513396fbb029db80e15c25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Consuming \nExperience\nEdited by\nAntonella Car\u00f9 and  \nBernard Cova", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 65, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86697c3d-5e9f-46c7-aa21-3d7ca8f241e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "86697c3d-5e9f-46c7-aa21-3d7ca8f241e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "iv", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4ab213b-16ee-42d5-910f-147bb675f42d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "iv", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "9af5ccd2e1a4595956d33203fb34336bc14286ee861b5f6076a2a28ec19c2060", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6759706-859e-4942-a1fe-9e7fd78b17a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "iii", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b29ee559f330a7682d618115dcb353236969b8ee6c73c3174ce7dac674c315f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc9ad3f1-1004-4d32-ac2b-5eaf0e87e10e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a7746fabccc0c2f4272f9a4b68e8d5f2b0172563f311d3c9c9300439fa3ccbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "First published 2007  \nby Routledge2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN\nSimultaneously published in the USA and Canada\nby Routledge270 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10016\nRoutledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group\u00a9 2007 Antonella Car\u00f9 and Bernard Cova for editorial selection and \nmaterial; individual contributors, their own contribution\nT ypeset in Perpetua and Bell Gothic by  \nPrepress Projects Ltd, Perth, UKPrinted and bound in Great Britain by  Antony Rowe Ltd, Chippenham, Wiltshire\nAll rights reserved.

These approaches have provided a timely response to the major changes affecting consumption in our western societies and forced companies in turn to revisit their marketing efforts. In reaction to this evolution, some observers have started to espouse the idea of a new marketing panacea that they call experiential marketing, or the marketing of experiences. Unfortunately, and as has far too often been the case in the \ufb01eld of marketing, this new panacea tends to reduce the notion of experience to something that is simple and can be readily managed by \ufb01rms. This is because it focuses more on the modalities by which companies create experiences, and less on trying to understand the complex nature of consumers\u2019 actual consumption experiences and/or how they interact with the corporate product offers generating such experiences.\nFaced with this state of affairs and bolstered by a whole group of Euro-Mediterranean \nresearchers who all share the same critical analysis (one based on a postmodern approach to consumption and marketing), we have designed a book project offering an overview of the consumption experience. This vision is broader and more comprehensive than the one conveyed by experiential marketing, without neglecting the marketing dimensions involved. In other words, this is neither a book about consumers\u2019 experiential behavior nor a manual on experiential marketing, but a work that tries to embrace all of the modulations that can exist between a consumer and a company during the production of a consumption experi-ence. In short, this book is written in such a way as to be accessible and didactic without falling prey to a \u201chow to do\u201d approach.\nSince the very beginning of this project, we have tried to promote research involving \nFrench and Italian institutions. Studies in these \ufb01elds have rarely been translated into Eng-lish, despite their important contribution to knowledge about the consumption experiences. T o mention only a few of the most proli\ufb01c institutions in consumption experience research: in France, IAE in Dijon (tied to the University of Burgundy), ESCP-EAP (Paris), and Eu-romed (Marseilles); and in Italy, Bocconi University (Milan) and the University of Pisa\u2019s Economics Department.

Fifteen years on, this approach appears unfortunately to have gone as far as it can, largely due to marketing\u2019s excessive rationalizing of the relationship between \ufb01rms and consumers. As a result, the discipline is now placing its hopes on the concept of \u201cExperi-ence,\u201d a notion that \ufb01rst arose in consumption and marketing studies in a seminal article written by Holbrook and Hirschman (1982): \u201cThe Experiential Aspects of Consumption: Consumer Fantasy, Feelings and Fun.\u201d T wenty years later, experience has evolved to become a key element in the understanding of hedonistic consumer behavior. It has also become the main foundation for an experience economy (Pine and Gilmore, 1999), recently followed by the advent of experiential marketing (Schmitt, 1999, 2003), an area that tends to highlight immersion in consuming experiences as opposed to the mere purchasing of simple products or services.

Consump-tion has become an activity that involves a production of meaning, as well as a \ufb01eld of sym-bolic exchanges. Consumers do not consume products or services. Quite the contrary, they consume the products\u2019 meanings and images, and take it for granted that an object will ful\ufb01ll certain functions. It is the object\u2019s image that makes the difference. Although it may seem surprising to talk about meanings and symbols in those areas that have tended to be domi-nated by marketing and commercial objectives, it is despite and beyond such objectivism that a product can turn into a vector of esthetics. Latently and manifestly, the 1980s were an era when the estheticization of everyday life (and its corollary, hedonism) in\ufb01ltrated the \ufb01eld of consumption. Consumers became progressively perceived as emotional beings seek-ing sensorial experiences that they could derive from their interactions with the products and services found in the market system. What this entails is an embodiment of meanings in the form of experiences. Individuals are put on stage in a way that emphasizes sensuality and the signi\ufb01cance of the experiences they live through. Consuming experiences have been theorized as personal and subjective experiences that people go through, ones that are often laden with emotionality for the consumer (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982).\nSince then, consumer behavior researchers (Addis and Holbrook, 2001) have tried to \nrebalance the functional and utilitarian vision of consumption by applying a so-called expe-riential perspective that focuses on hedonistic values and individual subjectivity (Figure 1.1).

Inversely, in an experiential perspective, consumers are less interested in maximizing their bene\ufb01ts and more focused on hedonistic grati\ufb01cation within a given social context. Consumption here provokes sensations and emotions that do much more than merely respond to an individual\u2019s own needs, as they also touch upon the consumer\u2019s search for an identity. In the view of many sociologists, the vehicle for an individual\u2019s construction of his/her identity is no longer work (in other words, productive\n activity), but consumption. On the other hand, philosophers, poets, and \nmoralists who study the culture have questioned whether people work to live or whether they live to work. The dilemma that has come to preoccupy our contemporaries can usually be formulated thus: should we consume to live or should we live to consume? T oday, people consume mainly to exist (identity) and not only to live (needs). It is through consumption that people build up and reinforce their identities, which are increasingly eroded by factors such as unemployment, divorce, the break-up of a family, mobility, etc. We no longer simply \u201crun a few errands\u201d \u2013 we now \u201clive experiences,\u201d usually ones that are embodied as they call upon all of our senses.\nTHE CONSUMING EXPERIENCE\nThe origin of the concept of experience can be found in the romantic currents of the eigh-teenth century, that is in a way of life that emphasized change, diversity, and imagination (Holbrook, 1997). The goal here was the development of an interesting life in which an individual could feel ful\ufb01lled and complete. Romanticism associated the search for intensive pleasure with states of extreme emotional excitement, contrasting them with the lukewarm mediocrity of daily life. Combined with western society\u2019s quest for an identity, this led to a search for experiences. The more individuals focused on their own life, the more they demanded that the trivialities of their daily existence be imbued with meaning. Living ex-periences became the only thing of any interest. This turned the consumer into a romantic hero, the romance here being his/her daily life.\nThe salient attributes of experiential consumption are as follows:\nn consumers are not only consumers;\nn consumers act within situations;\nn consumers seek meaning;\nn consumption involves more than mere purchasing.\nIn the experiential perspective, the consumption experience is no longer limited to pre-\npurchase activities (stimulation of a need, search for information, assessment, etc.) or to postpurchase activities (assessment of satisfaction), but includes a series of other activities that in\ufb02uence consumers\u2019 decisions and future actions. As such, consuming experiences are spread over a period of time that can be divided into four major stages (Arnould et al., \n2002):", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2997, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ee0b3c5-fd81-4737-bd14-a06ecd180eed": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ee0b3c5-fd81-4737-bd14-a06ecd180eed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d83ea612-30e7-4846-a7e5-7db51eed2a0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "3cd6578dc01c65c93fd456a0c539a90273b55a9a89ebe95673a80e11d86964c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5180e304-53a6-4605-bc6f-6c697030bc17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "25231e16dcb0bda664ad88a261a48dddb4ec97b02bab247d12f50c3af0327a11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71453af9-cd39-4dcd-9f3e-5ef9eae3dace", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e93a8ad45e2a73239f5a471f9b8e09008f4fb1dec30c9f466df922f0b24399f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CAR\u00d9 AND COVA\nn 6n the preconsumption experience, which involves searching for, planning, day-dreaming \nabout, and foreseeing or imagining the experience;\nn the purchasing experience, which involves choosing the item, payment, packaging, and \nthe encounter with the service and the environment;\nn the core consumption experience, which involves sensation, satiety, satisfaction/\ndissatisfaction, irritation/\ufb02ow, and transformation;\nn the remembered consumption experience and the nostalgia experience, in which \nphotographs are used to relive a past experience based on narratives and arguments with \nfriends about the past, something that tends toward the classi\ufb01cation of memories.\nAs a result, the consuming experience is more than a mere shopping experience, e.g., \nan individual\u2019s experience at a point-of-sale (also called a service encounter in services research). This concept of a shopping experience has, since the 1970s, been based on a series of studies that have looked at purchasing behavior at the point-of-sale and tried to supersede the hypothesis of consumer rationality. What was \ufb01rst revealed was a so-called recreative type of consumer. Broader studies that were conducted subsequently highlighted hedonistic behavior in most consumers, diverting attention away from the utilitarian to the hedonistic value of shopping. In these studies, the consumer is seen as an individual who is emotionally involved in a shopping process in which multisensory, imaginary, and emotive aspects are speci\ufb01cally sought after and appreciated. Retailing research converged here with sociological studies that focused on the same issues (Falk and Campbell, 1997), the assump-tion being that the enjoyment derived from shopping does not stem from buying, wanting, or desiring products, but that shopping is a socioeconomic means of socializing and enjoy-ing oneself and the company of others while making purchases. Hedonistic and utilitarian motivations thus become so closely intertwined that it would seem wrong to countermand them. Examples of shopping experiences range from cultural consumption in a museum to spectacular consumption at Nike T own, Chicago.\nAlthough shopping was initially deemed to constitute the main \ufb01eld of experiential con-\nsumption, today, it would appear that the explosion of subjectivity has generalized through-out western society, thereby extending the experiential domain to all sectors of consump-tion. Some would even characterize modern consumption as something akin to the pleasure of being immersed in McDisney\ufb01ed banalities. Having said that, there is little agreement as to the source and level of pleasure that consumers derive from such experiences. For some observers (particularly for specialists in what has been called \u201cretail re-enchantment\u201d), plea-sure stems from a McDonald\u2019s-type experiential shaping of daily banalities. They say that the re-enchantment of our daily lives entails a whole succession of micropleasures, recurring affordable microtreats that derive from in-store consuming experiences. Through a number of polysensorial stimulations, consumption here is transformed into an entertainment op-portunity and into a hedonic experience. For other analysts, notably the proponents of postmodern marketing (Firat and Dholakia, 1998), what pleasure offers is a total immer-sion in an original experience.

The idea is that a consumer comes to market to \nproduce his/her identity, so that s/he is in fact seeking the experience of being immersed in a thematized framework rather than a mere encounter with some \ufb01nished product. These immersions in enclavized and secure contexts contrast with the stress of people\u2019s daily lives, and sometimes go as far as to help them to live other persons\u2019 experiences. This immersion in a consuming experience is tantamount to diving into a framework that has been totally thematized, enclavized, and made secure. One notable example of this is Rainforest Caf\u00e9.\nWhether at the level of a simple experiential shaping or at the deeper level of a total \nimmersion in a thematized framework, experiential consumption (construed as a staging in which individuals \ufb01nd themselves surrounded by a vast symbolic system) appears to be indistinguishable from the advent of simulations and virtuality. One of the main dimensions of today\u2019s consumption is what the sociologist Baudrillard (1988) once termed hyper-real-ity. We increasingly satisfy ourselves with a reality composed of images, accepting copies as a substitute for anything else. Our secret is that we no longer want originality with its harsh reality, preferring sweetened arti\ufb01ces instead. We \ufb01nd copies to be truer than the reality they are supposed to represent. Even more poignantly, today reality seems to have disappeared \u2013 all we have left are images, illusions, and simulations, i.e., copies of real things, manifesta-tions without any origins or intrinsic reality. Images have become incapable of imagining reality, because that is what they themselves have become (Baudrillard, 1988). Most post-modern examples of hyper-reality involve the consumption of leisure-oriented simulations. Without even mentioning Disney World (which is no more or less than one gigantic simula-tion), Aquaboulevard and other facilities such as Center Parcs offer interesting examples of simulated beaches and parks that some consumers prefer to real beaches and parks. All in all, today we can clearly observe consumers\u2019 tendency to prefer simulated experiences to reality. Moreover, these simulated experiences have become increasingly spectacular and extravagant (Ritzer, 1999).\nTHE PRODUCTION OF EXPERIENCES\nAlthough it is widely accepted within an experiential perspective that consumers are not passive agents reacting to stimuli but, instead, the actors and the producers of their own consuming experiences (however hyper-real these may be), \ufb01rms have nevertheless worked hard to facilitate the production of such experiences. The methods advanced to enable \ufb01rms to (co)-produce experiences on consumers\u2019 behalf have one point in common \u2013 they try to create a theater and a stage for both the consumer and what the company is offering. This is achieved through in-depth work on the decor, i.e., on the environmental design and on the atmosphere at the point-of-sale. When a \ufb01rm or a brand delivers only products and not services, it is advisable that it create its own premises (theaters of consumption) so that the consumer can experience its products without the intrusion of any competing in\ufb02uences. This is what happens in Nike T owns or in other concept or \ufb02agship stores. Further examples include Nutella (hazelnut spread) restaurants or Nespresso caf\u00e9s.

Other analysts emphasize the product\u2019s narrative, i.e., the intrigue or the story that the cor-porate offer and the consumer will be enacting.\nAll in all, the production of experiences can be deemed to include three main facets:\nn decor, design, staging, with special attention being paid to multisensorial stimulation;\nn active participation by the consumer, helped by all sorts of facilitators who specify each \nparty\u2019s role in all of the rituals being set up in the orbit of what the company is offering (see case vignette 1.1);\nn the narrative, story, and intrigues that are created, the most important of which is the \ncreation of memories, usually in the form of derivative products (see case vignette 1.1).\nCASE VIGNETTE 1.1: \u201cEVERY GUINNESS IS A \nUNIQUE EXPERIENCE\u201d\n\u201cEvery Guinness is a unique experience\u201d is the title of this famous Irish beer \nmaker\u2019s latest advertising campaign in France (spring 2003). To help consumers have this experience, Guinness proactively explained to consumers which rituals and role should be part of their interaction with its product if they wanted to feel the same pleasure with a new can of Draught Guinness as they do when they go to a pub.\nIn Ireland and across the world, people go to pubs to celebrate Draught Guin-ness as a ritual. They admire the bartender\u2019s talent when pouring the beer into pint glasses and watch its creamy head rise slowly. They know how to be patient.

In experiential marketing, experience has become a new type of company offer alongside com-modities, products, and services (Pine and Gilmore, 1999). It is a fourth category, and one that is particularly well adapted to the needs of the postmodern consumer.\nIn this vision, a good experience must be unforgettable, if not extraordinary. Reintegrat-\ning the idea of immersion (Firat and Dholakia, 1998), experiential marketing then suggested that consumption be turned into a series of extraordinary immersions for the consumer who could then engage in the unforgettable processes that constitute the experience or, even better, be transformed because of these experiences. Experiential marketing experts believe that the shift from a commodity to a transformation increases the economic value of a company\u2019s offer (Pine and Gilmore, 1999). By so doing, this school of thought appropriates experience studies by the famous psychologist Csikszentmihalyi (1997), in which the best experience is considered to be a \ufb02ow one, i.e., an exceptional moment during which what we feel, desire, and think are in total harmony. Only a small fraction of consumer experi-ences can be classi\ufb01ed as \ufb02ow activities. However, \ufb02ow activities are pivotal for marketing because they represent peak experiences (Arnould et al., 2002). As such, it is indeed this \nspeci\ufb01c \ufb02ow vision of the consumption experience that has become the foundation of the entire experiential approach in marketing (see case vignette 1.2).

Take a can of Guinness and \ufb01nd a 33-cl glass. Open the can and listen \nwhile the gas escapes.

Pour the entire contents of the can out in one fell swoop.Step 3: Take your time to observe the creamy head that will rise to the top of your glass. Your Guinness is ready to be tasted.\nThis advertising does not replace the ritualized experience of the pub with the \nimmediacy of a functional consumption at home. Quite the contrary, it stresses the exact steps in the process that the consumer must fastidiously adhere to so as to create an experience at home that is similar to the one s/he has at the pub (\u201cleave,\u201d \u201clisten,\u201d \u201cwait,\u201d \u201ctake your time\u201d).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2936, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "577a54cf-c68d-44be-ba71-12cd5e6a6c96": {"__data__": {"id_": "577a54cf-c68d-44be-ba71-12cd5e6a6c96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99a94744-e36c-4230-846a-ef021c951c67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "7028f1115aba32fc2f503d6a17dfc19572488e14abb6ac90939cec757cfb8d61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b2bd10a-d249-4839-b8f7-23a1aa2ab582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "8b39ce1aa10cbb6261ac581aa31bbf51eb4d640a4e4459024cc7a211c1addc14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7042dc23-1fbc-47b2-8cda-64fb5337ee69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f56e7c409ca12a4202f2cfc8e155ba4a94b62cfe4b4ea580a34d9c769941a1cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CAR\u00d9 AND COVA\nn 10experience, marketing has recycled and implemented Baudrillard\u2019s notion of hyper-real-\nity: an experience becomes extraordinary thanks to increasingly spectacular and surprising decors and due to the ever greater scope of the extravagances and simulations in which the consumer will be immersed.\nThe achievement of these extraordinary experiences has been the main area of discus-\nsion for various experts (Pine and Gilmore, 1999; Schmitt, 1999, 2003; LaSalle and Britton, 2003) who developed different experiential marketing approaches. The main point is that experiences must be memorable and must involve the individual\u2019s personal sphere: experts answered the question on how to create this kind of experiences in different ways, always trying to codify a sequence of steps or activities useful to reach that goal. According to Pine and Gilmore (1999), the staging is the core of extraordinary experiences\u2019 creation, as the production and the supply are the core of goods and services production respectively. They identify some speci\ufb01c actions for the experience \u201cstaging\u201d: the \ufb01rst one is the preparation of the stage, which varies according to the different areas of the experience (entertainment, education, desire to escape, and esthetic experience) and to the different opportunities offered by each area; the second one is turning experience into a show, by giving it a speci\ufb01c theme; for this purpose, they identify a list of possible functional themes. Again, it is neces-sary to personalize the experience, to search for a sole value for the customer, which is based on the ability to surprise him/her. In this extraordinary experience creation process, the metaphor evoked is the one of theater, which, in its various forms, represents the model. In the title of his \ufb01rst book, Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, \nAct and Relate to Your Company and Brands , Schmitt (1999) makes clear the idea that the goal \nof experiences\u2019 creation is to introduce speci\ufb01c customer behaviors and reactions. Thus, CASE VIGNETTE 1.2: ARGUMENTS USED BY \nEXPERTS IN EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING\nIncreasingly, marketers understand that consumers are living human beings with \nexperiential needs: consumers want to be stimulated, entertained, educated, and challenged. They are looking for brands that provide meaningful experiences and thus become part of their lives . . . Experiences are personal events that occur in \nresponse to some stimulations (e.g., as provided by marketing efforts before and \nafter purchase). An experience involves the entire living being and can be infused into a product, used to enhance a service, or created as an entity into itself. Ex-periences provide consumers a way to engage physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, and spiritually in the consumption of the product or service making the interaction meaningfully real.\nMomentum Experiential Marketing (McCann-Erickson) website.\nhttp://www.mccann.com/aboutus/mem.html", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2997, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7042dc23-1fbc-47b2-8cda-64fb5337ee69": {"__data__": {"id_": "7042dc23-1fbc-47b2-8cda-64fb5337ee69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0831607b-52ad-47cb-a676-153555ec3465", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "53ed80edc64cc7808dc1519f471053e6c68e764a45808f91ce1970136a5fbfb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "577a54cf-c68d-44be-ba71-12cd5e6a6c96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "7028f1115aba32fc2f503d6a17dfc19572488e14abb6ac90939cec757cfb8d61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1af03d8-7a2e-4f38-8976-23c4fee09deb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb6855380729ee8ab97dd7f1e389c02416cf48b8f7964a2d22b0d08c222ca603", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CONSUMING EXPERIENCES: AN INTRODUCTION\n11 ncustomer experience management (CEM) (Schmitt, 2003) is the process of strategically \nmanaging a customer\u2019s entire experience with a product or a company, a process that has \ufb01ve basic steps: analyzing the experiential world of the customer; building the experiential platform; designing the brand experience; structuring the customer interface; and engaging in continuous innovation. LaSalle and Britton (2003) shift the attention to the customer\u2019s decisional process in order to spot the actions to be undertaken by the company in each phase. The consumer\u2019s decisional process is made up of \ufb01ve stages \u2013 discover, evaluate, acquire, integrate, and extend \u2013 through which the consumer moves during consumption. By examining these stages, a business can see rewards and sacri\ufb01ces through its customers\u2019 eyes, thus uncovering the real value of an offering.\nRESISTANCE TO EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING\nWhereas research in consumer behavior has tended to adopt a conceptualization that views experience as a subjective episode in an individual\u2019s construction/transformation (stressing emotional and sensorial dimensions to the detriment of a cognitive dimension), experiential marketing has imbued experience with a more objective meaning, focusing on the compa-ny\u2019s planning and implementation of what it is offering, while accentuating the idea that the outcome should be something that is very signi\ufb01cant and unforgettable for the consumer living through this experience. In just a few years, experiential marketing has changed the status of consuming experiences, displacing them from what consumers have personally gone through to participation in a consumption festival dominated by excess, extravagance, magic, spectacularity, and simulation.\nHaving said that, there has been a great deal of criticism of the limited and planned \nnature of these consuming experiences, which are very manipulative and predetermined and therefore meet with resistance from some consumers. Indeed, such experiences leave the consumer very little room to really participate in their conception and construction. Con-sumers become actors only insofar as they are allowed to do this, i.e., when they ful\ufb01ll their role as a consumer overwhelmed by the experience\u2019s context. Y et, consumers seemingly not only want to be immersed in their experiences but also seek to design and actively produce them. For many consumers, an experience is more than the simple acceptance of a prepack-aged offer revolving around a theme that has been chosen by the \ufb01rm (thematization of the experience) \u2013 some of it must also be left unorganized so that it can become appropriable. A good example of the appropriation of experience in the daily life of our hypermodern contemporaries is the consumption of holidays. Seventy percent of all Europeans produce their own holidays. This is a way for them to appropriate their vacations.\nT o an experience that has been organized and planned by the \ufb01rm, the consumer can \noppose a creation of experiences that is very different in nature, one that can be described as the art of living as it is characterized by the art of diverting commercial experiences (de Certeau, 1984). The consumer, acting alone or in a group, diverts the product, service, and especially the preplanned experience away from its original intention (as determined by the existing market system) in an attempt to reappropriate it in accordance with his/her", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3470, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1af03d8-7a2e-4f38-8976-23c4fee09deb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1af03d8-7a2e-4f38-8976-23c4fee09deb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2438e2e9-ce12-442a-8a8b-6891b58d2be0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "7d3520d08ed2b5518b909706446ed679648fa1f463a6a06f7fa8e50b3c3c64d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7042dc23-1fbc-47b2-8cda-64fb5337ee69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "ec1d5c0c5952173fcbbb7b8fc92b277d3a1aedb0c630f8d4dcdab9163c955946", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1854d41-6ebd-4589-a55b-929399ea594f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2525207ea8b1ddf44c3b54a9031281a52cdc565d2dd99fd6ba8e62ba376ec8e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CAR\u00d9 AND COVA\nn 12own rules. By so doing, s/he prepares a new prism for analyzing the event, one that can be \nnon-commercial and even anticommercial in tone. This also means getting involved on a local scale in a system whose imposition the consumer refuses to accept. There are many examples of such diversions today. Relatively organized and dominated by a protest attitude, they seek to create an opposition to the omnipotence of certain world companies, with recent examples including McDonald\u2019s and \u201cPigeon McNuggets\u201d actions or Danone and the famous \u201cI boycott Danone\u201d website.

All of these groups signify our contemporaries\u2019 crucial need to reappropriate their daily experiences. At the same time, many collective experiences have tended to reappropriate products and services found in the market system without this being part of a conscious protest. Examples include fan associations that dig up and pamper yesterday\u2019s products such as the old Mini car or Apple Newton pad. The meanings and usages that these groups are associating with such products differ from what was originally intended. Moreover, this building of mean-ing through experience and shared emotion constitutes a daily episode in the creation, consolidation, and preservation of a communitarian sentiment within such groups. What all of these actions have in common is that they constitute experiences that help the product or service to evolve beyond its simple status as a merchandise, thereby enabling consumers to have an experience that is not totally commercial in nature while continuing to function within a commercial framework, i.e., one that is de\ufb01ned by the interactions that brands and companies have initiated.\nA CONTINUUM OF CONSUMING EXPERIENCES\nMoving on to consider consuming experiences, it is essential to go beyond a view of experi-ence that is totally dependent on what the market system offers. The sociology of consump-tion (Edgell et al., 1997) has highlighted four types of consumption experience as a function \nof the mode of provision, which is not just a market question. These are: family experiences resulting from family ties; friendship experiences resulting from reciprocal relations within a community; citizenship experiences linked to relations with the state; and consumer experi-ences connected to exchanges with the market (T able 1.1).\nThis indicates that an individual\u2019s daily life is made up of consuming experiences that \ncan occur with or without a market relation. Each experience is not, therefore, necessarily a market consumption experience or consumer experience. The consuming experience of a meal at a friend\u2019s house is linked to a sphere outside the market, even if products from the market may be consumed. In the same way, the communal consumption of a self-produced show is outside the notion of a consumer experience. Thus, for the sociologists of consump-tion, social relations shape the experience of consuming (Edgell et al., 1997). Moreover, experiential marketing is interested only in the speci\ufb01c social context of the market, in which the individual is a consumer living experiences with the supplier and with other consumers.\nAll in all, we can outline a continuum of consuming experiences that consumers go \nthrough:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1854d41-6ebd-4589-a55b-929399ea594f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1854d41-6ebd-4589-a55b-929399ea594f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a12e1c29-15d3-4dc3-a310-47651bbd983d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b82a1f9a73692f77d461122661e3d472f082dcee1dad9a87ab828684df605a04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1af03d8-7a2e-4f38-8976-23c4fee09deb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "7d3520d08ed2b5518b909706446ed679648fa1f463a6a06f7fa8e50b3c3c64d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aeecf258-c3f4-4b5f-b5c9-535638d3411c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62c1f0391ee7e1ffa6ad9f67bb78b558e89863acdf6ce418c80db57e5fe65a82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CONSUMING EXPERIENCES: AN INTRODUCTION\n13 nn At one extreme are experiences that are mainly constructed by the consumers and \nwhich can involve company-provided products or services.

No wonder the concept had failed in the sterile environment of a research studio. Red Bull needed to be experienced. Just like Gatorade worked in taste testing only when participants were dehydrated and the Gatorade ice cold, Red Bull will not score highly in a laboratory situation. It is at its core a functional drink, intended to provide a boost of energy. But on top, to survive in a category where image rules, Red Bull needed to establish an attitude (vs. an image), and not just be sold as an over-the-counter nutraceuti-cal, if it wanted to reach signi\ufb01cant scale. The bulk of Red Bull\u2019s marketing has been (what conventional marketers would call) below-the-line.

Consum-\ners have always engaged imaginatively, creatively, and constructively with the world around \nthem. In recent times, many marketing managers have become enamored with the concepts of experience economies (Pine and Gilmore, 1999) and entertainment economies (Wolf, 1999), which tend to be interpreted (super\ufb01cially and, especially in relation to Pine and Gilmore\u2019s work, we would argue wrongly) as promising hordes of hungry, empty consumers waiting to be entertained by the vast thematic offerings of producers: theme parks leading to theme hotels, theme stores, theme restaurants, wall-sized screens in stores, museums, churches, gymnasiums, schools, and so on (see Gottdeiner, 1997). Y et, acts of consumer imagination are complex and multifaceted, embodied and erotic, often driven more by needs for authenticity and self-expansion than by the desire for entertainment.\nIn this short chapter, we seek to turn the page on experientiality as a provided phe-\nnomenon and reveal it as a complex lived phenomenon in consumer life. Experientiality \u2013 or materiality, in the terms of consumer culture theorists \u2013 with the material world, with objects, places, brands, and ideas occurs in major ways outside the marketer\u2019s ability to observe and ability to control. Consumers tend to be tricky wild things who \ufb01nd their own uses for marketed things and brands to be more interesting than those intended by market-ers. Seeking authenticity and truth as well as fun and amusement, consumers bring their own conceptual and creative apparatus to the party.\nT o illustrate and develop these ideas, we will offer a range of examples from our ethno-\ngraphic and netnographic research, carried out both individually and collectively. Through our consumption looking glass, we followed consumer experiences in place, time, theme, and imaginary, immersed ourselves in diverse marketscapes and \ufb02agship brand stores, at-tended media fan conventions, roamed doll stores and sports bars, and participated in tradi-tional village fetes and mass-mediated festivals. Our investigative focus has taken us from the middle of the Nevada desert to the rural prealpine mountains of Italy, from downtown Chi-cago to T oronto\u2019s airport noise-drenched suburbs.\n1 Seeking the elusive \u201cpassive\u201d consumer \nwho seeks the out-of-the-box experiences of modern marketing\u2019s experience economists, we were less than disappointed instead to \ufb01nd different brands of material experiencers, creative co-producers who added and enhanced their experiences. These consumers placed themselves on multiple stages, acted the parts, and became the experience.\nThrough their experiences, we extrapolate principles to assist our understanding of the \ntypes of powerful marketplace offerings that can bridge the distance between spectacularly mediated theme worlds and augmented authentic grassroots experience. In so doing, we try to close many gaps: between mass marketing and local meaning; between commercial constructions and communal feelings; between digital technology and meat puppet bodies. The result is co-created experience driven by marketers and consumers in which person and public presence become a part of the retail corporation\u2019s stage, energy, expression, and meaning, and where marketer authenticity can never be completely included in a brand, but only be signaled by its openness.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3604, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a87c7818-eec2-429a-a1a2-5ab7911cf7ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "a87c7818-eec2-429a-a1a2-5ab7911cf7ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0b1716e-6709-453a-bb06-384ea743b68d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "e2501e39b4aa8af8214d24f081edee8f6b4ccdd567133bf5d3744a5c23b23983", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77b7d566-e522-4aa7-a4fc-3334413b5fad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "9e151f6af5b687197b5a752b6c01c38206d71c4a84513ded863db41d71b7cac1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23419cbf-986c-462b-a0cb-a7264fee57d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "205a29eeb9336a4ed12d37bc9e15b86095acd549f189bfccd16cb33d10bc4596", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AGENTS IN PARADISE\n19 nTHE INTERPRETIVE COORDINATES OF EXPERIENCE \nCO-CREATION\nWe can extend T urner\u2019s classic metaphor that says that marketers study consumers for the \nreasons and in the ways that \ufb01shermen study \ufb01sh, while consumer researchers study con-sumers for the reasons and in the ways that marine biologists study \ufb01sh. Notwithstanding, for the moment, the fact that researchers and marketers are, in this metaphor, actually themselves \ufb01sh as well, the implication is that good consumer research can help marketing by teaching about consumer habits, thoughts, and so forth, and thus helping marketers to better bait their hooks. We would argue that a number of scholars, thus far, have taken a view from the surface of the water. The critical scholars of spectacle (e.g., Debord, 1995) tend to see \ufb02ocks of consumers being prodded and tricked into marketers\u2019 nets through the use of attractive theming-as-bait. Consumers are seen to be bombarded and overwhelmed, dazzled by design, blinded by behavioral science and frenetic engineering into evacuating \ufb01rst their minds, then their wallets.\nOn the other hand, pro-experience managerial gurus such as Wolf (1999) see schools \nof consumers swimming hungrily and fruitlessly through the waters of the market, looking for the right kind of lure. Writers such as Wolf argue that shopping is an outlet not only for bargains but for the satisfaction of genuine needs for lightness, fun, and the sharing of life experiences that make life worth living. In short, the one school of thought sees consumers are overwhelmed, driven by producer interests, and the other sees consumer driving the process of commercial experience creation, with producers responding to their needs and feedbacks.\nRecently, a more nuanced view has emerged, treating the prior polarizations as partial \npropositions. Many scholars (Eric Arnould, Linda Price, Linda Scott, Lisa Penaloza, John Sherry, and Robert Kozinets) have written about the active role that consumers play in the process of experiential production\u2013consumption. Consumers treat the complex common grounds of physical commercial playspaces in many ways as their own dropdown menus, drifting and choosing rapidly through their nearly in\ufb01nite combinations in a myriad of ways (see, for example, Sherry, 1998).

We are \ufb01nding that play-ing with agency is all a part of the play, that the successive taking control and surrendering of the reins of consumer experience is, in itself, an important part of the game of marketing (see Brown, 1995; Deighton and Grayson, 1995). Consumption is a dance of polarities.

The Burning Man festival is a large, proto-\nUtopian gathering centered upon the burning of a large wood and neon \ufb01gure of a man, in which community forms quickly and, through the large area of space of the Black Rock desert, is liberated and freed up for playful, ideological, and spiritual pursuits that take place, in some sense, outside the strictures of ordinary market and social logics (Figure 2.1). After several months of working together, the three of us began discussing overlapping \ufb01re festival traditions. Stefania noted similarities between the Black Rock festival and the Burning Old Man and Woman Joy Fire of her native Italian village of Premosello Chiovenda (see case vignette 2.1 for a general overview).\nn Figure 2.1 Self-expression and creation of Sacred Space/Time at Burning Man.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1813, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1383082b-cc9b-44eb-8738-5f58e7d5488a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1383082b-cc9b-44eb-8738-5f58e7d5488a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20b30397-995c-4714-897c-69b0941634ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "d5c8d66555173022835eb6de902e3d6afcb63360203f7312319a56c8aa119482", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23419cbf-986c-462b-a0cb-a7264fee57d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "991fa45484dcfe872c7832f528379a1272a103b3ef62d92632c91e5f92a80282", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bfcf8ba-ae5b-47b1-bc6a-81c68f3f56ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c75569bd359df0c96de3c01ee9eac888b98463c3a398910744c4acd62561541", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AGENTS IN PARADISE\n21 nOne of the key aspects of Burning Man is what has been termed in another investi-\ngation the event\u2019s \u201cludic autotely,\u201d which is the phenomenon through which the event\u2019s \nparticipants are largely responsible for creating and maintaining the playspace for other participants, outside of central organization, \ufb01nancing, or planning.

As with Burning Man\u2019s grassroots growth, participant enthusiasm, and creativity, the participants of the folklore traditions in the north of Italy and in the rest of Europe feel a strong sense of communal connection and participation through their \ufb01re rituals.

This ritual, called Carcavegia, involves the burning of a male and a female \ufb01gure, which are ceremonially named for the oldest man and woman living in the village. The naming and burning are thought to be good luck for the elderly citizens, but very likely draw from earlier times when they, or stand-ins for them, were sacri\ufb01cially burned, probably in a fertility ritual or other appeasement of supernatural forces.\nIn this village, a few volunteers have been given the responsibility of organizing the event \nfor the rest of the community by the local authorities and associations responsible for or-ganizing cultural activities. Over a period of time of six years, we repeatedly observed this group of young people. There were about a dozen young males, who strictly followed local traditions. We observed them as they organized the event as well as during the rest of the year. In the past, the event was considered by these people to be a time for participating in village social life, which they found enjoyable and rewarding. However, the new organizers have recently begun viewing the event in a special way. Rather than regarding the bon\ufb01re simply as a game or social event to occupy them for one week in the year, as was the case for their fathers and grandfathers before them, this generation seems to be treating the event more seriously. Unlike their predecessors, they spend more time on a number of activities which transcend ceremonial preparations. They invest considerable time in the forest, cut-ting wood, preparing the ef\ufb01gy, and then running through the village streets signaling the date of the approaching event.

We can attribute Celtic ori-gins to this ancient tradition; according to some local historians, this ceremony recalls the pagan feast of the dendrophors who raised a pine dedicated to Cibele and Attis. Following other interpretations, we can link these rituals to the pagan sun theory and the natural cycle of the seasons or to the puri\ufb01cation theory. In many instances, the bon\ufb01re ritual symbolizes burning and keeping witches, and therefore evil, away.\nNowadays, the ceremony has lost its original meaning; nonetheless, it has \nkept a magic and spiritual allure. In the Carcavegia, the bon\ufb01re is merely the epilogue of a festival that begins on 2 January. Teenagers and young men are the ones who are in charge of staging the ceremony as part of a tourist event that combines tradition and entertainment in a folkloristic mood. Up to the evening before Epiphany, the streets are full of young people collecting combustible ma-terial for the pyre to the sound of horns and bells, while others make the stuffed \ufb01gures of the \nvecc and the vegia  with a card around their necks bearing the \nnames and surnames.

Indirectly and \nunknowingly rebelling against the more liberal and secular lifestyle of their parents and fellow villagers, a trend started by the ambitious yuppies of the 1980s, their role in maintain-ing their grandfathers\u2019 and great-grandfathers\u2019 lifestyle involves laying claim to their group identity by way of contrast to the contemporary life of their local community. This seems very much like the generational pendulum swings between secular and religious ideologies and conservative and liberal ideologies noted by a number of historians.\nDuring the rest of the year, these young males study, practice sports, and go to bars and the chosen persons change. At the last Carcavegia, in 2005, the man had been \nborn in 1914. This is certainly not a sign of disrespect toward senior citizens but, rather, the continuation of a tradition based on the idea that burning the oldest two in the village can bring good luck.

But their lives are \nspartan, based on the simple and genuine values of life in the mountains. They relish authen-ticity. T o them, this ancient ritual is a way to strip away the modern world and its multiple levels of falsehoods and wrongs. Although they live the life of well-off adolescents and young people alongside that of peasant life, they are returning to a simpler agrarian lifestyle based upon tradition and nostalgia. They devote themselves to agriculture and animal rearing, having bought, either individually or collectively in the last two years, animals for breeding. They renovate old stables. They are supporting themselves mainly by physical labor and economic sacri\ufb01ces. Their day is divided between doing things connected with their social status as high school and university students, sons, workers and so on, and performing acts connected with creating a lifestyle that more faithfully brings them into touch with a primal, older way of life that they consider to be authentic and genuine. Observing the multitask-ing represented by their behavior, actions, speech, and consumer styles, it is interesting to note how this form of identi\ufb01cation and distinction from previous generations requires the performance of the \ufb01re ritual for its legitimization.\nThis ritual provides the stage on which they act out their chosen lives, enact their ref-\nerence values. It represents the ability, strength, and energy catalyzed in the boys\u2019 daily lives, the part that other people do not see during the year and which, in the \ufb01nal analysis, should not be seen because it is linked to the value of simplicity. It is an enactment of local ethos more than merely a retro-touristic performance for outsiders. Mountain life does not require individuals to make their lives into a spectacle; only nature and transcendent forces are required. Bon\ufb01re time, or Carcavegia as it is called in Premosello, is a time for turning nature\u2019s life cycles into a spectacle, from birth to death, for the appearance of magic, the sense of the wonder of nature that follows its course as it always has, year after year. Nature is incorporated, embodied, and harnessed in the ritual giving local ethos a primal charge, in classic T urnerian fashion.\nGiven the importance of this time and the intrinsic sacredness of the ritual, the spectacle \nhas to be magni\ufb01cent. Just as with Burning Man\u2019s ever growing and ever more mass-medi-ated spectacle, the bon\ufb01re must be very high as it symbolizes the strength and energy of the people who have created and tended it. Competitive and masculine, the bigger the \ufb01re, the stronger and more suitable the male. The \ufb01re should be huge, frightening, and imposing, signaling a more powerful village than the neighboring village, halfway down the mountain, which is holding its own \ufb01re ritual. The bon\ufb01re glows out on the mountain, proclaiming an existential \u201cwe are here\u201d once a year, and simultaneously symbolizing the continuity of life. The young men, far from conformists, have their own sense of right and wrong, driven by the \ufb01re\u2019s innate competitive rules. They resist the safety restrictions imposed by the local authority for the event, viewing them as antithetical to the event\u2019s competitive meanings and striving soul. They are unwilling to compromise; \u201ctheir\u201d \ufb01re must be large and frightening, not small and unimpressive. Much is at stake.\nThe \ufb01re\u2019s success symbolizes the abilities and legitimacy \u2013 the worthiness in the eyes \nof whichever gods one chooses \u2013 of this small village community.

The deep involvement of consumers in the Burning Man festival has been documented extensively elsewhere (e.g., Kozinets, 2002; Kozinets and Sherry, 2004). However, the organization, competition, spirituality, and self-governance of these shared experiences are, we believe, no accident. They are central to our understand-ing of the forces that drive the communal adoption of participation in social environments (Figure 2.5).\nThe spectacle, the emancipatory, purifying, cleansing, and literal power of \ufb01re, is no \ndoubt part of the ritual, but \u201c\ufb01re\u201d is an energetic concept that could be applied to many spectacles in our world, including concerts, celebrity, mass media appearances, religion, sports, war, and even major business spectacles such as trade shows. Each, like the bon\ufb01re, promises its own variety of transcendence as well as entertainment. Each has a fanatical following. Each has its leaders and its more passive audiences. But especially in the \ufb01re rituals we have described above, the active participation by devoted attendants, which we call a form of \u201cludic autotely,\u201d is crucial to belief and to psychic resonance. At Burning Man, where thousands of people build theme camps for one another, where people are constantly admonished to \u201cradically participate\u201d and that there are \u201cno spectators\u201d at the event, ac-tive co-creation is woven into the very fabric of the gathering. The grassroots result of this participation is simple, primal, and profound.

Much as with Burning Man\u2019s many art cars, theme camps, and technological innovations, ordinary people at these shows exhibit their own personalized cars, showing interested visitors the devices and innovations that they have created with their own taste and creativity.\nGradually, the section took on the role of a stage for a person\u2019s own performance, for the \nintermingling of individual identity project, life themes, interests, and branded products. In this situation, the consumer/builder and the visitors who share interests and curiosity contribute to the creation of an event and a phenomenon, going beyond the boundaries originally envisioned by event organizers. This transformation from trade show to star of the show seemed to make all the difference to participants. The level and degree of entertain-ment shifted, and the experimental area assumed the coordinates of liminal space (T urner, 1974). New layers of authenticity and meaning accreted. Over time, the phenomenon be-came so signi\ufb01cant that the organizers created a special fair dedicated exclusively to this section of the main fair, which is held today in another city, Rimini, at a different time of the year. T oday, therefore, car enthusiasts have their own physical space and time for an ad hoc event which ultimately rati\ufb01es their \u201csovereignty.\u201d\nAs one of the participants explained, these consumers/builders sometimes dedicate hun-\ndreds of hours of their free time to work on their cars, using their creativity and practical skills to make them unique. During the event, their \u201cbaby\u201d comes to life in front of an audience that can appreciate and understand its value and also relate to its creators (Figure 2.8).\nWhat is fascinating to note about these examples is the role of consumer participation \nin even the most industrial events. The indomitable creativity of the human spirit shines through these examples, as consumers usurp ESPN Zone\u2019s themed environment and, say, use a ri\ufb02e simulation to turn into snipers preying on innocent bystanders, or to become celebrities in a pickup game of basketball on a mini-court (see Kozinets et al., 2004). In \nBurning Man, major degrees of freedom are fully utilized, producing an out-of-this-world artistic and experimental experience. In fact, the etymology of both the words experiment and experience are the same: the Latin root experiri, a test or a trial. Consumers are test-\ning creatively, trying through their actions to express themselves, their individuality. This also exhibit their own personalized cars and share a common passion with the \nvisitors. In the \u201cMy Special Club\u201d section, clubs can hire special areas where they can show their members\u2019 cars.

Market-ers may think that their job is to provide a prepackaged total experience \u2013 but consumers must add their dreams, ideals, values, history, meanings, and personalities to these raw ingredients. In the end, it is only the consumers\u2019 experience that counts.\nPlay becomes a competitive activity in these environments as well, and this is another \npowerful force (Figure 2.9). Consumers struggle against time and each other, in rituals originally designed \u2013 and perhaps still culturally and biologically wired \u2013 as placemarkers in time and space. They contend with other elements as well, notably an arrangement of the game  \nwhich surrounds the process. This includes the rules and order of the game, the hedonistic aspects of the game, the degrees of freedom, the types of players and referees, the creation of a game-playing community that shares the game and thus realizes it or makes it real.

Space is transformed into place through the incorporation and acknowledgment of cultural meaning, of boundaries, rules, structures, paths, which consumers interpret and use as journey-makers to \ufb01nd their own ways. As marketers design experiences, it is powerful to consider what consumers will use these experiences for. Each pilgrimage may be part of a larger pyramid, each experience part of a larger journey. Experiences become the raw mate-rial of life. Place becomes a space for need ful\ufb01llment, interpreted, sculpted, modeling.\nThe co-creation of consumer experience by a self-aware, creative, and active consumer \nwho is able to interpret and freely rede\ufb01ne rules and proposals from marketers can be based on several foundational elements that we have described in this chapter: rules, challenges, competition, community, tradition, history, enactment, and embodiment. The presence of strong culture enhances all of these elements and, in today\u2019s society, as suggested by the Italian and American \ufb01re rituals, a strong sense of tradition and nostalgia seem to signal authenticity to consumers. With their own creativity, imagination, and openness, marketers and their companies might design experiences responsive to customization by the consumer. Marketers might view even the most elaborate experiences as ingredients that consumers will use in different ways for their own differing recipes for life and happiness. Consumers become the co-authors of their own experiences, assisted and listened to by marketers, who offer an incredible profusion of images, myths, stories, and experiences.\nThe never-ending story of consumers as co-creative wild things will then continue, as", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1981, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5646b3a-edc8-44b2-847b-d82c0903870a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5646b3a-edc8-44b2-847b-d82c0903870a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12b201ec-600c-4f9b-9a9c-7bdee2b8f282", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "38a321d9b33ac726bf920dbec05b4b2bf1733d8820a83c2e29d376fae6332fbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3d36f7d-ca80-4b7c-8298-11385c37817a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "43c0d04d3b6a0b53824a7ad30ed0bab0869253a17ced4f7b5c09fd2703044764", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bae85e2-20c0-47fc-b79d-ffe0bd7b95d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf56c82e82a43527a9dad7447302b6db86913889126aa21488b50f19e5e7113c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SHERRY JR ET AL .\nn 32the children\u2019s stories foretell that they will.

A consumption experience is understood here as the pos-sibility of developing meaning and substance in life. Contemporary consumers supposedly prefer being immersed in consumption experiences to simply purchasing products or ser-vices. Consumption is made up of \u201cimmersion into experiential moments of enchanted, multifaceted and spectacular encounters\u201d (Firat and Dholakia, 1998, p. 101). Experiential marketing approaches (Pine and Gilmore, 1999) and postmodern consumption rhetoric (Firat and Dholakia, 1998) make widespread use of an immersion concept that has been borrowed from more or less distant disciplines such as education, literature, psychology, or religion. The concept\u2019s utilization has accelerated along with the rise of the Internet, due to many online operators\u2019 apparent attempts to immerse consumers in a virtual experience. Without forgetting the arts, where the immersion process has long been considered key to an esthetic experience, this construct is used today by analysts interested in a whole range of activities, including tourism, leisure (concerts, festivals, etc.), and sports. T o really grasp this notion, which is central to the consumption experience, the present chapter will begin by developing a consumer immersion model before going on to specify the main elements of the experiential contexts that \ufb01rms can create and manage. It will then conclude by de-tailing the tactics that \ufb01rms and other institutions can pursue to facilitate immersion in an experiential context.KEY POINTS\nn Immersion is the means by which consumers access an experience.\nn Firms can create and manage experiential contexts, not experiences.\nn These experiential contexts can involve stores, factories, brandfests, or \nwebsites.\nn A good experiential context should be enclavized, secured, and \nthematized.\nn Support systems, collective action, and self-determination can be used to \nfacilitate consumer immersion.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2141, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0a3ac84-6926-45db-b331-aa28c3fbe1fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0a3ac84-6926-45db-b331-aa28c3fbe1fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f1ecdf3-9f50-4e51-91cc-eb26972e6971", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "7d2dcb105be538df87848ad8eeb52a2b21cb002af5461a43e1579e8c7a82ce9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7c1275a-e06c-495f-8aac-f5a1a9593238", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "e9c677aa85d99edd5da9e6d2cd65237c931bb6ff1215aba0ef73c1a0f5964f53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bfbfa99-9abe-4234-91af-9163ba7b3dbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa1e88f5acf120ba4b2870eb5e6b0f2ea3da3bcbe5605cf4f8ba03e8203662d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CONSUMER IMMERSION IN AN EXPERIENTIAL CONTEXT\n35 nIMMERSING THE CONSUMER\nIn the \ufb01eld of marketing, immersion cannot be dissociated from experience, a concept that \nhas attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers over the past two decades: \u201cLife is to be produced and created, in effect, constructed through multiple experiences in which the consumer immerses\u201d (Firat and Dholakia, 1998, p. 96). Immersion is perceived as a means of accessing a consumption experience: \u201cImmersion produces the experience\u201d (Firat and Dholakia, 1998, p. 97). In other words, the consumption experience would ap-pear to be a subjective occurrence that people go through by pursuing a process of being im-mersed in an experiential context. It has been widely acknowledged that today\u2019s consumers seek immersion in a variety of experiences ranging from a hyper-real environment (Goulding et al., 2002) to a brand-related social context (Oliver, 1999). Modern practitioners generally talk about immersion in \u201can activity or environment . . . in the sights, sounds and smells that surround them\u201d (Pine and Gilmore, 1998, p. 102); thus, in an experiential context, understood here as an environment, some activities have a sensorial stimulation likely to bring on the experience. For the proponents of experiential marketing (Pine and Gilmore, 1999), consumers\u2019 total, physical, and mental immersion in the activity and/or environment underpinning the experience will help to concretize the experience for them (as will their active participation). Furthermore, although the experience may result from something, for many authors, it is nothing more than an intermediary result (Firat and Venkatesh, 1995). Consumers\u2019 ultimate goal is not the experience itself but a proliferation of experiences. T oday, consumers shop to produce their identities. This offers the possibility of a multitude of experiences that \u201cgive [them] a chance to experience different lifestyles that provide excursions into production or customising of alternative selves and self-images\u201d (Firat and Dholakia, 1998, p. 97). T o summarize, what we are evolving toward is a conceptualization that views immersion as a process of accessing an experience, an intermediary objective that comes on top of people\u2019s other experiences, to produce a result that is \ufb01nal but never \ufb01nished: the consumer\u2019s ongoing identity project (Arnould and Thompson, 2005).\nIn marketing, the immersion concept suffers from the sentiment of immediacy that is best conveyed by the often associated image of a consumer diving into something, a vision that tends to see immersion as nothing more than a model of instantane-ous emotional induction insofar as it seems to suf\ufb01ce that one \u2018be there\u2019 to cause an immersion.\n(Car\u00f9 and Cova, 2003, p. 48)\nIndeed, the immersion concept literally implies an embodied experience, transmitting \nthe idea of a total elimination of the distance between the consumer and the situation. A question does remain, however, as to whether immersion in a consumption experience is always a fast and quasi-instantaneous phenomenon (diving into an experiential context) or whether it involves a slower and therefore more progressive approach (Ladwein, 2003). Moreover, is immersion in a consumption experience necessarily all-encompassing, or can it be partial?

The \ufb01rst formulation views consumers as relatively passive \nand potentially manipulated by the \ufb01rm, while the second sees consumers as people who are relatively active and who are able to immerse themselves in the experience. Whereas the proponents of experiential marketing (Pine and Gilmore, 1999) mainly opt for the image of immersed consumers, others (Filser, 2002) emphasize the role that consumers play as the (co)-producers of their experience, thereby supporting the notion that consumers immerse themselves. Indeed, \u201cthis recognition of consumers\u2019 (experience) production role is one of the new theoretical orientations being shared by several autonomous analytical frameworks\u201d (Filser, 2002, p. 14). This can be connected to the idea of appropriation (Ladwein, 2003), to counterbalance the \ufb01gure of an \u201cinert\u201d consumer who dives into an experiential context. The diving image implies that immersion is tantamount to consumers jumping into a hyper-reality that has largely been introduced by the \ufb01rm itself, which means that they lose their freedom of choice due to pressure from their own emotions and sensations. The idea of ap-propriation, on the other hand, suggests that immersion should be thought of as a whole set of operations that consumers carry out to produce the experience by manipulating to their own advantage whatever is being done to manipulate them. T oward this end, consumers will use the tools, competencies, and aptitudes that they have developed during the course of the experience (Ladwein, 2003). Indeed, it is by acting thus that they will produce their own identity via their consumption.\nFor the postmodern consumer, consumption is not a mere act of devouring, destroy-ing, or using things. It is also not the end process of the (central) economic cycle, but an act of production of experiences and selves or self-images.\n(Firat and Dholakia, 1998, p. 96)\nThese considerations allow us to offer a consumer immersion model (Figure 3.1) in \nwhich the consumer is immersed in an experiential context either immediately and totally by diving into it, or else progressively and partially via appropriation. In this way, cumulative subjective experiences, facilitated by immersion in commercial or non-commercial con-texts, help consumers to construct their own identities.\nEXPERIENTIAL CONTEXTS\nWhat is paramount for any \ufb01rm that has turned to experiential marketing is to devise ex-periential contexts that are likely to encourage consumers\u2019 immersion, so as to render their I just want to say that compared with what I had imagined I found it harder \nthan expected.

Contrary to what \nthe \u201cexperience economy\u201d school asserts (Pine and Gilmore, 1999), \ufb01rms do not actually offer experiences. An experience is a subjective episode that customers live through when they interact with a \ufb01rm\u2019s product or service offer. A \ufb01rm can therefore offer experiential contexts that consumers each mobilize in order to immerse themselves and thus to (co)-produce their own experiences.

Our lives are full of experiential contexts: specially \ufb01tted coaches on modern fast trains, sidewalk cafes where friends can meet for cocktails, family picnics on the beach, etc. Contexts of this kind have always been around. What is novel is the fact that companies are now taking over the production and management of such contexts \u2013 which explains their proliferation in our daily landscape.\nHaving understood individuals\u2019 current need for repeated immersions in contexts of this \nkind, retailers have been trying since the 1980s to transform their points-of-sale into envi-ronments conducive to the advent of so-called shopping experiences (Filser, 2002). A great deal of work has been done on shopping environments, including the way sales spaces are designed, to try and re-enchant customers (Firat and Ventakesh, 1995). These efforts have taken a very speci\ufb01c turn since the late 1990s, on account of producers\u2019 desire to give con-sumers brand experiences that will immerse them in \u201cbranded\u201d experiential contexts. The creation and management of experiential contexts has become one of brand management\u2019s main activities. The aim here is to facilitate consumers\u2019 immersion in an enchanted environ-ment. Of course, consumers can experience a brand outside of such contexts, for example at home using the brand\u2019s products, but for the company, the key experiential contexts are the ones that will allow it to closely control and guide the processes by which people access the experience, as well as the experience itself.

Questions can be raised as to how ef\ufb01cient it is \nto seek this kind of coherence if it implies conditions that are almost \u201cprison-like.\u201d The customary response by the proponents of thematization (Pine and Gilmore, 1999) lies in the idea of the consumer\u2019s concentration. In this view, consumers cannot access an experi-ence if their attention disperses.\nThe company must then work to enunciate and materialize the theme. This involves \ncreating theater effects and staging the company\u2019s product or service offer, and putting the consumer on stage, through major efforts impacting the d\u00e9cor, such as environmental design \nand locational atmospherics (Pine and Gilmore, 1999). These efforts revolve around senso-rial and imaginary devices that serve to overstimulate consumers\u2019 senses and imagination, thereby accentuating their ability to concentrate, which in turn accelerates their immer-sion:\nn The overstimulation of the \ufb01ve senses is achieved through a polysensorial layering of \nconsumers\u2019 senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch (Schmitt, 1999).\nn The overstimulation of imagination involves a constantly renewed introduction of \nnarratives (Filser, 2002), stories, intrigues, and images as part of a playful approach \nknown in retail circles as shoptainment (Kozinets et al., 2002).\nOnce the context has been enclavized, secured, and thematized, and after the theme \nhas been dressed in theater effects and staged, the consumer is supposed to be able to dive seamlessly into the context, thereby accessing the experience. It is here that the theo-ries of experiential marketing and consumption re-enchantment encounter their limits. Some consumers will be able to access an experience, but not everyone. There is nothing straightforward or systematic about this access, which requires competencies or aptitudes that consumers do not necessarily have at their disposal (Ladwein, 2003). In fact, this is a construct that mainly applies to consumers who are already \u201cexperts\u201d in a theme and/or context and can therefore dive straight into it \u2013 not to \u201cnovice\u201d consumers who feel distant from a theme and/or its staging, a sentiment that impedes their immersion, thus killing off the experience. Spectacular staging such as enclavization can even create threshold effects for consumers in this situation. As a result, the immersion of people who are new to a brand and/or a context much more frequently assumes the sequence of nesting, exploration, and stamping, rather than a dive into something (Car\u00f9 and Cova, 2003). It is not enough that a company simply creates a good experiential context \u2013 it must also and, above all, develop the means to facilitate people\u2019s immersion in this context.\nHOW TO FACILITATE IMMERSION IN AN \nEXPERIENTIAL CONTEXT?\nWhen working on a consumption experience, companies tend to categorize consumers by their level of expertise in a given \ufb01eld, whether the arts, culture, sports, or something else.

After all, the urbanization of our societies \nhas led to a loss of the expertise that used to be transmitted from one generation to the next \u2013 even though, for example, 80 percent of all French households still have at least some gar-den space adjacent to their main residences (source: Promojardin, 2003). This is why \ufb01rms in \nthis sector use a typology categorizing consumers by their competencies, organized around \ufb01fteen main gardening tasks (source: Protocoles, 2001, covering 600 French consumers): 11 \npercent are \u201cexperts,\u201d capable of doing all \ufb01fteen tasks; 36 percent are \u201cadvanced,\u201d capable of doing at least thirteen tasks; 25 percent are \u201caverage,\u201d capable of doing ten tasks; and 28 percent are \u201cnovices\u201d who can do at most six tasks. Whereas experts and many advanced gardeners can dive straight into the sorts of experiential contexts that have been created by \ufb01rms such as Botanic, Jardiland, and T ruffaut (thus quickly accessing the experience), aver-age and especially novice gardeners rarely or never succeed without outside help. As a result, gardening companies, like \ufb01rms in many other sectors, have developed a range of tactics to facilitate average or novice consumers\u2019 immersion into an experiential context: support systems, collective action, and self-determination. These three tactics tend to reduce the mental and/or physical distance that can exist between the consumer and the context of the experience.\nSupport systems\nUsing guides and referents are good ways of providing support. The very idea of having a \nfacilitator who is there to ease consumer immersion into an experiential context is quite pervasive in experiential marketing nowadays (Price et al., 1995).\nSome evoke a guide\u2019s \ufb01gure to express the subtle role that should be played by the par-\nticular staff member who will be present during the course of the immersion operation. Interactive vehicles can also play this consumer guidance role, however, when the immersion operation involves an experiential context, for example. Moreover, a novice\u2019s immersion depends strongly on the \u201cguide\u2019s\u201d ability to act as a quasi-friend, even going as far as to share some intimacy, thereby exceeding consumers\u2019 expectations of this type of service (Price et \nal., 1995). This argues in favor of the development of contact personnel (Puhl et al., 2005) \nto facilitate novices\u2019 immersion. The notion of perceived authenticity is very important here. Immersion will be all the easier when staff members appear to be genuine, i.e., when consumers believe that staff members are doing what they do because they are passionate or feel a sense of vocation, not just because they want to make money. In addition, contact staff members increasingly experience the brands and products that they are promoting in a similarly frenetic manner nowadays. These \u201cpassionate salespersons\u201d are in a better position to respond to customer demands and, above all, to facilitate immersion by replacing the traditional sales talk (attributes/advantages/bene\ufb01ts) by an emotional discourse anchored in their own experiences with the brand (Cova and Cova, 2001). The more a guide gives of him- or herself, the more s/he extracts the experience from the con\ufb01nes of a purely com-mercial exchange, which reassures the novice consumer. In short, contact staff members play a guide\u2019s role, but this should not be confused with the role of a simple master of ceremonies ensuring that the show goes on.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21281626-bd18-45d9-9469-bc4766c02513": {"__data__": {"id_": "21281626-bd18-45d9-9469-bc4766c02513", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed154b52-0eb2-4bc3-820b-25501f978e92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "8009fe1e06e2016146df72ae9a145bdb646eac8ded96a024dc63d029586347b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4dcf5a59-b8c1-45d2-8133-aa2c802188ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "8adaf44d7bbd79a21b59b3a4c3d8ceea29e6774521bd0463339a882f0052a923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef81d6bf-0baa-4b30-925d-e834eab2ca3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f76b4be2a44734f37078437b2c36ea727ff9dfbf45e7e6f8132cfd408ac3a462", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CAR\u00d9 AND COVA\nn 44The role of the referents can be implemented in an experiential context by means of a \nwhole range of vehicles that contact staff members express overtly. It refers to what we \ufb01nd \ntoday in other \ufb01elds, such as the cinema, which is very self-referential and where immersion is facilitated by the recycling and reutilization of referents taken from past \ufb01lms, sometimes involving the total remake or pastiche of a movie (Car\u00f9 and Cova, 2003). What can be recycled are all the signs and symbols relating to a brand or a company, its past, products, key moments, and leading personalities \u2013 all of which the consumer recognizes easily. Depending on the consumer\u2019s own history, which provides him/her with a grid to analyze referents that are being revealed in a particular context, s/he will engage in picking behavior and progres-\nsively appropriate the perimeter of the context. This implies that a \ufb01rm should also mobilize elements derived from other contexts. For example, within the framework of an initiation to classical music, what will be used are images and names coming from more widely known areas such as pop or \ufb01lm music so that the novice consumer has something to hold on to. This utilization of external elements softens the excessive thematization of the context, thus substantiating the views of those who advocate a moderate usage of thematization.\nCollective action\nCollective action involves the development and preservation of communitarian-\ufb02avored \nconnections within an experiential context, thereby allowing for mutual learning and shared emotions. It also means supporting an understanding of (and participation in) the collec-tive microrituals that structure all activities. Firms that think in terms of one consumer\u2019s behavior often neglect the collective dimension of an experience. And yet, the consumption experience needs to be made explicit, explained, and shared if it is to really exist. This is because the attribution of meaning to an individual experience calls for the creation of a narrative that is itself inseparable from the power to say something. An experience is never really complete if it has not been expressed, i.e., as long as it is not been communicated in linguistic or other forms. Whether one has the experience at home or elsewhere, it cannot be separated from ideas such as sharing and collective enjoyment.\nCompanies have therefore recently started to work on immersion\u2019s collective dimension \nby using group interactions to facilitate it. Many \ufb01rms have understood the power of com-\nmunities or tribes in the novice consumer\u2019s immersion (Muniz and O\u2019Guinn, 2001), trying to develop get-togethers where expert, advanced, average, or novice consumers join forces to enable the latter, reassured by the collective atmosphere, to \u201ctest the waters.\u201d The ideas applied here include mutual learning (with the more educated training everyone else) and imitation (with novices copying experts\u2019 gestures). Certain brands such as Ducati or Harley-Davidson focus speci\ufb01cally on creating and preserving brand communities in which novices are taken under the wing of experts, because of the moral obligation of mutual assistance that is de rigueur in such communities (Muniz and O\u2019Guinn, 2001).

Quite the contrary, they should be bumpy and discontinuous, \nfull of private areas and quiet corners that facilitate discrete immersions and small groups of people sharing their emotions.\nEven more recently, companies have rediscovered the power of rituals, despite the fact \nthat consumer behavior research has for twenty years now been emphasizing the importance of rites for consumers\u2019 individual (and especially collective) experiences. This has given us a new vision of consumption, examining it from the standpoint of participation in rituals in which individuals act jointly in a symbolic manner. It remains that rituals in an experiential context do appear to have a relatively ambivalent impact on immersion (Car\u00f9 and Cova, 2003). For example, many of the applause rituals in a classical music concert constitute a real headache for novices, who do not know whether to applaud at the end of a piece. Rituals are (positive or negative) vectors of immersion, and consumers will immerse themselves in a context only if its rituals help them to advance, instead of increasing their sense of distance because they do not understand the rituals.\nSelf-determination\nSelf-determination refers both to training actions (workshops, internships, seminars) that \nenhance consumers\u2019 competencies and to consumers\u2019 agency once they are given the means to apply their own speci\ufb01c competencies. Self-determination is rooted in a vision that equates consumers with protagonists, who are traditionally considered to be operating in reaction to something. The idea here is that consumers are trying to be less passive and injecting a personal touch into their consumption experiences. Self-determination is based on the idea of consumers\u2019 active participation in an experience (Pine and Gilmore, 1999) in their attempts to broadly transcend it. This is quite straightforward for expert consumers who are capable of surmounting any participation proposal that a \ufb01rm may organize, but it can also be a signi\ufb01cant modus operandi for novices, who can use a trial and error type of process to immerse themselves more deeply.\nTraining is the path that is traditionally implemented by companies that rely on consum-\ners\u2019 self-determination to facilitate their immersion (c.f., the concept of edutainment, see \nChapter 10 in this book). By so doing, these \ufb01rms are trying to improve the competencies of consumers, who will then be free to implement these attributes in their own way so as to become increasingly immersed in the experience. The issue here no longer involves guid-ing consumers but instead empowering them so that they can achieve their immersion all by themselves. Hence, the company-driven proliferation of work experiences, workshops, seminars, and distance learning mechanisms to give consumers the wherewithal they need. Many specialized stores even offer veritable classrooms where experts (who can be either company representatives or expert consumers) come to teach novices.\nNevertheless, it appears that the best way forward for any company that wants to in-\ncorporate an element of consumer self-determination is to offer the potential for immer-sion, which is a veritable smorgasbord composed of diffuse elements that consumers shape", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3320, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "654a5ef8-ce90-47f7-bf80-924296c2da10": {"__data__": {"id_": "654a5ef8-ce90-47f7-bf80-924296c2da10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bb654f6-fc8f-42fb-93f7-72b8568e4198", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "d8f693180d2911d94bd2806084a62c235f131e087885bd3b7c18252db1150b9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef81d6bf-0baa-4b30-925d-e834eab2ca3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "46e59c18770600165ba35dde3e33340aede5b2f8dfc57da693279aa54ca3f144", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb9484ee-dc06-48a9-960a-a99ea8ab3899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bca17b2baf1445f73a7b3148c56a4a281f23b6eaa20f322dac70b73e5371b997", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CAR\u00d9 AND COVA\nn 46through their own immersions. The purpose of this kind of approach is not to offer custom-\ners an experience that has been predetermined and structured as part of a scrupulously organized and planned context, but instead to give them an opportunity to achieve autonomy by playing a full role in the design and construction of their own experience, something that goes well beyond merely participating in a planned process. In other words, a company\u2019s vision must transcend simple global program management approaches that envision experi-ence on a point-by-point basis. Instead, it should pursue the more moderate marketing ap-proach that consists of a unifying platform based on which a process, replete with yardsticks and marked here and there by points of reference and readjustment, can unfold in step with the consumer and his/her competencies (Cova and Cova, 2001). In short, consumer self-determination forces companies to clear up some free space within their experiential contexts and not to organize them in their entirety. \u201cThis is the clearly expressed positioning of street festivals, and of most secondary festivals, that give spectators the freedom to choose their own shows and schedules\u201d (Puhl et al., 2005, p. 64).\nCompanies that decide to go down an experiential marketing path should understand \nthat they generally cannot create an experience per se. What they can do, however, is to help consumers access an experience. T o achieve this, they might devise enclavized, the-matized, and secured experiential contexts (such as brands stores, brand plants, brandfests or \nbrand websites) in which consumers can immerse themselves. T o facilitate such an immersion, companies should refocus on what the consumer is actually experiencing, and modulate the assistance they offer to re\ufb02ect his/her levels of competency and expertise. The overall aim of this kind of approach is to generate an increased number of experiential possibilities for the consumer, who can use such occasions to build and consolidate his/her own identity .\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn Why isn\u2019t a consumer\u2019s immersion always immediate and total?\nn What helps consumers to concentrate in an experiential context?\nn What are the limitations of a context\u2019s thematization?\nn Why is a consumer\u2019s immersion facilitated by the implementation of a community \napproach?\nn What difference is there between consumer participation and self-determination?\nREFERENCES\nArnould, E.J. and Thompson, C.J.

All orders of discourse would become the expression of a single ideology that would \nserve to justify society as it is today. The alienated subject would then be absorbed into an alienated existence.\nT o be perfectly clear, this pessimistic view is not the one that the present chapter will \nbe conveying. It is true that, because of their omnipresence, economics and consumption have become the new invisible forces that organize our social living with its beliefs, myths, utopias, temples, and rituals (Belk and Coon, 1993). But instead of hypothesizing alienation or that the consumer society has killed off all that is non-commercial, we prefer talking about a displacement of the traditional borders between the commercial and social spheres, even envisioning a porosity between the two. Much as the degeneration of traditional reli-gious institutions does not in and of itself signify the end of religion, what has occurred in traditional (social, political, cultural) non-commercial spheres and locales does not per se intimate the death of non-commercialism. The microsocial level that the present analysis uses will call for greater optimism in this respect.\nIt is noteworthy, for example, that, despite a certain commercialization of human rela-\ntionships resulting from the commercial sphere\u2019s extension into the social domain (i.e., the increased professionalism of associations and non-government organizations, or volunteer work\u2019s greater institutionalization and focus on the pro\ufb01tability of its actions), in another sense, we are also witnessing the opposite process, namely the decommercialization of the commercial sphere (i.e., fair trade or sustainable development policies). Emerging from this double upheaval are new forms and \ufb01gures, featuring consumers who are less passive and prone to manipulation than they seem, and who in their daily lives pilot their own consump-tion experiences in an autonomous and personalized manner to a surprising extent. More provocatively, we could say that, if modern (and traditional) non-commercialism is dead, long live postmodern non-commercialism!\nThe present chapter will try to show how, for many individuals, the inexorable quest \nfor a better world now entails a new relationship with consumer society. This will involve an analysis of consumer-driven experiences that, albeit linked to the commercial sphere, are also entwined with non-commercialism. In other words, we will be focusing on the experiences of prosumers who take it upon themselves to weave realities that are more human, \ngenuine, and political, but also less commercial, in nature. And what should we do with (and say about) those factors that push organizations toward increased ethical involvement, toward actions with a higher calling, a fairer discourse, and ambitions characterized by a greater sense of citizenship?\nOur vision lies somewhere in the middle of the radical dichotomy that divides this dis-\ncussion into the 100 percent commercial and the 100 percent non-commercial. We will be mixing these two spheres, using as our point of reference a microsocial level that combines commercially oriented actors who want to be less commercial with socially oriented actors who want to encompass commercial logic.

Local youths tied lines of multicolored bal-loons between balconies. People parked their cars elsewhere to make room for a few tables perched on trestles and covered by simple tablecloths.

The main purpose of this initiative would then become economic or political, and it would target ef\ufb01ciency, pro\ufb01tability, and self-interest. The festival would lose its charm as something disinterested, spontaneous, and free, and would be seen as a commercial support system, market space, and opportunity to ask neighbors to make less noise, to negotiate urban plans, and to advertise one\u2019s business. The consumption experi-ence concept moves away from this notion of a dichotomy between the commercial and social spheres and focuses on another form of relationship, one between people and things. This creates mixed relational forms that are no longer entirely non-commercial (social), but not yet entirely commercial.\nIn actual fact, the incursion (or absorption) of the commercial into the non-commercial, \nand vice versa, describes hybrid experiential contexts that can lead to a host of societal innovations: self-managed parental cr\u00e8ches, which are between having relatives or a (profes-sionalized) cr\u00e8che care for one\u2019s children; house exchange associations, which are between spending family holidays at your parents\u2019 house or renting accommodation; local exchange others were happy to sit on a folding chair or sofa. Groups of people came to-\ngether to chat before disbanding. Conversations covered the past and discussed the present. Children ran from one table to another, looking for a pastry or a sandwich. Grown-ups adroitly juggled cardboard plates \ufb01lled with salad or some \ntaboul\u00e9  made by the Moroccan grocer from one street over. No one was shocked \nthat people drank out of disposable cups.\nOver the past four years, the Festival of Buildings has turned into a real tradi -\ntion that no longer requires municipal authorization. The success of an action of this ilk would appear to be strongly tied to a form of spontaneity that is resolute-ly non-institutional in nature. The whole street gets together. Whereas smaller festivities (cocktail parties with one\u2019s neighbors or friends) bring together groups that are socially more homogeneous, neighborhood feasts assemble people from a broader range of generational, socioeconomic, or ethnic backgrounds. In this kind of atmosphere, the symbolism of exchanging food is essential. \u201cThe dishes you bring are a way of introducing and talking about yourself.\u201d\nWhat is important is that local inhabitants can share things, deepen their \nrelationships, and spend some time together chatting and joking.

Underlying each of these innovations is an intention, a desire to live through a non-commercial experience that will interact with a commercial one. LETS exemplify how hard it is to ascertain the commercial or non-commercial nature of consumption experiences that are rooted in the mixing of these two different spheres. For example, from a commercial perspective, LETS can be viewed as a new way of commercializing relations based on mutual assistance amongst neighbors, i.e., as a form of barter, with a services market materializing where there used only to be the favors that friends would do for one another. From a non-commercial perspective, this is reminiscent of the many different forms of communitarian utopia that have tried to recreate social connections via a monetarized exchange of goods and services, the ultimate aim being the disappearance of money so that the connection alone remains. Divergent views on this subject intimate that it constitutes a new form of socialization, somewhere between a society and a community. Our hesitation is more than just theoretical, as for the moment public authorities either opt for the \ufb01rst vision, postulating that this system indirectly constitutes a kind of black market and that LETS should therefore be taxed or else prohibited (as craftsmen often view them as unfair competition), or, inversely, as some municipalities do, encourage their development, because they are construed as networks imbued with social and communitarian practices.\nThese societal innovations show that a material and political culture can make people \naware of the different ways they can co-opt the (commercial and political) systems in which they \ufb01nd themselves. This demonstrates that the distinction between the commercial and non-commercial spheres is no longer very clear-cut and constitutes more of a question of one\u2019s own personal perspective, vision, and stance.\nIntention as a key in understanding CDEs\nAn experience occurs when a subject encounters a reality, keeping said subject informed as \nto the two meanings of the term, i.e., it informs him/her as to the reality itself (\u201cdoing the experience\u201d) but also trains him/her in this reality (\u201chaving the experience\u201d). However, this does not teach us whether the subject of an experience is in fact passive or active. Nor does etymology help us to answer this question, as the Latin verb experiri means both \u201cfeeling\u201d \n(passive) and \u201ctrying\u201d (active). The irreducibly passive component of an experience is what lies at the heart of the company-driven experience \u2013 the mind comes into contact with an external circumstance that it has neither invented or built, and which shapes its experi-ence. However, the experience acquires meaning only through an interpretative activity of the mind. This always implies a certain logic, theory (albeit one that may be false or full of preconceptions), or belief \u2013 in short, an intention.\nIntention (from the Latin intendere, \u201cto tend toward\u201d) is a tension-based concept (Ans-\ncombe, 2000).

Without intention, an act would be no more \nthan a kneejerk reaction. An intention always has a praxeological dimension and is oriented toward an act. It is in the \u201cintention to\u201d do, suggest, and live something non-commercial that CDEs are found. A CDE is only a CDE for the particular awareness that has postulated it because it is the object of an intention.\nA customer\u2019s \u201cintention to\u201d should be distinguished from the notion of motivation that is \nso often used in marketing. Motivation is linked to the individual so that a new equilibrium can be found wherever needs are unsatis\ufb01ed \u2013 whereas intention is linked to an act under the egis of an identity-laden logic, the purpose being to offer meaning (T able 4.1).\nThis narrows the spectrum and casts the spotlight on the consumer. For example, certain \ncompany product or service offers can be construed as uncharted territories, spaces where a CDE might be able to take root \u2013 even if this never happens. The consumer still has the initiative and maintains free choice. Sometimes, these territories remain infertile and uncultivated because the consumer does not grasp their experiential context. On the other hand, CDEs can also crop up without having laid any roots, i.e., without the company having manifested an intention. Rather than an association between company-driven experiences and commercially motivated consumption, on the one hand, or between CDEs and com-mercially motivated consumption, on the other, we think that it is more accurate to envision the consumption experience\u2019s more or less company- or customer-driven orientation in terms of an intention concept. For example, CDEs can and do exist in both commercially and non-commercially motivated experiences.

This struggle can assume different aspects, famously starting with extraordinary political struggles, but also including less well-known ordinary ones.\nCDEs as extraordinary anticommercial experiences\nWhereas young people found their political outlets in the 1960s in Maoism, T rotskyism, \nSituationism, or (for the more conservative of them) Communism or Socialism, today\u2019s rebel youths are antiglobalization and all called Robert Johnson. Their basic discourse is congruent with an anticonsumption CDE, given that it makes references to other protest movements such as Adbusters, Robert Johnson Corporate, Guerriglia Marketing, etc. The foundations and the very existence of such movements refer endlessly to the commercial sphere and also to a consumer society whose boundaries they want to de\ufb01ne and whose development they want to hinder (Zavestoski, 2002). In this struggle, such movements have organized themselves into \ufb02uid structures in which the search for a non-market and com-munitarian experience can constitute a fundamental connection.\nAt a basic level, a CDE is a kind of militant protest. Unlike militants, activists do not work \nfor a political or social organization that aims to run society. They do not want to change the world \u2013 just their own world. They no longer believe in revolutionary utopia. They may be committed, but they also want to preserve their freedom of choice and rebel against any and all institutionalized entities. Theirs is not a structured ideology. They appear to be divorced from all forms of power. Activists do not seek a model. What they want instead are alterna-tives. T o messianic visions, they prefer daily practices that can be invented indeterminately on a daily basis (Kozinets and Handelman, 2004). This activism is not without consequences for the form of the action. Activists operate alone or in small groups that are constituted whenever members meet up physically or virtually in the name of one cause or the other. Commitment is mainly based on groups that have af\ufb01nities with ad hoc objectives that arise in varied and often experimental forms. Activists prefer self-organization. Their investment is ephemeral and cyclical, and it is at this level that it can assume the form of an experience. In fact, some of their forms of action differ from normal expressions of protest, and their staged and mediatized interventions can assume spectacular dimensions. Their acts will be spontaneous, targeted, and festive. The modern protester prefers many small meals to one large one.\nIn this sort of framework, CDEs are speci\ufb01cally characterized by:\nn Their hedonistic nature, the search for pleasure in action and in humor.

The capitalist system has co-opted the various elements of the criticism that used to be aimed at it, with commercial spaces now having canonized Gandhi, Marx, and Che Guevara. Utopia is no longer external (part of another model), nor is it ascribed to an idealized future. T oday, it has a place even within the system and has become a utopia found on one\u2019s street corner, in day-to-day lives.

A whole range of tactics have been designed. Consumers will avoid look-ing at advertising, to the point of tearing them out of magazines. They will boycott brands and chains, take off labels, and buy organic or fair trade products. In sum, they will revisit their entire consumption behavior.

Agn\u00e8s renovates and decorates her \ufb02at with recycled materials (using a partition she tore down as a new wall). She buys only organic materials such as Fermacell (http://www.fermacell.co.uk/), a natural dry lining board for walls, ceilings, and \ufb02oors. She owns a wooden cereal mill so that she can grind or-ganic grains (wheat, barley, red or whole rice, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, rye, etc.) that she keeps in recycled bottles. She purchases washable nappies for her eighteen-month-old child because plastic disposable ones contain toxic substances. She doesn\u2019t have a car and, when she wants to get some fresh air on weekends, she takes the train to her communal allotment. Y et she also has to compromise with the system: \u201cI\u2019m a translator, which is why I have a computer, it\u2019s a tool I need to work. The same applies to the washing machine, I\u2019m forced to compromise. But I don\u2019t have a TV or a car . . . People have to compromise sometimes.

Like other housewives we interviewed, Jocelyne tells us below how and why her shopping experiences have become less commercial in nature.\nJocelyne is a thirty-eight-year-old woman who lives in a village of 1,500 in-\nhabitants located in the southern half of France\u2019s Eure Country. She works at Center Parcs, a holiday complex for urban dwellers who miss the countryside and seek a bucolic experience, offering them chimneys, lakes, forests, exotic swim-ming pools, etc. One day, she noticed that she was losing half a day (including transportation time) going shopping at a hypermarket 15 km from her home. \nShe also realized that she was not able to control herself when faced with the \nover\ufb02owing product displays in outlets \u201cthat make me buy things I don\u2019t need and have to store in the cupboard.\u201d She therefore decided to use the Internet and organize a home delivery service. After three months, her online merchant told her that, as she was the only customer in her part of the county, it could no longer justify servicing her. \u201cIt was when I got turned out, \ufb01red by this company, that I realized that something was wrong in the world . . ..\u201d\nEverything changed when Jocelyne decided to start going to a small grocery \nstore in her village. \u201cIt was totally different, family-run, close to me, I was supporting our local village, it was a totally different dimension . . . Now that \nthe grocer knows that I go shopping every Saturday, she orders things for me \nthat she didn\u2019t offer before . . . I\u2019m actually gaining time and money and am \nno longer tempted to buy more than I need, besides I couldn\u2019t, even if I wanted \nto . . . Compared with those huge, cold commercial structures, it is much more human, less commercial and also I\u2019ve made social contacts in my village . . . It\u2019s \nonly a bother when the grocer goes away on holidays since then I have to go \nback to the hypermarket . . .

Of course, Jocelyne did not know this.\nCDES AS NEW SPACES OF INTERACTION WITH THE \nMARKET: INTERCOMMERCIALIZATION\nFar from allowing themselves to be benignly manipulated (as the popular image of trickery \nunderlying the company-driven experience would have it), but also far from manipulating the company (as anticommercialization CDEs would have it), consumers can simply juggle with commercialization without falling prey to it. They can use complicity and malice to play around with the supplier\u2019s product offer. In this view, consumers are not at all naive about experiential strategies of this ilk. As they know they are being partially manipulated, they can choose to what extent this is being done to them and work around the manipulation so that it ends up complementing their daily existence (Cova and Cova, 2000). Instead of a direct confrontation with the commercial system, they can show some sleight of hand.\nIntercommercialization manifests the estheticization of the experience being lived \nthrough by consumers who can devise for themselves, alone or as part of a group (and often acting from the wings), a zone of ephemeral and limited autonomy within the commercial system, without consciously associating any oppositional attitudes with their actions. They identify and decode what the commercial system has organized so as to be able not only to get around it but also to tame it so they can love it. After all, passion is a major driver behind these experiences. These playful intercommercialization CDEs can arise in more or less formalized contexts ranging from associative to imaginary modes.\nCDEs in an associative context\nMany collective experiences tend to have their own way with the commercial system. Exam-\nples include fan associations committed to (and involved in) traditionally non-commercial activities (spelling, weather, genealogy, heritage, or open air pursuits) that dig up and pre-serve products from the past (i.e., French vintage car fans such as the G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 2 CV , http://\nwww.generation2cv.org/;  or Confr\u00e9rie des 650 groups, www.confreriedes650.org/).

The troupe wants to be a hodgepodge of meetings and exchanges, promoting a cross-fertilization of everyone\u2019s past histories, dreams, doubts, and hopes. It tries to mediate between the written and oral arenas, and between those who talk and those who listen. Everyone is free to construct his/her own artistic experience in a space that people visit not so that they can con-sume an activity but, rather, so that they can get involved in an act of creation. This space is characterized by a perpetual back and forth of movement; by the giving of gifts (and receiving of others in return); and by sharing. It is a veritable melting pot. The theater blurs the borders between spectators and players, and between actors and their roles. For example, every participant in its amateur workshop crafts a singular account conveying his/her own experiences, and writ-ing and playing their own stories. As such, each participant becomes the au-thor\u2013actor of his/her own past. In this sense, actor and director Michel Andr\u00e9\u2019s work is not isolated from daily life, but instead very much a part of it. This is not an innocent approach. Its subtext hides people\u2019s refusal to allow themselves to be dominated and contaminated by the commercial system. Compagnie de la Cit\u00e9 is a place where pretences explode. For Michel Andr\u00e9, this helps people to \u201chave a better understanding of the contrast between our inner nature and what we show the outside world whenever we \ufb01nd ourselves being in\ufb02uenced by a society that is constantly and increasingly forcing us to try and look like it.\u201d In other words, this is an ongoing search based on the sincere and shared emotion that each indi-vidual should be able to live and weave his/her own experience.\nCompagnie de la Cit\u00e9\u2019s dependency on subsidies, precarious resources, and \nvulnerability to the strictures of its associative structure are all factors of fragil-ity. To cope, survive, and thrive, it counts on its ability to get around commercial constraints; avoid relationships based on self-interest; and not give into com-mercial temptations. Experiences of this sort, which participants can have when they \ufb01nd themselves functioning in an associative mode, \ufb02irt with the commer-cial world even as they try to emancipate themselves from it entirely. People\u2019s intentions are full of passion \u2013 there is nothing commercial about passion, be it from an individual standpoint (I put on plays because it\u2019s useful to me) or from a collective one (I put on plays to defend some social cause or the other). Self-interest does not enter the equation. The experience is \ufb01rst and foremost a shared instance, one that places itself on the edges of the commercial sphere without casting a shadow over it.

From its very outset, this \nmovement has worked to rede\ufb01ne commercial/non-commercial relationships. In its varying avatars, the sector has often tried to de\ufb01ne a different type of commercial functioning, one that reintegrates strong social relations by putting people through experiences that are more authentic and natural in tone. This is not some attempt to \ufb02ee the market or to struggle against it. Instead, it is a desire to interact with the market, using its rules to create spaces that are less commercial (and even non-commercial).\nCDEs in an imaginary form\nIn intercommercialization CDEs, consumers are free to decide to what extent they will be \ntricked in their consumption experience, narrating their own (mostly non-commercial) sto-ries about the product, brand, or company. Unlike the established creed in marketing, it is essential neither that all of the messages that a company sends to the market be coherent nor that all such messages mesh with reality. It is possible for a gap to exist between a company\u2019s identity and the image it projects in the market. This gap can create a positive role by gener-ating a greater space of freedom for the consumer (Voss and Giraud-Voss, 2000). Consum-ers often prefer ambiguity to clarity in a company\u2019s image. As such, intercommercialization CDEs can accommodate both a whole host of consumption re-enchantment initiatives as well as hyper-reality. The consumer does not need everything to be true and coherent.\nThe Provence markets example (de la Pradelle, 2006) illustrates the extent to which in-\ntercommercialization CDEs are rooted in the imaginary. The atmosphere surrounding these playful interactions is omnipresent and offers a communitarian ambience. The market offers a stage for the pleasure of meeting up with friends, a feeling that is supposedly characteristic of traditional societies. Here, people bene\ufb01t from anonymity, the fact that they know one another and the ease with which relationships can be created or unwound. Estheticism and authenticity create what the author calls \u201cthe commerce of the imaginary,\u201d composed of \u201crounder pumpkins\u201d or \u201ca typical p\u00e2t\u00e9 for you.\u201d This engenders a seduction-based economy in which people cultivate \u201cthe art of taking your time\u201d and wandering about. As they run into each other, they start to watch this \u201cfestival time\u201d spectacle, which constitutes a break from their daily lives. The market invites people to follow a certain course, one in which hesitation (and even versatility) become useful commodities. More than price, choice, or quality, what is important here is the market\u2019s ambience and friendly atmosphere, and the fact that its authenticity-based exchanges are run according to a non-commercial mode. Liking markets means accepting from the very beginning that people will be able to lure you into their traps, even if you don\u2019t believe them. It also means agreeing to be dragged into their imaginary commercial world by means of paralipsis, a mode wherein people pretend not to want, think, say, or do something they clearly want to think, say, or do.\nIn a sense, an intercommercialization CDE asks consumers to mobilize speci\ufb01c com-\npetencies and is anchored in their freedom of choice and ability to create an experience autonomously within a given experiential context.

The meaning and \nusage that consumers create are more akin to poaching and cherry-picking than they are to any programming.\nCONCLUSION\nCDEs are geared toward situations in which consumers act as autonomous protagonists liv-ing their consumption experiences when, where, and how they desire. Whether this involves anticommercialization CDEs, more or less extraordinary protest experiences, intercom-mercialization CDEs, or more or less imaginary playful experiences, CDEs have the particu-larity of being engendered by one and only one intention, that of the consumer him/herself. Y et this intention is not utopian in nature, given that it draws from the consumer\u2019s ability to project himself/herself as the actor. The CDE may be a question of getting the customer to live through an experience that has been designed, staged, and piloted by the company \u2013 but in a CDE, customers design  their own experience, above and beyond the traditional \nnotion of customer participation as encapsulated in the company-driven experience. Here, the consumption experience does not stem from the offer of an experience that the \ufb01rm is marketing, but is generated instead by the consumer him/herself, in accordance with his/her intentions, on the occasion of those interactions that s/he will be living through with the thing (product or service) on offer, or with any staff members or other persons who may be present.\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn What driven experiences do you find when you analyze your daily consumption?\nn How do these driven experiences relate to the market?\nn Why is the consumer intention level the most relevant one for apprehending \ncustomer-driven experiences?\nn Based on which elements can companies try to respond to customer-driven \nexperiences?\nn In light of these customer-driven experiences, do you consider it more relevant to \ntalk about society\u2019s commercialization or the market\u2019s socialization?\nREFERENCES\nAnscombe, G.E.M.

Individuals are continuously engaged in the symbolic ap-propriation of goods and services, and use them to construct their own individual identity (Miller, 1995). Through these symbolic transformation and recontextualization processes, goods can become the means of reappropriating the identities of both individuals and social groups.\nObviously, the capacity for recontextualization is not synonymous with the complete \nautonomy of the consumers who, with their own work on the purchased object, must deal with the object\u2019s history, with the remnants of meaning sedimented in the layers of mean-ing through which it has passed, and with the persons involved in the process of validation and sharing of their appropriation rituals and, therefore, in their collective consumption experiences.\nSocial relations de\ufb01ne consumption experiences.

Young Italians have developed a close relationship with pasta because of its intrinsic characteristics (it is versatile, natural, healthy, and inexpensive) and its symbolic values (traditional food, temptation, social glue). T o a signi\ufb01cant degree, these meanings depend on the consumption experiences in which indi-viduals have interacted with their culture, linking their knowledge to episodes, people, and places which together constitute the narrative framework for describing the relationship between young Italians and pasta.\nThe results of the processes of decommodi\ufb01cation and the retranslation of the meanings \nof the product are clear. Individuals have decisively distanced themselves from the com-munication protocols typical of production and mass communication in favor of social and cultural relationships and the recollection of the emotional components of a consumption experience.\nAlthough advertising is one of the main means through which meanings are transferred \nfrom the culturally constructed world to consumption objects (McCracken, 1986), in this case, its role is marginal because of the subjects\u2019 appropriation work in meaning-making.\nPASTA IN THE CONSUMPTION CULTURE OF THE \nITALIANS\nIt is dif\ufb01cult to think of pasta simply as one of the typical foodstuffs of Italian cooking, \ncreated from \ufb02our and water, molded into various shapes, dried, cooked in boiling salted water, and seasoned in a variety of ways. In Italy, pasta is a social phenomenon; it is part of the culture of a people and has profound links to their history, their geography, and, above all, their lifestyle.\nT oward the end of the 1950s, Italians became more prosperous after the poverty and \nhardship of the prewar and wartime years. The country was gradually being rebuilt and re-formed into a modern and prosperous nation. Italians \u2013 spectators, architects, and builders of the economic miracle \u2013 were transformed from a life of rural poverty into a relatively af-\n\ufb02uent society of mass consumption. Widespread prosperity altered the collective mentality: material aspirations grew, the economic and cultural implications of consumption changed, and the function of goods as aids in building the identity of individuals and de\ufb01ning their role in society became widespread.\nThis process necessarily involved food. Now that the specter of famine had receded, the \nincrease in family incomes led to the widespread conversion from traditional and frugal foodstuffs to the edible symbols of opulence (Vercelloni, 1998).\nIn the collective imagination during the boom, pasta was seen as a food for the poor,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3215, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f86cf61d-295c-41c3-bc00-e2ae18aee564": {"__data__": {"id_": "f86cf61d-295c-41c3-bc00-e2ae18aee564", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b3f30f5-e4da-42af-af35-f0833e30ce51", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b9fab700e501b84347b1665dd7e45cf63329e07c247f249540bf94229b6422fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41c81783-02b4-42a1-a70a-4d1143f9c659", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "8db52dde2bfb6d8b1f8c5e91467d250dce23a2a4e516b2fd120c14aaa41e26ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d31106f-ee33-4c4b-b1b6-f05fdf9b479d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eaa1cd7cf834659c66ae3d7d29a736467a194aa6416006466cd1939a1401fbbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCES AND PRODUCT MEANINGS\n67 ndenigrated and believed to be of little nutritional value.

As it was no longer eaten in the most developed \ncountries, it was accused of provincialism, as well as of having no gastronomic quality. Guides to etiquette even forbade its use at elegant dinners. Pasta was further tainted by the fact that it was a food of the common people, an embarrassing hangover from poor rural Italy, in contrast to meat, a true object of social aspiration. Worse still, pasta was condemned as an example of bad nutrition, a presumed source of weight gain.\nVercelloni (1998, p. 979)\nThese negative stereotypes began to fade in the 1970s, and a central role in this change \nmust be attributed to the \u201cinvention\u201d of the Mediterranean diet (Keys and Keys, 1975). This was to have the bene\ufb01t of promoting pasta in the rest of Europe and America, making its main nutritional bene\ufb01ts known, while destroying other prejudices.\nPasta then began to gather ever greater social support in Italy, signi\ufb01cantly from the \nmost cultured and innovative segments of the population. From the beginning of the 1980s, the image of pasta changed. Its nutritional value was rede\ufb01ned, its cultural meaning was reinforced, and its role as a building block of national identity was legitimized. This came about partly as a result of the glori\ufb01cation of pasta in the Mediterranean diet and partly with a rediscovered sense of national pride, of which a return to pasta was a part.\nThe most recent Italian market data (source: Cirm, 2003, 2004) show that, on average, \nItalians consume about 28 kg of pasta a year, in 85-g portions, at least \ufb01ve times a week. The most common recipes are the traditional ones (spaghetti with tomato sauce, macaroni with meat sauce), even if every Italian knows twelve pasta recipes well and tries six new ones ev-ery year. Consumers keep an average of 5 kg of pasta in stock, in at least \ufb01ve different shapes, of which two are brand names. Short pasta is preferred to long pasta but, for 36.7 percent of Italians, the shape does not matter. Instead, they choose between smooth or ribbed pasta, with a clear preference for the ribbed. Nevertheless, Italians are traditionalists, and the most popular pasta shapes are spaghetti followed by penne, with rigatoni, macaroni, and fusilli some way behind. These \ufb01ve shapes account for 77.5 percent of the pasta consumed.\nPASTA AND ITS MAIN MEANINGS\nThe primary purpose of this study is to describe the meanings that young consumers as-sociate with pasta.

The collages often showed couples, families, and happy and radiant groups having fun cooking and eating together. Other collages included people of different ethnic origins to show the versatility and global nature of pasta.\nDomesticity\nAlthough pasta originated as a street food (the \ufb01gure of the maccaronaro, who for a modest \nsum served the passer-by a dish of steaming macaroni at any time of the day, was a symbol of Naples in the late 1800s), it developed in the home; pasta became the \ufb01rst in the series of courses that made up the meal. Both the collages and the written documents make refer-ence to all the elements and accessories related to cooking. Pots, colanders, ladles, forks, and spoons take on a symbolic dimension because of their link with the product. They represent a culture in which preparing and consuming food at home has great importance.\nThe difference between pizza and pasta, the two foodstuffs typical of Italy, is that pizza \nis a dry food with a topping, while pasta is a food with liquid (La Cecla, 1998). Pizza has a public role; it can be eaten on the street, even without a plate, while pasta needs to be eaten mainly in the home, with family and friends. It is the most typical home-cooked product, made by the mother for the family, requiring knowledge of cooking and sauce preparation, as well as a private atmosphere.\nItalianness\nItaly is usually identi\ufb01ed abroad by its artistic and cultural heritage. Although they know about and are proud of these national treasures, many young people also identify pasta as an important symbol of their national identity. Pasta is an expression of their material culture; the collages included maps of Italy, the Italian \ufb02ag, and the word \u201cItalia\u201d, and even natural environments and artistic treasures.\nThe associations described above impose a symbolism on pasta which seems to be tied \nto the essential elements of the individual and collective identity of the Italian consumer. It satis\ufb01es taste and gives pleasure; it is a common denominator of Italian culture; and it plays many different, positive and gratifying, roles.\nPasta and personal experience: the family and pasta, friends and \npasta\nPasta brings to the mind of young consumers their \ufb01rsthand experiences.

There are no direct or indirect references to the role of manufacturing \nor of advertising (the market system) in the creation of the experience itself. This results in the decommercialization of the product and the rede\ufb01nition of some of its meanings; individuals reappropriate the consumption process, partly removing it from the ideology of the market (see Chapter 3 in this volume).\nFrom this point of view, the experiences described by the students can be classi\ufb01ed on \nthe basis of the social contexts in which they take place \u2013 with the family and with friends.\nThe family and pasta\nAs con\ufb01rmation of its versatility, pasta is involved in various family rituals, from the most simple and everyday to those of great importance and depth (Rook, 1985).

The consumption experience takes on a particular signi\ufb01cance in the light of the social bonds that it helps to strengthen. Eating together allows people, within certain limits, to articulate their identity and to de\ufb01ne their role with regard to others. This is why eating pasta alone is not seen by young people as positive.\nPasta often plays a role in lifestyle changes, for example leaving home to study in another \ncity. In this case, the classic problem of new responsibilities and tasks presents itself, includ-ing shopping and cooking, previously undertaken by other members of the family. Here pasta, linked to family experiences and the techniques learnt from mother or grandmother, takes on a fundamental role in the de\ufb01nition of a new identity:\nIt was all perfect apart from a perhaps not completely irrelevant detail.

Despite the fact that the individual episodes of consump-tion belong to the most simple and repetitive part of daily life, over time they overlap and determine a highly subjective structure of meanings strongly linked to the culture of belong-ing, to people\u2019s history, and to their social network. It is in this context that the experiential dimension (Addis and Holbrook, 2001) of the pasta consumption experiences of young Italians should be understood.\nVery generally, the sensorial experience is tied to the product\u2019s attributes and its immedi-\nate effects. Flavors, recipes, and sauces, combined with the variety of possible occasions for preparation and consumption, make eating pasta a unique and always new experience, but one that is at the same time integrated in previous experiences and culture.\nYoung consumers clearly display a knowledgeable and explicit ability to link pasta and its \nattributes to elements of their culture. Pasta is a symbol of Italy in the world and, along with other values, it is one of the elements that constitute national identity, both in Italy, where it uni\ufb01es, as well as abroad, where it symbolizes Italy and Italians. It respects the values assigned to food and can be seen in different ways in the debate on the healthiness of the Mediterranean diet (Keys and Keys, 1975).\nFurthermore, the experience of consuming pasta has important social implications. Our \ninformants were well aware of the rules and principles that underlie the preparation and consumption of pasta in different contexts. Whether alone, in the midst of the family, with friends, or with one\u2019s partner, preparation and consumption take on different content and values.\nIn this sense, the experience of consuming pasta is always sustained by the cultural and \nsocial fabric. It cannot be reduced to a simple relationship between consumer and product, as demonstrated by the fact that occasions when subjects talk of eating pasta alone are considered in a negative light. Rather, in the vast majority of cases, eating pasta is an impor-tant meeting point of individual, social, and cultural values where individual identity can be af\ufb01rmed and one\u2019s social position established.\nThis is also con\ufb01rmed by the fact that the events related in the introspective documents \ngenerally refer not to the particularity of pasta as such, but to the social relations within which pasta is consumed. This implies that the respondents see pasta mainly as a sort of social glue, a unifying element in interpersonal experiences. All of this brings to mind the concept, so dear to the sociologists of food, of a \u201cproper meal,\u201d de\ufb01ned as cooked, hot food served as the main meal of the day and eaten with the entire family gathered around the dinner table (Charles and Kerr, 1988). Independently of the composition and nutritional characteristics of this dish, what is signi\ufb01cant is its contribution to the construction of the family, to the de\ufb01nition of the relationships between the various components of the family nucleus, and to the construction and expression of their individual identities.

These experiences are not \nintense or revolutionary; they do not lead to fully \ufb02edged transformations. For all Italians, pasta is a material and cultural object about which they know almost everything. It is con-sumed almost daily and does not cause deep or radical change. Nevertheless, every single consumption episode is accompanied by symbolic and emotional values and past experi-ences; this emerges clearly from the research data.\nWe also highlight the importance attributed by the participants to cooking the pasta. \nYoung consumers are knowledgeable and competent pasta cooks and, in this way, show the peculiar postmodern trend in consumption, as predicted by de Certeau (1984).\nDespite the fact that pasta is \u201cthreatened\u201d by precooked products, the consumption \nculture seems to be strongly anchored in a model in which the goodness of the product and, therefore, the fullness of the consumption experience derive from the correct organization of the cooking. These are not exclusively instrumental (cooking a good dish of pasta), but rather social \u2013 they allow individuals to compare and exchange ideas, meanings, and memo-ries. As in other sectors (Ladwein, 2003), the preparation and consumption of the product/service are often part of the same ritual, and both contribute to the \ufb01nal satisfaction.\nBecause the cooking is so important, consumers assign themselves ownership of the \n\ufb01nished product. Pasta is made of \ufb02our and water, and it is thanks only to the creative touch and skill of the cook that it is transformed into a memorable consumption experience. In this sense, cooks take on the values and meanings of the product, often modifying, renewing, and transforming their signi\ufb01cance. Recipes combine special ingredients to transform and decommodify purchased products.\nBy co-opting mass-produced brand-name products in creating a meal, the cook demon-\nstrates that familial values can triumph over the powerful homogenizing in\ufb02uences of con-sumer culture (Wallendorf and Arnould, 1991, p. 28). Brand-name products are reclaimed from the world of commodities and reassembled into traditions and daily practices. Through such transformation processes, individuals de\ufb01ne their immanent productive power, their ability to produce for others.\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn Do you think it\u2019s possible to create a memorable experience with a convenience \nproduct?\nn What are the most experience-favorable characteristics of a convenience \nproduct?\nn How do consumers manage to daily reconstruct the meanings of convenience \nproducts?\nn In what sense do consumers perceive some convenience products as a means of \ninterpersonal interaction?\nn What is the role of preparation in the experience of consuming pasta?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2929, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee110059-4e93-4ea9-8b9d-f95b1ba73509": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee110059-4e93-4ea9-8b9d-f95b1ba73509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f81927b-d643-4d9a-bd60-dac2705f3711", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "f58fe87ab7044b355ea41db5a2ff70ba81ac195a08a0f5404f5a723890608b57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92c9c034-01e6-43d9-a306-23dabb6584b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "728242651cccada9607f3611f797c86c5a5360935b3ede827c7af488fa6e7d47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9f1318d-e4f4-4eac-ac35-15c2af4bd771", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "085347aa827d90030a4f62a8b657cd50ae12e21c008d13a62e5a75505b4b0c2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DALLI AND ROMANI\nn 78REFERENCES\nAddis, M. and Holbrook, M.B.

Moreover, when people \nevoke products, they are often referring to sign systems. The semantic approach makes a clear distinction between the material dimensions of objects (the signi\ufb01er or the expressive level) and their idea-related dimension (the signi\ufb01ed or the contents level). This perspec-tive analyzes objects in terms of their speci\ufb01cally ideological dimension, to the detriment of their corporal and sensorial dimensions. Have the instrumental and symbolic dimensions that are traditionally associated with objects in our western culture put paid to all other pos-sibilities for ascribing coherence and meaning to objects \u2013 despite the fact that these other possibilities continue to crop up, as if by stealth, in people\u2019s daily lives? But how is it then that objects are still able to surprise us time and again, enchanting us despite the familiar place they have in our daily lives? By no longer focusing only on the symbolic dimensions of products and brands, the experientialization of consumption may pave the way for an approach that will do a better job of incorporating the speci\ufb01cally material embeddedness of our relationships with objects. Now is probably the time both to try and understand the infraordinary mode that surrounds us, and also to transcend the saturation of the effects on our senses as well as the tyranny of symbolism. Both these factors have imprisoned objects in a register that tends to empty them of their meaning and emotionality, and very probably of their effectiveness. The present chapter aims to reveal insights into the objects that surround us on a daily basis, insights that will marginalize the commonplace and the spectacular, and help show how our daily experiences with such objects epitomize a sort of constant iteration KEY POINTS\nn An object is more than a mere system of signs.\nn A consumption experience can be broken down into four essential modes.\nn The experiences we engage in with objects can be analyzed at different \nlevels, ranging from the substantial to the interactional.\nn An object can be seen as a real partner in a consumer\u2019s life.\nn An object\u2019s banality and blandness constitute experiential principles in and \nof themselves.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2342, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10adddf7-19b7-4c12-ba44-0a8fec915829": {"__data__": {"id_": "10adddf7-19b7-4c12-ba44-0a8fec915829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1d9d10a-aec8-402f-b313-40d2df6f84d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "4848d9a446985bde21e26de80824034b71a79e38493a91625aa063b389bd9fe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9f1318d-e4f4-4eac-ac35-15c2af4bd771", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "97016df60211fb294a67dcefbae1354f5153f1567a81d5e9aae2015121b2cc0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e6df465-29af-468c-b2ff-64492113221f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aabc8b323fd694467086a9d0a68ed4d2421d954137ec74a38a54845c9904b97b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HEILBRUNN\nn 80with the moral and physical constraints of daily living (Kaufmann, 1997). The idea argued \nhere is that, to understand key issues in marketing, and to truly reacquaint ourselves with consumers\u2019 actual experiences, we will have to go beyond the rhetorical and the spectacular \ufb01elds that have become so intrinsic to commercialization.\nTHE DISENCHANTMENT OF AN OBJECT\nThe excessive semanticization of consumer goods has caused an irreversible shift in the analysis of objects. Whereas objects were viewed as material entities, now they are seen as systems of signi\ufb01cation. We could even say that, ever since Baudrillard\u2019s seminal work in this \ufb01eld, studies here have continually analyzed the signi\ufb01er in terms of the signi\ufb01ed, thus destroying the material and sensorial dimensions of objects. It is clear that an object will at the very least speak to us and tell us about the various ways in which it can be used:\nA pocket knife always says more about the person who owns it . . . In our opinion, it is legitimate to imagine that a knife\u2019s handle can be extended by the various ways people use it, and that this ultimately attests to a certain way of living and being. By broaching the question in this manner . . . we are trying to identify if not a culture . . . then at least a form of thinking and a particular mode of interaction between oneself and the world.\n(Floch, 1995, p. 181)\nIn other words, pocket knives are mountain knives that suggest one and only one response for each function, a generalist that seems to be telling users, \u201cSort yourselves out.\u201d Inversely, a Swiss army knife that acts like a specialist by offering a speci\ufb01c answer for each type of utilization seems to be telling its users to \u201cGo ahead\u201d (Floch, 1995).\nThis raises questions as to the role played by a speci\ufb01cally sensorial and corporal experi-\nence in the choice and utilization of an object. After all, experiential marketing orchestrates a constant scenarization, which can readily intimate that signs have become the principal suppliers of meaning and therefore of enjoyment, reducing consumption or interaction to a semiotic experience. Is it possible that marketing\u2019s undeniable capacity for theatricalization has been replacing senses with signs by obliterating the sensoriality and gesturality with which all experience is necessarily imprinted? We can turn this question around by wonder-ing aloud whether an object is capable of provoking affection, feelings, and emotions.\nIn actual fact, this constitutes one of anthropology\u2019s main criticisms of the semiotics \nof objects. An object cannot be reduced to a system of signs, because social signi\ufb01cations are not the only things that it conveys. In other words, an object will not always be bogged down in cultural and social signi\ufb01cations that inexorably cause an a priori determination of its senses and functions. It can also be appropriated by individuals and strengthened using signi\ufb01cation and personal values even as it refers to something other than its utilization value or its value as a social sign. The big risk of equating an object with a quasi-language is that, once the signi\ufb01ed has been identi\ufb01ed, the signi\ufb01er becomes surplus to requirements. After that, an object will no longer be seen as anything more than a simple system of connotative signs that run at high emotional temperatures (Eco, 1985).

In other words, structural and semantic approaches to objects can be criticized as being reductionist. This is because they ignore materiality per se, in terms of its relationship both to the construction of the subject and to its objecti\ufb01cation within action.\nReducing a material object to a sign or \u201cquasi-word\u201d means that material culture tends \nto be viewed as a \u201csimple twinning of discourses\u201d (Warnier, 1999, p. 124). In other words, by replacing objects with words, semiotics seems to be depriving itself of everything that is original about a substance, in particular its ability to structure and diversify instruments of action or its environment, thus shaping the subject in a way that cannot be reduced to mere discourse. At the same time, by manipulating objects, a subject becomes embodied, expressing itself through gestures and substance, hence the irreducibility of the material expression, something that becomes particularly necessary whenever discourse no longer has the words to describe this. Even if some objects could be translated into words (as a result of their structural and communicational dimensions), their most opaque substrata rebel against notional and verbal expression, even though they represent a powerful factor for building subject and meaning.\nAnd yet, modern humankind seems to suffer when faced with an object. At a time when \ntechnological progress has enabled almost all conceivable combinations of the forms, mate-rials, and colors that are now possible, objects scarcely provide any more the kind of initial resistance that once explained their charm. The in\ufb01nite malleability that design offers has detracted from the objects themselves, insofar as the profusion of objects has tended to empty them of their signifying substance.\nObjects become sorts of slaves, having lost their nobility, as we are told, in the service \nof humankind. They have become too obvious, too familiar, and too docile. T o what extent can they continue to surprise and amuse us? What awaits and threatens an object is a real neglect stemming from the continuous rationalization of the production and consumption processes. This sort of disenchantment with the world of objects basically harks back to the mass production of objects and to the ensuing depersonalization of contacts (how can we have a personal contact with an object that is replicated ad in\ufb01nitum?). As Max Weber pointed out, this process of disenchantment with the world is one in which spontaneity, idiosyncrasy, and superstition have been erased and replaced by values such as effectiveness, predictability, and replicability. Here, the consumption object appears to be abundant and at the same time in shortage. It is abundant because of the profusion of objects in individuals\u2019 daily lives (people supposedly encounter 20,000\u201330,000 objects in just one day). It is in shortage because the profusion of objects, resulting from their repeated production, tends to empty them of their signifying substance. Now, an object can exist only if it entertains a relationship of signi\ufb01cation with its user. It must necessarily be imbued with values super-seding its function alone. When rede\ufb01ned thus, an object (with its substance and meaning) carries with it a past and a future. More speci\ufb01cally, it is able to scenarize consumption by projecting it into a universe that is rich with meaning and emotion. We feel that this is what imbues an experience with its full meaning, signifying here a transformation process, as well as people\u2019s ability to use the power of objects to become something different.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3769, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecd51eb3-a904-48e0-9ee5-c1996ec08ea6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecd51eb3-a904-48e0-9ee5-c1996ec08ea6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "78b3f07b-c0e6-4161-8b15-093abb606930", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "2ed57a073e1e4eb68b1170f0cd6640099e3b8ea7db43649d814c3b7705a81311", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e6df465-29af-468c-b2ff-64492113221f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "4773275dc3f2f3b54151be20407609e1847b6c2a4679c2a439e7d66bc2a47bf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fe8dfb2-6099-4bef-b813-4b79568b9bc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a9cae49da0173a14ed5ed11915f26afbfe86a04e2170c8f9eac89e1e0c3e4c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HEILBRUNN\nn 82OBJECTS, BETWEEN ROUTINE AND SURPRISE\nPeople have relatively paradoxical expectations of the objects that make up their daily lives. \nIn turn, these expectations evoke a repetitive \ufb02ow of actions taking a simple psychological approach that views an object in terms of its utilitarian purposes, and also expresses people\u2019s desire to be surprised and enchanted when objects become endowed with a certain mystery, magic, and even aura. An object takes part in a sort of reassuring routinization of gestures, incarnating a form that incorporates the object into daily gestures and ensures an embodi-ment in one\u2019s daily actions. Individuals wield undeniable control over the objects they use. This allows them to control their environment, notably their interpersonal environment. Thus, in terms of an object\u2019s instrumental functions, we should not forget the crucial value of freedom that is associated with material ownership, and speci\ufb01cally makes it possible to predict a result and to experiment with causal ef\ufb01ciency and control (Furby, 1978). In short, the most salient bene\ufb01t that an object offers is very probably the fact that it can be controlled, as this makes it possible to characterize ownership, regardless of the age of the person involved (Furby, 1978). Objects constitute benchmarks for an individual\u2019s identity and truth. Thus, routine is the vehicle that will enable the individual to live in an illusion of stability such as seen in the devotion to household chores (Kaufmann, 1997).\nAbove and beyond the control function, an object contributes to emotional stability, as \nthe environment it creates is a familiar one. Some children, for example, can eat only from a plate that is familiar to them. Similarly, some adults feel at home anywhere as long as they can listen to their usual music on their iPod: objects help to garnish an emotional screen that makes people feel secure. A child never feels alone when his/her teddy bear is around, and the same can be said of many adults with some of their favorite objects. Objects accompany us in many different ways (Tisseron, 1999), for example by offering children a training pitch where they can practice potentialities that will be of use to them for later interpersonal relationships, such as patience or the ability to test one\u2019s own limits when encountering an obstacle. An object can speci\ufb01cally mollify the tensions that are created by life in society, one example being when pupils use pocket knives to carve complaints about school life in their wooden desks. Objects also surprise us when they break down or when incidents occur that transform the continuous and monotonous thread of our daily lives into a major event. At the same time, even the most familiar objects can be imbued with different values enabling an emotional release. Such values can be based on varying emotional registers such as contemplation, nostalgia, connection, self-projection, etc. T o understand this intrinsic ambivalence in our relationship to an object, maybe we should shift the starting blocks that determine our representation of an object or an experience (often by subjecting this representation to the sort of logic that applies to major events) and envision other modes for relating to an object.\nCASE VIGNETTE 6.1: ALESSI\u2019S \u201cOBJECT-GAMES\u201d\nThe Italian \ufb01rm Alessi, which has been making kitchen utensils for three genera-\ntions now, is a prime illustration of what the poet Francis Ponge calls \u201cobject-", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fe8dfb2-6099-4bef-b813-4b79568b9bc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fe8dfb2-6099-4bef-b813-4b79568b9bc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a8d8e9c-fbfa-4772-a865-8544d7d9c756", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "5b5dc0a1e860cf551a5fdcdd9b452fd49b4f63c5ec5a527979b239885e77bda5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecd51eb3-a904-48e0-9ee5-c1996ec08ea6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "2ed57a073e1e4eb68b1170f0cd6640099e3b8ea7db43649d814c3b7705a81311", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfab52c1-8959-481e-884c-b5e6cf56d5da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49dd87b5c59f2bb96b705f56d2d47cb5873338fb32d6beae5f8cad44a58b540b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE BLANDNESS AND DELIGHTS OF A DAILY OBJECT\n83 nFROM SUBSTANCE TO INTERACTION\nIf objects play such an important role in our lives, it is because they occupy a physical space, \na symbolic space, a mental space (by \ufb01lling our minds with dilemmas about choice, utiliza-tion, storage, and rejection), and a temporal space \u2013 as well as a mixture of sensations and emotions.

It remains that the experience of an object evokes, above and beyond any sensorial imprint, a universe of consumption that is emotionalized and socialized (Boutaud, 2004). In short, our relationship to objects always more or less mediates a relationship to someone else. We distinguish between two main ways of relating to an object, relationships that are in fact never entirely independent of one another:\nn An autospheric type of relationship that refers to the exploration of one\u2019s own \ncorporal sensations and corresponds to the fact that \u201cindividuals are not satis\ufb01ed with \nconsidering, contemplating, examining, desiring, and admiring objects, but must touch, taste, and feel them in a constant collaboration of the \ufb01ve senses\u201d (L\u00f6fgren, 1996, p. 143).

One interesting example was \nfound by Serge Tisseron (1999), who tells the story of a young man who used to \ngreatly enjoy repairing old sofas. This activity was an extension of what he did as a child to \u201crepair\u201d his parents, whom he always saw as being broken down and used up. Having failed in this task, he tried to do better with sofas. The choice of this particular piece of furniture was symptomatic of his desires, as a sofa is a lap that people can sit on. Moreover, sofas have arms that can hold you, which is more or less the expectation that any child has of parents. As the young man\u2019s therapy sessions progressed, he began to concentrate on renovating the kind of veneer wood that is used to decorate early twentieth-century sofas, discovering how gestures such as sanding, polishing, varnishing, and cleaning the wood\u2019s \u201cskin\u201d could help him to unconsciously work through early experiences in which he had been the object of too much hugging from his parents. This had happened because the young man\u2019s parents used him to give free rein to their own frustrated needs for closeness and contact. Once their son had grown up, \nthey reacted to their own incestuous desires by adopting attitudes of coldness \nand distance that the child found all the more dif\ufb01cult to explain because they would occur after periods of excessive intimacy.

This idea of a kind of initial indistinction is reminiscent of certain studies of emotions and passion. For example, at the origin of an emotion, there is always a meeting. According to Sartre, \u201cthe emotion is a certain way of apprehending the world,\u201d one where \u201cthe subject feeling the emotion and the object of the emotion are united in a synthesis that cannot be dissolved\u201d (Sartre, 1965, p. 37). As indicated by its name, e-motion is not a purely internal state, but more of a movement that brings the subject feel-ing the emotion out of him/herself, with the subject then being able to express him/herself by modifying his/her relationship to the world. Consciousness projects emotional signi\ufb01ca-tions upon the surrounding world and, in return, \u201cvibrates at its most intimate level, \u2018living\u2019 this modi\ufb01cation of the world and providing it with consistency through physical reactions that serve as its \u2018substance\u2019 \u201d(Sartre, 1965, pp. 50\u201351). The being that feels the emotion is overwhelmed both internally and externally. Through its emotional power, an object plays an essential mediator\u2019s role that makes it possible to express some of its user\u2019s character or personality traits via a sort of mechanism based on an incorporation and marginalization of the individual\u2019s psychic life.\nThe emotional power of objects raises question as to where they begin or end. Are \nobjects de\ufb01ned in opposition to \u201cliving substances\u201d or rather by their own functions? Should they be contrasted with humans? Can they occasionally supplement humans or become part of them? Furthermore, the distinction between subject and object is a relatively recent one. Its premises go back to Roman times (notably the distinction between persona/res), even \nthough it has only really developed in what we call modern times. So what is the de\ufb01nitive de\ufb01nition of an object? Etymologically, object ( objectum) means \u201cthrown against,\u201d a thing \nthat exists outside of ourselves, that is placed in front of us, and has a material nature. An object, insofar as it can become non-transformable, impenetrable, offering us smoothness and an indifferent nudity, is \ufb01rst and foremost something that resists.\nY et to understand the emotional power of an object over a subject, we need to hypoth-\nesize the existence of an exchange between subject and object, an idea that the western mindset particularly dislikes. The same does not hold in other traditions that recognize no such chasm. For example, Chinese thinking is based on a participation of both the body and the human mind in the winds that blow through the cosmos. Poetry speci\ufb01cally (Liu, 1975) af\ufb01rms the solidarity of the I (wo) with things (wu), as well as the inseparability between emotions or internal experiences ( ch\u2019ing) and the \u201csetting\u201d or the outside world ( ching). \nSimilarly, in the African tradition, emotion occupies an eminent position not as the expres-sion of personal feelings, but as an openness to the world. For a black African, a work of art expresses confrontation, an embrace of a subject and an object (Senghor, 1977). Esthetic emotion supposedly has traces of this kind of indistinction, or feels nostalgia for it. The differentiation of this state entails an investment in the object that speci\ufb01cally implies an exchange between the inside and the outside worlds, one based on a mediation of the body that feels something. What we mainly remember here is the continuity of the psychic processes that invest, in one and the same movement, the body as well as the objects that surround it.

But if we accept that an object entails an experience, would this not be tantamount to hypothesizing the reciprocity, or more precisely, the reversibility of objects? This would intimate that the consumption experientialization paradigm means that objects and brands constitute fully \ufb02edged actors in consumers\u2019 emotional and daily environments, much as relatives or friends. One signi\ufb01cant analysis here is on the relationship that individuals can have with mobile phones: \u201cwe sometimes touch them delicately as we would a dearly be-loved friend\u201d (Tisseron, 2000, p. 20).\nIndeed, if the relational paradigm is to be something other than purely metaphorical, \nwe must accept some symmetry in the exchange between an individual and an object. The wealth of the relationships we entertain with objects stems from their reversible nature, for example from the fact that an object may only be an object yet, at the same time, it is capable of mutating into a true subject partner. T ake, for example, something that is \u201ctreated like a face, hence \u2018envisaged\u2019 or \u2018given a face,\u2019 and which in turn faces us and looks at us . . .\u201d (Deleuze, 1983, p. 126).

We will say that they are watching me, not because such objects resemble a face, but because they are connected to the abstract machine of face-giving\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988, pp. 214\u2013215). Imbued with curative powers, an object becomes much more than an object. It is this person who remains alive, as long as the being who desired it continues to exist.\nCASE VIGNETTE 6.4: THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC \nOBJECT AS A PARTNER\nThe rise of anthropomorphic products clearly illustrates objects\u2019 ability to be-\ncome partners in our daily lives. One example is Ketchupy, the \ufb01rst anthropo-morphic \ufb02ask, which Amora launched in 1994. This anthropomorphic object helps children to restore meaning to the act of eating by transforming a formerly impersonal and glum bottle of tomato sauce into a little person, a companion with whom a child can create a relationship of complicity. This turns meals into small parties, moments when the child can tell things to an object and talk about him/herself. This practice of anthropomorphizing objects has been extended to include many products such as toothbrushes (Signal\u2019s \u201c JoJo\u201d toothbrush) or cu-linary utensils designed by Guido Venturini, Mattia Di Rosa, or Biaggio Cisotti for Alessi, items that reproduce an object\u2019s creation and operationalization pro-cess, shared by the world of children and by primitive cultures, and based on a transcending of any esthetic, stylistic, and cultural discourses.\n(based on information included in Alessi, \nL \u2019usine \u00e0 r\u00eaves )", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "334c771f-8ddb-451d-aef2-ff6d05dc4f39": {"__data__": {"id_": "334c771f-8ddb-451d-aef2-ff6d05dc4f39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c37490ce-8515-4fa9-87ec-c135b79c53f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "ea684338ee85a9f685ce57854d72105f0de1e757a1962e45fa7f3d8bfcd071d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "86957254-3f76-452c-aad0-3cdcdceb94a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "6d6637ff4a62ea5ecda3366109d0d3576de2acd2f82bbe37dabc519639311b75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8c16f72-ad23-4240-a1ff-4469f31c3688", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "475d20ce159e047c2cf1efffa6643569053bfd87a0152e88c2173c5e44a1145d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE BLANDNESS AND DELIGHTS OF A DAILY OBJECT\n89 nIn short, marketing, even in its experiential avatar, continues to depend on a rhetoric of \neffects that is speci\ufb01c to western culture. The aim is both to make an impact that is overt and \nvoluntarily spectacular, and also to highlight the brand\u2019s distinctive signs, as either a product or a trademark. In other words, experiential marketing still falls very much in line with the esthetic view, such as was de\ufb01ned in the eighteenth century by Baumgartner in Aesthetica:\nThe more a perception includes distinctive signs, the stronger it is. Some obscure perceptions contain a greater number of distinctive signs than some clear perceptions and are stronger than the latter. Those perceptions that contain the greatest number of distinctive signs can be described as poignant. Poignant perceptions are the strongest ones . . . . T erms whose signi\ufb01cation is poignant are emphatic.\n And here we come to the terms empathy and emphasis. When we scrutinize marketing, \nwe realize that it can basically rely on two modes for accessing a subject: the emphatic and \nthe empathetic. The former involves a spectacular and grandiose saturation of the effect by \nrelying on that which is bombastic, extraordinary, etc. The latter involves creating complic-ity with the consumer by playing on the referential and interactional levels of an object\u2019s experience.\nWhat we are suggesting here is that consideration be given to two other registers of \nexperience: pathos, which relates to the emotional register and an object\u2019s ability to play its \nin-between role; and the phatic, corresponding to a contact and reassurance register that is \ntied to a sort of banalization of the object (Domecq, 2004). We need to consider the power that can be carried within the banality and the blandness of a daily object (Figure 6.2).\nBLANDNESS OR AN OBJECT\u2019S CHINESE DESTINY\nWithout a doubt, marketing has chosen spiciness over blandness.

Isn\u2019t the best deviance from the norm for us to remain quiet when everyone around is all up in arms, and to let our silence be heard in the generalized uproar?\nBut even if we could isolate this silence in the general noise, something that would already be quite a challenge and a feat, this does not mean that it would be ascribed any meaning outside of its phatic power.\n(Boutaud, 2004, p. 88)\nT o achieve this, we mobilize an esthetic of blandness (Jullien, 1991) that allows us to imagine other categories conducive of a new vision of objects: the vague, the indistinct, the quiet, the transformative, etc. This prism helps us to realize the extent to which brilliance fades because its underpinnings are at best topical and ephemeral, whereas blandness expresses openness to all potentialities as well as the propensity of things just to exist, even those things that are not yet visible or cannot be distinguished. Blandness engages a logic that tries to \u201cinfuse\u201d meaning instead of exposing it and hanging it out for all to see. This is also a logic that revolves around an object\u2019s underlying ability to express itself through ellipsis and enigma, drawing on the ef\ufb01ciency that an object \ufb01nds in a discrete existence, one in which it does not try to create any major effects \u2013 as if an object is all the more effective when people do not notice it or see it at work, only remarking its effects. Instead of valuing that which is spectacular and lauding effort and risk, Chinese thought is attentive to the realm of the discrete, recommending a sort of ef\ufb01ciency that is non-confrontational and does not force things, a drive that advances seamlessly and without spending itself. Hence, its gray effectiveness, \ufb02owing through the course of daily objects that refuse to stand out. The better these objects perform, the less people notice them.\nMeaning should be \u201cinfused\u201d rather than exposed and hung out for all to see. Blandness \ncorresponds to a particular experience of the world, one based on an internal detachment. In the same way that spiciness binds us, blandness frees us. The former captures us and we are obsessed by it. The latter liberates us from outside pressures, sensations, and arti\ufb01cial intensity. This elegy of blandness, which is a basic characteristic of Chinese thinking, could be understood as an antidote to western culture\u2019s inherent ideology, which is based on an oversemanticization of objects. Considering an object\u2019s blandness also means trying to transcend the saturation of our senses\u2019 effects while overcoming the tyranny of the symbolic \u2013 both of which imprison objects in a register that tends to empty them of their meaning, emotionality, and very probably their effectiveness.\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn What are the limits of the approach that views objects as sign systems?\nn To what extent does experience tie us to objects?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3161, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f49239c8-f100-48df-82eb-7c992597de5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f49239c8-f100-48df-82eb-7c992597de5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e927a64-4e0f-4c2c-96fb-40238cb87522", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "60ced97ba3b270ad94f651feb2af7a7a5260bb707bc14c1f619e3d2ceed58c4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8c16f72-ad23-4240-a1ff-4469f31c3688", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "90", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "1de3d06847a3ffe9abdfdd8c61c4637195a5af88e9d350b678191636d598f975", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53e35902-373a-4956-ab1c-a5aafdbdd343", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eee70079ed2c2ccbe50ec2e05773c6fe2dcdba2d1e6d43b3c0601ace0818cfc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE BLANDNESS AND DELIGHTS OF A DAILY OBJECT\n91 nn Can a routine be contrasted with an object\u2019s emotional power?\nn To what extent can blandness become the basis of a veritable experience for an \nobject?\nn What are the four main registers for a consumption experience with an object?\nREFERENCES\nBoutaud, J.J.

Although \nit is likely to apply to relatively ordinary consumption phenomena, it quite naturally \ufb01nds a vast \ufb01eld of investigation in the arena of leisure as well. This can involve cultural practices or tourism (Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982). When seen in this light, risky practices are particularly attractive to many consumers (particularly young adults), as they are likely to generate a whole range of emotions. Indeed, we believed in the existence of a mythology of modern adventure (Le Breton, 2000), one that, based on an intense commitment, would induce individuals to associate (at least symbolically) with death. We view risky practices as modern ordeals whose vocation is to provide answers to questions about the meaning of life. By turning to external forces and thereby imitating the classical ordeal with its reliance on divine sanction, individuals seek a de\ufb01nitive sanction that will supposedly resolve the ten-sions they feel with their social or cultural environments.

The symbolic aspects \nand \ufb01nalities that the protagonists are pursuing can also help to inject value into the con-sumption experience.\nBy deciding to focus on trekking (in the sense of hiking), the present chapter tries to \nqualify the nature of such a consumption experience and ascertain its meaning for young adults. This will notably involve investigating the role that risk plays when such activities are being practiced. The goal here is to apprehend all facets of the risky consumption ex-perience, from the project\u2019s genesis through participants\u2019 \ufb01nal report of their experience. This analysis will allow us to question consumption experiences\u2019 control rationalities from a managerial point of view.\nTREKKING AND EXPERIENTIAL CONSUMPTION\nThe experiential approach to consumption was for all intents and purposes initiated by Hol-brook and Hirschman (1982), who tried to show how consumption could not be reduced to the utilization value of a product\u2019s supply or function. By championing this approach, they were mostly trying to free consumer behavior studies from analyses that focused solely on decision-making, by creating a space in which consumption could be treated as the fully \ufb02edged activity that it is. Applying this same logic, many other authors then analyzed the nature of a slew of consumption experiences, with practices such as rafting and skydiving turning out to be the most fruitful (Arnould and Price, 1993; Celsi et al., 1993). What these \nanalyses had in common is the importance of the emotions felt during the course of such consumption experiences. Emotions were having a major impact on people\u2019s evaluation of their experiences. Analysis of such consumption situations also revealed the role played by people\u2019s involvement in the consumption experience and, in particular, by their active participation in producing the experience, often within a social or even tribal framework. Furthermore, in these kinds of situations, individuals did not simply \ufb01nd themselves in a state of immersion, something that would have implied passive enjoyment. They also had to develop methods and appropriation logics that could pave the way to a satisfactory con-sumption experience.\nAs a tourist activity, trekking offers a new \ufb01eld of investigation for experiential con-\nsumption. It presents the attribute of being considered a risky practice, much like rafting (Arnould and Price, 1993) or skydiving (Celsi et al., 1993). T rekking as an activity involving \nhiking in the wilderness (mountains, deserts, or near the poles) \ufb01ts into consumption logic such that the experiential value is a priori extremely intense. Under these conditions, what we need to investigate is the nature of this consumption experience, to discover whether it is limited to a phenomenological experience. The point of convergence could be found in an experience\u2019s magical nature and, because of their emotions, people in these circum-stances would relate very differently to one another than they do in daily life (Arnould and Price, 1993). Furthermore, this is an experience mediated by a guide, who imbues it with magical and sacred tones by initiating the relationship to nature and structuring people\u2019s relationships with one another. This enables the participant to experience an inter-nal transformation.

In the same vein, in the study of skydiving, the extraordinary experience is characterized by a dramatic situation that implies different phases (namely a beginning, a middle, and an end). The analysis mobilizes (Celsi et al., 1993) this dramatic model, which \nis considered to be seminal in western imagination. The media have given abundant airplay to this concept, particularly on TV and in \ufb01lms. Without a doubt, this has enhanced its relevance for structuring people\u2019s lives.\nThese various ideas on the nature of the risky consumption experience suggest that, \ndespite the importance of the consumption experience\u2019s phenomenological aspect, this is probably not the only facet being mobilized. By hypothesis, the experience\u2019s dramatic and sacred aspects are likely to have had an effect on individuals\u2019 internal transformations, par-ticularly with young adults (Le Breton, 2000). We will be limiting our investigation to this group, comparing our \ufb01ndings with those obtained using older people. T o appreciate the nature of the trekking experience for young adults, we chose to proceed under the egis of an interpretative type of exploratory approach, speci\ufb01cally by applying analytical induction based on grounded theory. This methodological option is rarely used in marketing and the study of consumer behavior, although it can be especially relevant in a postmodern approach to marketing. T o carry out the study, a personal interview technique was chosen, with lim-ited recourse to guided interviews. Respondents were asked to give an in-depth description of their experiences and their reasons for taking part. They were also asked to report on what they had gone through. The interviews were retranscribed in their entirety, following which a contents analysis was carried out. An initial series of \ufb01fteen interviews was mainly conducted in respondents\u2019 homes. Individuals were recruited in various ways, through as-sociations, online, and also via acquaintances. Interviewees were young people between the ages of 23 and 42 (the median being 26 years). Interviews were conducted in a way that complied with theoretical sampling constraints. This principle led to the conclusion that the diversity of cases used was such that semantic saturation had been achieved, so that the later interviews provided little new incremental information. In line with any inductive approach, the \ufb01rst stage consisted of a microanalysis focusing especially on the stated concepts, but also on the way in which they were being stated. Then came a more formal type of categorical encoding. The \ufb01nal stage was based on axial coding that, by interconnecting the various categories, helped to restore the overall coherence of the phenomenon under study .\nFEARS, RISK, AND DANGERS\nThe heart of the consumption experience\u2019s organization resides in notions of perceived risks and dangers faced.

Even when a journey was suf\ufb01ciently prepared, there remained a great deal of uncertainty that couldn\u2019t be overcome before the departure. Scorpions, des-ert sandstorms, bears in certain regions, rockfalls in mountainous areas and, above all, bad weather all constituted potential sources of anxieties that many mentioned. Most fears re-lated to the group\u2019s human environment, i.e., to other expedition participants. Interviewees mentioned the risk that a group member might not be up to scratch. This category notably included fears about testing relationships with other people. Fears about the human en-vironment also included relations with locals, albeit more infrequently. The fear of being robbed or duped by guides or the local population was also mentioned.\nA \ufb01nal focus was the individual him/herself. Interviewees wondered whether they would \nbe successful at the experience they had embarked upon. In particular, they hoped that they could keep up physically and not fall behind. A second aspect pertained to psychological resistance. Individuals hoped that they could cope with any dif\ufb01culties and be mentally solid enough to resist adversity throughout the expedition. These uncertainties, all of which can cause a feeling of fear, were not independent of one another. Clearly, a relationship exists between \u201coneself \u201d and the natural or social environment. Natural and social environments constitute little more than a framework that is likely to interact with people\u2019s fears in this area. The commonality of all these fears is that they could curtail the expedition, as so many different events might lead to failure. It is therefore unsurprising that people ascribed so much importance to them. A \ufb01nal comment concerns the status of these fears, portrayed both as factors that might have a negative impact on the experience\u2019s outcome yet also as a sort of promise, insofar as they related to challenges that our young adults would have to overcome.\nInterviewees were happy to portray their experiences through a prism of danger \u2013 al-\nthough one should question how much danger they really faced (case vignette 7.1). Even if we cannot deny that this type of activity does contain some risk, in many respects this had been measured and channeled. Individuals who chose to travel with an agency or an association found themselves in a situation where the danger seemed very limited indeed, notably because of the help they received from local guides, who were not only familiar with the terrain and the local weather, but also experienced in handling tourists, i.e., capable of keeping any overly ambitious clients under check. Note also that the trek organizers\u2019 risk control methods received scant approval whenever they became too obvious, as this under-mined the representation of authenticity that is associated with trekking, with participants feeling deprived of the possibility of controlling themselves and the risks they had chosen to take. Supervision, when construed as a set of constraints or obligations, is apt to devalue the quality of an experience. It makes an extraordinary experience ordinary, thus taking away its magic.\nIn short, organization can either seem like a constraint that gets in the way of a com-\npletely ful\ufb01lling consumption experience, or else like a support structure that offers a sem-blance of risk without letting this get out of hand.

First and foremost, it is something remarkable that arises in the individual\u2019s environment. In the framework of a trek, this can be confused with a test how-ever.

In and of itself, the vocation of an event is to create a connection and contribute to social cohesion during the trek.

Moreover, it was often vicariously that participants \nevoked the dangers they had faced during an experience. In practice, this invocation consists of bene\ufb01ting from all of the stories told by those individuals who, in identical circumstances or in the same location, had struggled or had an accident, or else who met other people who had witnessed dramatic situations that could have been fatal. These dramatic situations were never experienced directly. They were always mediated by narratives of dramatic episodes that were transmitted orally, much like myths in traditional societies.\nWithout judging the real dangers that people faced as part of their experiences, there \nis little doubt that narratives made it possible for them to get the most mileage (and value) out of the events encapsulating the danger in the situations in which they had found them-selves.\nTHE CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE AND THE QUEST\nAlthough trekking fans assume, accept, and even seek danger, an experience never involves adversity alone. The participant is on a quest for experience. This can be broken down into several facets.\nThe trek as a break from the ordinary\nT rekking, like other sporting activities of its kind, presents the particularity of being very \nlimited in both time and space. This attribute is not without consequences for the way people approach this phenomenon. By being limited, it features discontinuities that isolate it from daily life, meaning that it can be de\ufb01ned as a fully \ufb02edged episode in one\u2019s life. These discontinuities are particularly meaningful, because the journey is over so quickly, and be-cause it causes a sudden sense of being away from home.\nOne position that respondents commonly adopted was the notion of a break from the \nordinary. In general, the trekking experience marked a discontinuity in the \ufb02ow of people\u2019s daily lives. This was something they sought. Adepts of this practice were quick to recognize that a trek was a consumption experience that would enable them to organize a clear-cut discontinuity in their daily life \ufb02ows, while immersing them in another world. It could be viewed as a response to an altered or trivialized self in one\u2019s daily life.\nThis discontinuity materialized in reference to people\u2019s selves. The outcome of the ex-\nperience lay in the approach that the person took to him/herself, to the individual that s/he had been before the experience. The particular poignancy of this discontinuity allowed people to contextualize the experience by means of the changes they were going through \u2013 modi\ufb01cations mediated through their relationship to the natural environment and to other participants.\nAuthenticity\nThe trekking experience very much falls into the category of a search for authenticity.

The sense of wonderment when \nfaced with new landscapes, the colors of the dawn, etc., all of this constitutes an esthetic experience that interviewees mentioned frequently. Individuals become contemplative when exposed to the riches of nature, easily discovering a state of serenity. Elsewhere, we \ufb01nd the fascination of being dominated by the immensity of natural spaces. People no longer neces-sarily felt that they were in a position to dominate their environment. Unfamiliarity with the natural world (albeit one whose risks and dangers could be controlled) meant they felt that they had to yield to it. They were forced to accept its superiority and the impossibility of being able to exert any sort of control over it. In actual fact, it is precisely because the natural environment contained the risk that the person had agreed to face that the setting became so cherished.\nA person\u2019s relationship to nature is also likely to be appreciated from a fusion perspec-\ntive. Interviewees spoke of an intimate and physical relationship to their natural environ-ment during the trek. They had to stand up for themselves in this environment, with all of its challenges. This act of resistance led to a fusional relationship reminiscent of a \u201c\ufb02ow\u201d experience. In practice, an experience of this sort signi\ufb01es an intense emotional and physi-cal involvement in the activity the individual is practicing. This can lead to perceptions of signi\ufb01cant distortions in time. Thus, as people rose to the challenge, they found themselves in sync with their surroundings and did not notice time passing. It was the interaction between the individual and his/her environment that imbued the experience with meaning. Authenticity lay in nature\u2019s resistance to the person\u2019s action.\nIn general, authenticity means naturality. From a structural perspective, this is tradi-\ntionally opposed to culturality, found primarily in urban living. There is nothing natural about cities. T reks, on the other hand, almost exclusively run in natural settings. Here, the opposition between nature and culture is all-encompassing, opposing daily life to life dur-ing the trek. An authentic experience means leaving civilization and urban density behind \u2013 hence participants\u2019 frequent evocation of their antipathy toward touristy destinations, as they generally do not identify with this type of travel. In any event, this was the image that the study\u2019s interviewees wanted to remember \u2013 although it did not necessarily match the reality of certain destinations.

Respondents fre-\nquently mentioned their wish to be in touch with locals, but this often remained wishful thinking.

In particular, we \ufb01nd questions relating to locals\u2019 material living conditions, with participants wondering about the nature of his/her own daily life. The main question concerned the material wealth of the western world, and it was speci\ufb01cally in terms of this material culture that people would muse upon the meaning of life. The discovery of lo-cals\u2019 relative material deprivation made them wonder whether material goods and comforts brought happiness. Appreciations of such encounters varied, ranging from simple surprise to re\ufb02ectivity to complete upheaval. Cultural discovery could also lead to a certain sense of guilt. Curiously, it is noteworthy that, even though trekkers almost systematically mentioned cultural encounter, the real encounter, which in respondents\u2019 opinions would have consisted of taking the initiative of actually going out to meet locals, was much less frequent. It was enough to be able to say that this was something they could at least potentially do during their trek.\nSelf-renewal: a re\ufb02exive approach\nParticipants all characterized trekking in terms of their own selves, as per the re\ufb02exive mode. \nPeople contextualized themselves in their adventure.

This is \npart of what is called \u201cconcern with oneself \u201d (Foucault, 2001). The modern subject tries to \nrestore his/her own coherence, adopting an approach that resembles a conversion. T oward this end, a re\ufb02exivity effort must be undertaken, allowing the individual to wonder about the meaning of his/her own life. Many consumption experiences offer young adults this pos-sibility by giving them a break from their usual circumstances, allowing them to re\ufb02ect upon their lives and to dream about the future. Self-renewal can also be viewed as the restoration of an authentic self \u2013 mainly when the individual is in a situation in which s/he feels a need to rediscover lost meaning.\nTREKKING AS A WAY OF CREATING SELF-NARRATIVE\nThe analyses above justify our amending the purely phenomenological conception of the consumption experience\u2019s extraordinary nature. We should also consider narrative\u2019s role as a practice whereby participants try to normalize their experiences while stabilizing their self-identities (Escalas and Bettman, 2000).\nExperience and its narrative\nA transversal examination of respondents\u2019 discourse reveals great similarities. Clearly, the \ndestinations differed, and the experiences\u2019 ostensible characteristics varied from one person to another. But fundamentally, from a structural viewpoint, there were few basic variations. The trek was presented as an adventure in which the narrator played the hero. Having had to face up to him/herself or to the elements, there was no choice but to complete the quest and return victorious. There could be failures but, even here, the individual could learn some-thing. The narratives produced by our respondents were also far from being linear, i.e., they did not necessarily or strictly comply with sequential (contract\u2013action\u2013sanction) types of narratives. Under these conditions, the use of an actantial schema is particularly appropriate (Propp, 1970; Greimas, 1986). In fact, events or characters are not as important as narra-tives tend to indicate.

Based on \nthis notion of functions, we can identify (Greimas, 1986) actantial categories, i.e., structural invariants that organize respondents\u2019 productions and imbue them with a narrative quality.\nT o start out, the actantial schema (Figure 7.1) isolates the subject and the object. Here, \nthe subject is the actor, the person engaged in the experience. The consumer is the hero but also the narrator. The object characterizes the experience itself, construed as a quest. This consists of living through an extraordinary experience, i.e., a destination that must enable an encounter both with a natural setting that is authentic and rough, and also with another culture, something that requires adaptation and even domination. A successful experience, or at least one containing lessons for the participant, entails the possibility of creating posi-tive emotions and becoming memorable.\nThe actantial schema then separates the sender from the receiver. The former, being the \nperson on whose behalf the subject is acting, must be considered here as one\u2019s altered self. The alteration is generally a consequence of daily life, which will drag an individual into an acceleration that prevents him/her from pursuing the sort of re\ufb02exivity s/he needs in order to develop an identity. This notion of an altered self also implies the possibility of a self that can become increasingly dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne or delineate. By choosing a distant destination that is very different from home, the person is seeking a break from his/her ordinary exis-tence. Thus, the receiver is one\u2019s renewed self, a \ufb01gure who, as we have seen, can be broken down into two modalities: transformation and restoration.\nThe \ufb01nal actantial categories revolve around helper and opponent. Here, we note the \nexistence of a perfect symmetry, as an event can just as easily be a helper as an opponent. Individuals, through their minds and bodies, \ufb01t into these categories. For example, a good preparation allows the body to cope, whereas physical shortcomings are an obstacle to over-come. Moreover, the protagonist has to contend not only with him/herself but also with the other participants. Group cohesion can be a helper, as can the quality of the organization that the service provider has set up. An organization that is omnipresent can also be viewed as an opponent. Lastly, nature can in turn be viewed as either a catalyst or a hindrance. Good weather will be perceived as a helper, wild and potentially dangerous animals as opponents.\nThe legitimacy of the self-narrative: self-identity\nAt a more fundamental level, questions can be raised about the need for young adults to \nlive through extraordinary experiences that are meant to be structured as narratives. The key issue is concern with oneself (Foucault, 2001), which is basically \u201ca technique of exis-tence.\u201d This particularly strong af\ufb01rmation brings us to the true nature of the consumption experience. Ostensibly, a postmodern approach makes us think that it is precisely because the consumption experience is based on a spatio-temporal break with the ordinary that it can become a form of decentering allowing people to live multiple identities (Firat and Venkatesh, 1995). In practice, with trekking, it is actually the concern with oneself that legitimizes the experience. This is a type of self-identity, i.e., a speci\ufb01c story encapsulated in the subject\u2019s biographic past.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3505, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab2c7f54-62f0-488f-b34c-9529aa872484": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab2c7f54-62f0-488f-b34c-9529aa872484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "058d48c8-34c2-4fa0-bd4d-49a97c720afd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "d0df00e75e3193ab73d0b8563089abb715a9599e394705446d222373337065a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd35f9bc-2102-4d18-aca9-7fbebda327b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "2d022933a903ec41e5cd285e56c83ef9393b042f8f1a93c16229a92643dac643", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b3b8ef3-3ed3-4a40-a210-93dca87b1b06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f36ba46793ee8ee707f3f882813b125af4b139741597ce28e8b591ca91baed9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE, SELF-NARRATIVE, AND SELF-IDENTITY\n105 nAs a narrative, this cognitive organization of an experience allows young adults to en-\ntertain a dynamic relationship with themselves. They can think and conceive of themselves \nin action, and as people who are ef\ufb01cient when faced with adversity (Escalas and Bettman, 2000). Primitively, they can offer themselves a self-image that is idealized in its aptitude for self-renewal. Y et this primitive function appears insuf\ufb01cient. It is likely that the individuals involved all feel the need to be able to tell their own story to peers with whom the passion is shared, but also to an exogenous group (composed of those who do not or cannot practice this type of activity) so as to signify what it is that makes them so singular \u2013 and ultimately so they can set their story in the context de\ufb01ned by their own personal pasts. Here, we \ufb01nd the desire or need to have a story to tell in the future, to one\u2019s children for example. As such, experience is fundamentally anchored in discourse. This imbues experience with a durability that the simple remembrance of the emotions that one felt cannot reproduce. Memories of emotions are far too personal to be readily communicated. As such, self-narrative de-rived from an extraordinary experience of this type is the means by which young adults can structure their identities (Shankar et al., 2001; Bruner, 2002) and turn their existences into \nsomething coherent. Such narratives do not have to be a true re\ufb02ection of reality (remember the possible exaggeration of danger).\nSelf-narrative is the culmination of the de\ufb01nitive incorporation of the experience into \nthe individual\u2019s identity \u2013 something called the \u201cnarrative identity\u201d (Ricoeur, 1990). At the same time, it offers the possibility of a social diffusion of the experience, in a normalized and recurrent framework, irrespective of the surrounding cultures \u2013 namely the narrative (Shankar et al., 2001).\nIDENTITY CONSUMPTION AND CONTROL OF A \nCONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE\nNarrative discusses reality \u201cin the subjunctive tense . . . \ufb01nding room for what actually ex-\nists, but also to what could happen or could have happened. This subjunctivized universe is particularly exciting, even if it has every chance of not being very comfortable\u201d (Bruner, 2002, p.47). T o a certain extent, this conception of the narrative summarizes the legitimacy thereof as a way of organizing a memorable experience and structuring an individual\u2019s iden-tity. It is probably for this reason that this self-narrative process speci\ufb01cally affects young adults, who feel the need both to project themselves into the future and also to conjugate their life in the future perfect tense, something that is no longer necessary for full-blown adults, who have already moved well along their life trajectory. For the latter, the trekking experience is purely phenomenological. The narratives that our respondents gave us may not have started out with \u201conce upon a time\u201d \u2013 but, from a structural perspective, most produc-tions by the young adults we questioned were based on the same actantial schema model. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that a narrative is a way of injecting coherency into the consumption experience by placing the actor at the center of the system. This coherency drive is a true legitimization mechanism for individuals, insofar as it helps them to singularize themselves (Bruner, 2002).

Indeed, an experience is never truly complete as long as it has not been ex-\npressed or communicated to someone else (T urner, 1982).\nThe \ufb01ndings of our study enrich certain aspects of experiential marketing. From a \nmanagerial perspective, it appears that, for young adults, the implementation of a normative framework is not an entirely satisfactory way of producing an experience, as this makes it hard to control the consumption experience. We agree that experiential marketing owes it to itself to integrate sensorial, emotional, and relational considerations with cognitive expe-riences and actions. What remains open, however, is how this should be done. T o enhance operationalization, three major means (Filser, 2002) have been proposed to provide valuable experiences, namely decor, intrigue, and action. Decor means the stage that has been set for the consumption situation. In the case of extreme tourism, management means identifying exotic destinations and natural decors, and offering varying levels of dif\ufb01culty as well as adapted logistics. Intrigue (a.k.a. the narrative) refers here to the brand, and to the epic events that have marked the brand\u2019s history and, in general, its communications. Brands such as T erre d\u2019Aventure and Makalu Adventure (case vignette 7.3) are perfect illustrations of this type of strong discourse in a trekking framework. Lastly, action consists of getting the consumer to entertain a relationship with the product or service offer, for example within the framework of a brand community.\nCASE VIGNETTE 7.3: MAKALU ADVENTURE\nMakalu Adventure is an endeavor to promote Nepal to the outside world \nwhile striving to protect an age-old tradition as well as preserve the environ-ment for generations to come. We have committed ourselves to take every step necessary to cater you an experience you will fondly look back upon not caring what it cost you, as you will be returning back a richer person full of memories.

Our \ufb01nd-\nings suggest that excessive controls, or controls that severely restrict consumers\u2019 degree of freedom, constitute negative factors in people\u2019s valuations of their consumption experience. Operators in the market that can still be called extreme tourism are the parties implementing these controls, which remain necessary for obvious safety reasons. What remains for them is the possibility of staging the dangers faced, although this does run the risk of offending trekking fans\u2019 desire for authenticity. What operators can do to give consumers suf\ufb01cient freedom is set up experience co-production systems instead of production situations per se. This would allow for an in situ adaptation of an experience to its participants\u2019 speci\ufb01cities, \nfacilitating their self-narrative or else offering narratives that will then help each of them to situate the experience within their own biographical frameworks. Group guides or organiz-ers will have a central role to play toward this end, and their performances will constitute an original form of stage setting. Over the course of the experience, they will have to mobilize adversity\u2019s imaginary aspects, as well as a certain number of epic episodes that the partici-pants will have to overcome. This co-production can also impact on consumers\u2019 relation-ships to the product or service offering. Examples include Internet community development systems that are dedicated to the reconstitution of experiences; to facilitating the expression of travel narratives; or to mobilizing consumers\u2019 interests in managed events and in testi-monial opportunities, which can in turn lead to self-narrative. It is, in any event, dif\ufb01cult to standardize one\u2019s control over an experience. This requires a great deal of effort at the qualitative level, particularly with respect to relations between the service providers\u2019 on-site representatives and the customer.

Although this means that any product or service may convey a hedonic experi-ence, it is widely agreed that those of the creative industries (given the strong emotional involvement that they are able to arouse) best \ufb01t the features described in the de\ufb01nition.\nWhat drives consumers toward hedonic products and services is the search for a hedonic \nresponse, i.e., a combined response from the emotions, senses, imagination, and intellect (Lacher and Mizerski, 1994). Consumers expect those categories of products and services KEY POINTS\nn A hedonic consumption experience is a specific kind of consumption \nexperience.\nn A hedonic experience arouses emotional, sensorial, imaginal, and cognitive \nconsumer\u2019s responses.\nn Live performances are peculiar hedonic experiences because of audience \nparticipation and artist\u2013audience interaction.\nn Every performance can be considered as a system of signs that can arouse \nemotions, sensations, imagination, and perceptions in different ways.\nn In a rock concert, the system of signs combines purely technical aspects of \nthe performance with the role of the artists and the atmosphere.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2131, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5e9b27a-435f-41d1-afc3-61f4e3502e49": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5e9b27a-435f-41d1-afc3-61f4e3502e49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57222c9e-651b-4e63-b4f6-1ec079ac1610", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "33bf7cb7c2c6edac3638421e26de0ec94e67254979e5d31dbf0cae1a0f99e55b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc2283d0-5aa2-40b8-ad49-6effd190204d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "c0c3fd0964266903097e44b36b853eb20ee1a137e16785cc23f788f33b39e2dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb23fcdc-a243-483a-acd5-f6dd793ee791", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a45aad1a709e7980006b0ea1568d2c7ec6e4beb75139c47a5dee88c65aca5d0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SANTORO AND TROILO\nn 110to create an absorbing experience (Swanson, 1978), arousing their emotions, stimulating \na physical reaction, soliciting their memories and fantasies, and triggering their cognitive development. The concept of absorbing experience, which derives from sociology, is very close to the concept of \ufb02ow experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997) developed in psychology. The immersion in a certain context is the access to the consumption experience: even for artistic products, the understanding of the different elements composing a certain context can help in creating different experience.\nIn this chapter, we focus on one hedonic product, rock music, and, more speci\ufb01cally, on \none of the ways it can be experienced: a concert. As for recorded music, previous studies have shown that four features \u2013 tempo, rhythm, dynamics, and phrasing \u2013 affect consumer experience (Holbrook and Bertges, 1981). When we look at live performances, other fea-tures come into play and can facilitate the immersion in a certain event. The artist(s), the venue, the behavior of other concert-goers may all play a fundamental role in creating an absorbing experience.\nOf course, rock concerts have a fairly standard connotation in the eyes of concert-goers. \nHowever, beyond the technical aspects of the performance (play list, musical arrangements, etc. \u2013 all components of content), a rock concert can be the source of completely different experiences for each consumer, depending on the contribution provided by the context of such an event. This has prompted us to look at the role of artists and their interaction with the public, as well as at the atmosphere of a rock concert.\nA good way to explore the capacity of a rock concert to create an absorbing experi-\nence \u2013 or a \ufb02ow experience \u2013 is to consider the performance as a system of signs to be deconstructed and reconstructed, and show the various ways in which these signs can be assembled. The outcome of different combinations of signs is a completely new experience, even though the musical genre is unchanged. Consequently, the methodological background we use in this study is semiotics, which has made a widely recognized contribution to the analysis of consumer behavior (e.g., Mick, 1986).\nThe essay is structured as follows. First, we present an interpretative model of a rock \nconcert based on a semiotic approach. Subsequently, we analyze an especially interesting case: the Italian rocker Ligabue, who, on his 2003 Italian tour, used two completely different concert formats, so combining the denotative and connotative signs of his performance in very different ways.\nA CONCERT AS A SYSTEM OF SIGNS\nAs is true of all cultural phenomena, a rock concert can be seen as an event made up of a speci\ufb01c sign system produced by a transmitter (concert organizers and artists) and decodi-\ufb01ed by a receiver (the audience). In the traditional de\ufb01nition, a sign is a fundamental unit that is used to represent something else, i.e., a relationship that links a signi\ufb01er to the signi-\ufb01ed (Eco, 1975).\nIn order for there to be a \u201csign relationship,\u201d someone has to be able to make the con-\nnection between signi\ufb01er and signi\ufb01ed. So, the sign is not a thing, but a social and cultural relationship.

This physical presence is beyond normality and places the audience in a dimension totally separate and apart from daily life. Therefore, a concert is a planned event involving the physical presence of artists and their contact with the public.\nThe signi\ufb01cance of this presence might seem trivial, something to be taken for granted, \nyet it actually forms the basis for the system of interaction between artists and their public. T o understand this role more fully, we can refer to the useful concept of \u201caura,\u201d which Benjamin (1936) de\ufb01nes as the \u201cunique appearance or semblance of distance.\u201d For a given event, three aspects of the word \u201caura\u201d are relevant: the object or auratic product is unique (and unrepeatable); the situation in which it occurs is unique (not only the auratic object, but also its appearance are unique); and, lastly, the auratic object resides in a context beyond daily experience. Clearly, a concert meets these three requirements. It is a unique event that occurs in a context beyond everyday life and, as such, is a once-only, planned appearance of what is normally \u201cdistant\u201d from the observer.\nThe presence of the artist is, then, the principal auratic element of a concert. Artists \n\u201cappear\u201d to the audience during the event, momentarily (and unrepeatably) reducing the physical, cognitive, and emotional distance between themselves and the public.\nDuring the concert, the artists\u2019 aura is expressed through their body language.The \ufb01rst component of this sign system is the physical position taken up by the leader \nwith respect to the others. It is the leader who emanates the strongest aura during the event, so he/she takes the most visible position, with respect to both the public and the other musi-cians. Consequently, the leader is always in a central position (this is true for both soloists and group singers) and tends to stand upstage nearer to the public.\nThe leadership position is also reinforced by a system of behaviors, in particular the \norder in which the musicians make their entrance. Only after all the other members of the group have taken the stage does the leader come on and the concert actually begins.\nThe second component of the sign system of body language is gestures, a set of factors \nthat determine the degree of interaction with the public. First of all, gestural interaction occurs if the public has the opportunity to play an active part in the show. This opportunity (which can be more or less explicit) mainly depends on the atmosphere and the formality of the location. Artists can inspire audience participation by dialogue, verbal encouragement, and, most importantly, gesticulation. The effectiveness of gestures and body language is es-sentially based on the leadership of the artist. The more the public recognizes this leader-ship, the more the gestural expression turns into a process of emulation between the artist and the audience. Concert-goers tend to copy what artists do, especially when encouraged to do so.

Naturally, people are freer to \nexpress themselves physically if they are on their feet. Dancing, moving around, applauding, and cheering on their idol are expressions of the sign system of the body language within a concert context.\nAtmosphere\nAtmosphere serves primarily to bring out the artists\u2019 aura in the eyes of concert-goers and, \nideally, to reinforce this aura in their minds. A pop performance today is seen as a \u201crite in which not the music, not the song, but the performer is the centre of attention\u201d (Sibilla, 2003, p. 164). The current concept of performance originated in the 1950s when Elvis Presley made his debut. He sparked a radical change in the history of live music, as his body became an integral part of the performance, and the staging of music began.\nFrom Elvis on, the body became a primary sign of aura within the concert context, tak-\ning on a role similar to that of a sovereign (signi\ufb01cantly, Elvis was known as The King) who possesses an aura of power and was a cult \ufb01gure in absolutist European courts (Boni, 2002). Consequently, the value of body language materializes explicitly through the public\u2019s search for proximity. The chance to see artists up close or even to touch them has experiential value in and of itself. It is no coincidence, for example, that contests often offer as prizes the chance to spend time with a pop idol. Similarly, the value of an autograph resides in the proof of physical contact between a fan and an artist.\nA series of components makes up the sign system of artists\u2019 body language at a concert. \nKey elements are the stage and the use of lighting.\nThe stage features that contribute to the semiosis of a rock concert include:\nn size compared with the space reserved for the audience; the public\u2019s average viewing \ndistance and their angle of vision also depend on this factor;\nn shape, which is essential in accentuating the central role of the leader and allowing \nhim/her to get close to the public;\nn materials used and their visual (light is absorbed differently by shiny or opaque surfaces), \nacoustic (the same is true of sound), and tactile (wood, velvet, and fabric tend to create a feeling of warmth, while metal and glass have the opposite effect) impacts;\nn colors, which can be cool or warm, making the atmosphere more formal or more \n\u201cfriendly;\u201d\nn staging and theming: various props can be placed on the stage to create a speci\ufb01c \n\u201creference reality.\u201d A theme can tie into the kind of music being performed, the musicians\u2019 preference or how the album will be promoted.

Aspects of the physical \nenvironment that impact the artist\u2013audience relationship during the concert are: the aver-age viewing distance between the artist and the public, i.e., the visual path of an observer looking at the stage from the middle of the audience; the angle of the line of vision, i.e., how far above or below the stage the observer is positioned. The further away and the higher up the artist is with respect to the audience, the more the public will perceive the artist\u2019s inaccessibility and superiority. On the other hand, a shorter average viewing distance and less inclination of the observer\u2019s line of vision represent a more equal relationship between artist and audience and greater accessibility.\nConcert location, therefore, has a major impact on these factors. A stage set very high up \nand far away from the audience will have a different effect than a low stage that is close to the public. Sometimes, the shape of the stage is revamped to allow the leader to be closer to the audience, meaning that the average viewing distance is reduced.\nIn addition to the stage, the second element that enhances the sign system of body \nlanguage is the lighting.\nThe lighting serves a number of different functions within a concert context: a basic \nfunction of optimizing the audience\u2019s view of the stage; an orientative function of directing the observer\u2019s line of vision during the course of action; a choreographic function, comple-menting the music and creating rhythm; a symbolic function, \u201crepresenting the aura,\u201d spot-lighting the key onstage element in each part of the concert (the leader, a musician during a solo, etc.).\nT o understand how lighting can be used within the system of signs in a rock concert, the \nfollowing factors are relevant:\nn Focus: lighting can be focused on the artist, on the stage, on the surrounding area, or \non the audience. The audience\u2019s attention is drawn to wherever the lighting is focused. \nLighting trained directly on the audience tends to prompt participation and enhance the effects of the gestures and interaction described above, whereas mainly spotlighting the artists emphasizes the \u201cauratic aspect.\u201d\nn Number of lights: this can vary and affects the overall intensity of the concert lighting.\nn Dynamics: light can be \ufb01xed or mobile, creating movement and rhythm.\nn Direction: the lighting may be centripetal, focused on the stage, or centrifugal, directed \noutward; vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lighting can also add to the dramatic visual effect and the rhythm.\nn Colors, which can be warm (yellow, red, orange), cool (purple, blue, light blue), and \nneutral (white), can in\ufb02uence the audience\u2019s mood in different ways.\nn Rhythm; the tempo of the lighting, i.e., the movement of the lights and how they \nchange color, direction, and intensity, may be fast, slow, or absent, so enhancing or modifying the rhythm of the music.\nHow lighting affects concert-goers depends on the speci\ufb01c mix of the above characteris-\ntics.

Both were exactly the same length, with the same number of songs, but with two different formats, i.e., two different sign systems. This gave his fans the chance to enjoy two completely different experiences. In addition to the traditional active, electric show, Ligabue added a format he had never used before \u2013 an acoustic-type (\u201cunplugged\u201d), friendly meeting concert held in a theater. As a result, the artist had the opportunity to ap-peal to a new audience not normally attracted to an active show.\nThe Ligabue case study was carried out using a combination of methodologies: a semiotic \ndesk analysis of the two formats, participant observation at the two versions of the concert, and analysis of the debate on the two formats among the Ligabue fans on the of\ufb01cial fan club website. Our intention was to determine whether the two sign systems were recognized and what kind of experiences emerged.\nLigabue\u2019s \ufb01rst album was released in 1990 and met with enormous success and sales of \nhalf a million copies. The Neverending T our (around 300 dates) ran from 1990 to 1993 with the debut band, Clandestino. However, the \ufb01rst stage of the artist\u2019s career ended when he split with this band.\nLigabue and his new group (with almost the same line-up as today) debuted with Buon \nCompleanno Elvis! in 1995, an album that sold a million copies and won the artist several awards. After the tour following the release of this album, a compilation of live perfor-mances was produced that sold 800,000 copies. In 1997, a six-concert tour was organized in large public spaces (typically stadiums), which was conceived as a moment of celebration for the artist.\nAfter more than a decade, Ligabue\u2019s career has reached the stage of maturity. Recording \nprojects now alternate with movie productions. In 1998, Ligabue directed a \ufb01lm based on a book he himself had written. He also wrote and recorded the \ufb01lm soundtrack (300,000 copies sold). The artist\u2019s second \ufb01lm came out in 2001. All Ligabue\u2019s albums have sold at least 500,000 copies, which undoubtedly makes him one of the best-loved rockers in Italy .\nThe tour described below ran from November 2002 to April 2003, enjoying resounding \nsuccess and widespread audience participation.\nThe acoustic concert\nAs this format (Figure 8.3) was completely new to the artist, the \ufb01rst contribution to se-\nmiosis came in the period leading up to the performances during the communication cam-paign.\nThe signs used in this phase can be identi\ufb01ed in the advertising material distributed in \nthe places where concerts were held.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2991, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20701fa5-c1b7-4d94-9574-95a71f18040a": {"__data__": {"id_": "20701fa5-c1b7-4d94-9574-95a71f18040a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a40baede-e4ea-4db4-b9a5-32e7de431ba5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "22b03b2b8c8850541a5e87e9098dffa8e5db5bc73da012f01453df639a57a6ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a551ee92-71f0-4d2b-b7c1-b1b65a8e459f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "515d7e538a5c32927d693f978b0b1aae78df7a36304d94663e6013f56a4ab30d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "787eeeaa-cd21-45ae-b103-54ce76c21707", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89bbea4fc815f4d39882dc8708d21b294551419732557d2d1fb5b01f3c058a4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "THE DRIVERS OF HEDONIC CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE\n117 nOn the poster which advertises the acoustic concert, the name of the artist is immedi-\nately linked with the speci\ufb01cation \u201cat the theater\u201d (in teatro). The members of the band and \nthe instruments they play are listed in the center of the poster. This is done to underscore the technical aspect of the concert. It is also interesting to note that the key feature of the picture is the light, cutting diagonally across the scene and focusing on Ligabue, the leader, who is center-stage with respect to the band. The light ties the artist into the surrounding setting, shortening the distance between him and the public. The audience is shown ap-plauding at the end of the concert. The shot is laid out with the theater itself and the public occupying most of the space. This strongly emphasizes the location, which is an essential part of the event. The audience, gathered around the stage, shows warm appreciation of the artist, and this is further emphasized by the use of warm colors.\nThe key messages in the communication campaign are therefore: the novelty of the proj-\nect; the innovative technical aspect of the concert and how this related to artistic needs (fur-ther underscored by part of the text of the poster dedicated to the band); the importance of location, highlighted by the spatial layout of the photograph; interaction with the audience, accentuated by lighting, which shortens the distance in the photo and the semi-circular shape of the theater; the feeling of success the image conveys, which reduces the risk that may be perceived by potential concert-goers in view of the novel project.\nIn terms of the positioning of the musicians and the audience, the concert held in the \nMazdaPalace in Milan was a very revealing example.

The original materials were covered to leave room for wood, velvet, and the fabric of the theater curtain and backdrop. Otherwise, there were wicker chairs and rugs, which can be considered stage furnishings. In fact, there was no staging or theming whatsoever at the acoustic concert. The furnishings, materials, and colors evoked a home-like setting, similar to a living room. T o some extent, this ties into the very meaning of the theater within the community. The theater is actually an expanded version of the aristocratic sitting room and served the same purpose in social terms. In this case, however, the \u201cliving room\u201d where the concert was held was not an elitist setting.

The structure of the lighting \nsystem was very complex (case vignette 8.2), with a large number of lights positioned along the entire perimeter and above the stage, as well as in the surrounding area. In this way, the entire stage area was lit up, capturing the public\u2019s attention.

Second, body language was used as an explicit invitation to the public to partici-\npate in the show.

This \u201cfollow my lead\u201d established a continuous dialogue between the band and the public. The sign system used by the band to encourage participation was based totally on action. The audience was invited to jump, clap, cheer, and applaud. In turn, the fans expressed their enjoyment not only by applause, but also through body language, i.e., jumping, pointing to the stage, singing, and improvised dancing.\nBeyond this type of audience involvement, interaction among members of the public \nwas also very apparent, thanks to the strong collective \ufb02avor of the event. Obviously, concert organizers had little control over this aspect, but it was nonetheless fundamental. Before the concert began, the big screen was used to spotlight this audience interaction, and shots of the fans showed their collective spirit and elicited their enthusiasm.\nCONCLUSION\nThis case study has brought to light the effect on consumer experience of different semiotic processes at a rock concert. Analysis of the debates on the Ligabue fan club website con\ufb01rms that the two types of concerts were experienced in completely different ways.\nThe \u201cfriendly meeting\u201d theater concert featured a warm, intimate setting with a minimal \naverage viewing distance and negative visual inclination. The consumer setting was relaxed, with natural lighting. Both the public and the musicians were seated, and interaction was mostly verbal and informal.\nIn contrast, the electric \u201cactive show\u201d had a more dramatic atmosphere, on account \nof the sensorial overstimulation created by the lighting and special effects. There was a great deal of audience participation in the form of gestures and body language and, again, there was no sense of formality. Generally, the distance between the public and the artist was greater in the sports arena than in the theater (in part as a result of the positive visual inclination), but was never too great.\nThe study reveals that the primary experience of the acoustic concert was a high level \nof involvement regarding the novelty of the project. Second, the audience paid careful at-tention to the technical aspects of the music. Most comments made reference to the ar-rangements and the talent of the musicians. Listening enjoyment was clearly enhanced by the atmosphere, which gave rise to a feeling of calmness and intimacy. Assigned seating contributed signi\ufb01cantly to these emotions.\nThe electric concert experience proved to be almost the exact opposite. This event, \nwhich featured a number of elements that excited the public, tended to offer a standard consumer experience in terms of the technical aspects of the music. What mattered most to the audience was the physicality and the presence of the artist. Consequently, the kind of emotions described by this group of concert-goers essentially centered on excitement, fun, and energy.\nThe case study con\ufb01rms and extends the \ufb01ndings of previous research on hedonic", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3239, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a54f82df-a246-4725-aae8-0012f36aff85": {"__data__": {"id_": "a54f82df-a246-4725-aae8-0012f36aff85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4062cf6-7828-4acd-9adc-b66f09e01c49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "613b569da70e4ecdb5d306cdada910090ae602968961f473c883143911e06c84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94a884b8-ab8d-4778-9d49-5e4f6eb67cb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "9d096c04e2b9f6d74fb8c2acff27e9cc9e1c219ebbe68711825bff133a22326e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "614c81ed-2487-4cc5-b96c-e929840f6798", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1900e4b42a62ba368b314bbe23d0e46d306d131697fdb8d06850394c9773f036", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SANTORO AND TROILO\nn 124consumption in general and musical consumption in particular. As for the many different \nhedonic experiences analyzed in previous research (e.g., Arnould and Price, 1993; Celsi et al., 1993), the experience of a rock concert is also based on responses from the senses, emotions, and imagination. Moreover, our study shows that the combination of several signs helps to shape consumer experience in different ways. The aura of the artist, the artist\u2013audi-ence interaction, and the atmosphere all play a fundamental role in facilitating the immer-sion of the customer in the context and in creating absorbing experiences.\nThe four types of rock concert described above show that varied context can be designed \nto arouse different experiences, i.e., different emotional, sensorial, and imaginal responses. While the friendly meeting and the pure listening concerts call for calmer emotions, the ac-tive and passive shows are more exuberant. Moreover, the activities during the various types of concert also shape the consumer response in different ways. While the friendly meeting and the active show solicit a warm atmosphere and good interaction with the audience, the pure listening and the passive show are constructed on a greater distance between artists and the public, so reducing the level of interaction. However, depending on consumer expecta-tions, the level of satisfaction with the concert can, nevertheless, be extremely high.\nIn conclusion, rock concerts and the formats for live performances can be built in vari-\nous ways (all technical aspects being equal) using differing semiotic processes based on the particular roles of the artists and the atmosphere, and resulting in extremely diverse hedonic consumption experiences.\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn What are the components of a hedonic consumption experience?\nn Why are products and services with a significant creative content more capable of \nfacilitating immersion and of creating an absorbing \u2013 or flow \u2013 experience?\nn What are the principal components of the system of signs at a live performance in \ngeneral?\nn What impact do they have on the consumer experience?\nn What types of rock concerts can be constructed using different systems of signs?\nNOTE\n1 The authors are grateful to Jarno Iotti for the pictures in this chapter.\nREFERENCES\nArnould, E.J. and Price, L.L.

Finally, we show how experiential marketing provides an opportunity to renew the meaning of the brand\u2013consumer relationship.\nTHE ISSEY MIYAKE BRAND: THE A-POC CONCEPT\nBorn in Hiroshima in 1935, Issey Miyake studied graphic design before beginning his career working for haute couture houses such as Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy in Paris. His \ufb01nal apprenticeship was with Geoffrey Been in New York. In 1970, Miyake decided to return to Japan to create the Miyake design studio. Even though many of his designs clearly bore traces of the silhouettes and materials found in traditional Japanese clothing, Issey Miyake\u2019s idea was to create a whole new style that would be both multi- and metacultural in nature. He has tried throughout his career to attain \u201ccreative truths.\u201d In fact, this is what Miyake\u2019s customers love about his work. The man is a true intellectual and has worked hard to develop new foundations underpinning the way consumers relate to his brand.\nIssey Miyake is probably best known for his \u201cPleats Please\u201d brand, a line of clothing he \nlaunched in 1990. The wardrobes of some of Miyake\u2019s biggest female fans are generally \ufb01lled with products from this speci\ufb01c house brand, which they are very proud to wear as they usually have a guaranteed effect: everyone in their entourage will comment upon their very unique dress sense and make highly sympathetic and admiring remarks about how original it is. What this shows is that Miyake\u2019s brand played a major role in helping his female consumers to develop their sense of identity. T o top it off, true connoisseurs are usually the only people capable of appreciating how expensive and unique these items are. Everyone knows that Chanel or Gucci costs an arm and a leg, but things are much more subtle with Miyake\u2019s collections, which relate to materials and forms in a highly idiosyncratic manner. Light effects still constitute an integral part of Miyake\u2019s work.\nThe \u201cPleats Please\u201d collection is both elegant and relaxed, which is exactly what people \nwho buy Miyake products seek. In some cases, where greater attention has been paid to an item\u2019s geometric shape, the ensuing form features a sort of organic complexity. Clearly, Miyake has been developing products for cultured people with a highly developed sense of fashion and esthetics. His products are not easily and immediately accessible. They convey a very speci\ufb01c semiological content. Issey Miyake\u2019s new \u201c A-POC\u201d (A Piece of Cloth) brand was an attempt to transform buyers into fashion designers. This very original collection is based on a simple principle: the different items of clothing are woven so that they can be cut without the fabric fraying.\nDuring the autumn/winter 1999 shows, Miyake presented the principles underlying his \nnew collection in public. Standing on the catwalk with a model dressed from head to toe in \u201c A-POC,\u201d he took a pair of scissors and hypnotized the audience by showing how a sil-houette can be entirely transformed with these products to make it into something unique.

A few weeks later (in February \n2000), Issey Miyake opened his \ufb01rst \u201c A-POC\u201d store in T okyo, followed by a second one in Paris in September of that year. The Paris boutique was located in the city\u2019s Marais district, a choice translating the designer\u2019s explicit desire to attract a progressive, intellectual clientele, one capable of properly appreciating work that clearly broke with the traditional Carr\u00e9 d\u2019Or top fashion houses\u2019 more conservative values system. The A-POC outlet was perched on a street corner in the heart of a pedestrian neighborhood. When entering the boutique, the \ufb01rst thing one noticed would be the sharp contrast between the intense white light inside and the darker colors outside. The street-side storefront had windows painted in a milky white that made it impossible to see what was going on inside. This reinforced the sense of privacy, isolating the \u201chappy few\u201d insiders (Miyake\u2019s tribe) from any outsiders.\nThe inaugural evening found the boutique full of fans who were real brand connoisseurs \nand generally very much liked belonging to a small inner circle that had its own speci\ufb01c code of esthetics and rituals of \u201cadoration\u201d for this designer. Some clients knew everything about Issey Miyake and his life, collections, and philosophy. The event would be an excellent opportunity to get close to him and experience something unique. Issey Miyake stood in the middle of the boutique, introducing guests to the Bouroullec brothers, who had been the premises\u2019 architects and were considered to be highly creative and very trendy members of their profession. Ronan Bouroullec spoke a few words:\nHere we have tried to use the A-POC concept to re-create the atmosphere of a place where people can work and create things. In other words, as per Issey Miyake\u2019s wishes, we have tried to build a tailor\u2019s workshop with a \ufb02uid atmosphere. After all, the A-POC concept owes it to itself to evolve constantly. The store\u2019s operational codes should help to position it within a greater transformational movement.\nIssey Miyake then added:\nMy dear friends! All you need is a pair of scissors. With this new brand, I wanted to create a new link, a new kind of relationship between you and my creative output. When imagining this new collection, I was thinking about the kind of relationship we have. Who is really the designer here? You or me? We now know that the answer is you AND me. I have tried to embody the fact that we are all designers and wearers of fashion, both at the same time. I hope that this collection will help to bring my work off its pedestal whilst imbuing it with new meaning. What we have here is a deconstruction process that should be able to translate into a new reconstruction. Instead of having a one-way street, I very much wanted to get you more involved so that you can reap-propriate my clothes, including creatively. By using scissors as we did, we have launched a co-design process. This will also help me to learn from you and I hope to have a chance to see my clothes worn in many different forms that I myself might never have imagined.

In any event, experiential marketing has accentuated a new vision of how \ncompanies view their customers. The latter are no longer purely thought of as existing at \u201cthe end of the chain\u201d but as fully \ufb02edged actors with whom the company will try to develop a relationship in which both parties act as the \u201cco-builders\u201d of what is going to occur.\nLiterature on this brand\u2013consumer connection has grown greatly in recent years (Heil-\nbrunn, 1995; Fournier, 1998). From our perspective, this involves a steady slide toward an experiential paradigm as what we have here is a formalization of the relational modalities between two entities (the brand and the consumer). In a certain number of cases, this relationship is to be assimilated with the kind of connection that can exist between two \u201cbeings,\u201d insofar as it can become a veritable passion. Some consumers are no longer able to cope without their favorite brands. Of course, these brand\u2013consumer connections should not mask another reality, which is the possibility for consumers to live through experiential realities where one of the main elements is precisely embeddedness in a community, i.e., an instance where consumption and brands constitute forms of interaction with other actors. Thus, in a certain number of cases, the marketer can replace the individual with another reference, such as the group or tribe (Cova and Remy, 2001).\nCONNECTION CREATION THEMES IN EXPERIENTIAL \nMARKETING\nSome theoreticians in the hotly debated arena of marketing theory have asked whether it is \nthe company or the consumer that has a greater need of this fuller relationship, concluding that preoccupations of this sort are often more managerial than consumerist in nature. The following section starts out with the implicit hypothesis that creating a connection should be of greater importance to us (hence to the marketer as well), more because this could indicate the existence of an interactive process linking companies and consumers, and less because it constitutes a simple outcome. What mainly guides us here are levers capable of achieving a certain level of relational intensity between the two stakeholders (the consumer and the company). We can identify six major themes pertaining to this connection, or to its forms of creation: complicity; customized contacts; ethics; the search for an identity; the presence of something spectacular; and proximity. We will not be speci\ufb01cally elaborating on all of these themes here, although a few examples will be given to explain the speci\ufb01c direc-tions that such practices can take in the \ufb01eld of experiential marketing.\nComplicity is often used as a way of \u201cgetting close\u201d to the consumer. One illustration \nis Elle, the women\u2019s magazine. T o \u201cget close\u201d to their women readers, the company\u2019s man-\nagement pursued an enunciative strategy whereby readers steadily became the magazine\u2019s \u201ceditorial team,\u201d expressing themselves in their letters to the editor. Over the years, Elle\u2019s \nreadership became its point of focus, with the real editors sometimes even agreeing to \u201cplay second \ufb01ddle\u201d to their customers.\nCustomized contacts help to reconcile the imperatives of mass production with consum-\ners\u2019 legitimate desire for personalization.

Not only did the brand go all across the world looking for new trends and ideas, but each new model was also cleverly sent out to opinion-makers who could help to diffuse it by word of mouth. Skechers did everything it could to develop customized contacts with potential clients at two levels:\nn At a very reduced and closed level, designers and marketers would be in direct contact \nwith people we can describe as innovative and wielding a great deal of in\ufb02uence in \nthe fashion world. This included not only stars, but also young people belonging to other professional or cultural tribes. These targets would be offered the latest novelty products in exclusivity, before the articles went on sale in the brand\u2019s 25,000 points-of-sale across the world.\nn At a wider level, a customized contact was developed using a wide array of new \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) resources. Not only were there a number of chat rooms or forum discussion groups to talk about the brand (venues moderated by company representatives 24/7) but, as the brand had developed an Internet-based approach to its marketplace, customers leaving their e-mail address and some personal information would receive personal attention, with the company sending messages relevant to their areas of interest, or on their birthday, or concerning speci\ufb01c actions or company news that could be of interest to them.\nIn the ethical arena, we \ufb01nd brands such as Patagonia, Ben & Jerry\u2019s or The Body Shop. \nConsidering customers as responsible, environmentally concerned individuals is also one way for a company to \u201clook at others in a certain way,\u201d i.e., to see people as targets for its goods. This way of looking at customers conveys meaning. Ultimately, one of the things that consumers in this situation are sanctioning through their purchasing acts is their use of a \u201cre\ufb02ection\u201d process to interpret how they themselves have been construed by the company. If someone is construed as being socially responsible and not irresponsible, this can become the basis for building up a company\u2013consumer connection. It is also a way of using a prod-uct offering\u2019s strong semiological content to develop an experiential approach (Heilbrunn, 2005).\nCompanies are also increasingly being scrutinized by associations and non-governmental \norganizations (NGOs), or their behaviors are being dissected by consumer groups.

Yet these issues are clearly crucial. If the experiential marketing approach lacked \nthis ethical dimension, companies would be at great risk, as the results they \ncould achieve may be the exact opposite of what they were looking for when they \ufb01rst tried to establish a relationship with their clients. Consumers are not at all naive about marketing practices. At the same time, they ask no more than to be able to remain loyal to a brand. Of course, this must be worth it for them, with the brand being sincere in the approach it follows. One relatively eloquent \nexample is the adventure in experiential marketing conducted in Japan by the \nShiseido cosmetics brand. To improve customer relations, Shiseido surveyed customers to identify their positive and negative perceptions of its brand. The general feedback was that, despite Shiseido\u2019s excellent image, problems did ex-ist. Women customers would go to big department stores to buy brand products, but sales staff at these outlets were paid a commission on top of their basic sal-ary. This often gave customers an impression of purchasing greater quantities of good-quality Shiseido products than they really wanted to. As they clearly could not lose face in public, nothing was said at the time, but they would feel a great deal of dissatisfaction afterwards. Shiseido\u2019s marketing department tried to make optimal use of this information to improve its product offer system. It decided to modify its distribution strategy in Japan by developing a new kind of relationship with its customers.\nNew Shiseido outlets were opened up in most of Japan\u2019s major cities. Un-\nlike most of the chain\u2019s existing stores, however, the new ones served solely as advice and brand enhancement centers, places where women could come to put on makeup and receive advice, but not make any purchases. Customers in these new locations had to settle for samples, making their purchases subsequently online using the brand\u2019s website. By acting in this way, Shiseido was making a strong statement to its customers that their relationship to the brand was not only commercial in nature. By combining the advisory center and \u201ce-commerce\u201d concepts, Shiseido changed the way it related to its client base, making the com-mercial side of this relationship less oppressive and omnipresent and trying to create a more balanced company\u2013customer connection. This exempli\ufb01es the fact that, as long as a customer base is being offered an ideological system that cor-responds to its aspirations, it will remain loyal to a company, its values, and what it represents (Hetzel, 1997).

Its initiatives are taken very seriously \non the other side of the Atlantic, where the company has become a strong force for progress (7.5 percent of pretax earnings are given by its foundation to chari-ties, environmental protection causes, or general interest projects). The success of Ben & Jerry\u2019s stems at least as much from its ethical activist commitments as it does from the company\u2019s very real knowhow, particularly its ability to mix of respect is shown for the company\u2019s customers.

In this author\u2019s opinion, experiential approaches occupy a much more central role than they did in the past. Clearly, a distinction should be made between marketer prac-tices and marketing theory.

Ben & Jerry\u2019s sources its coffee from a Mexi-\ncan cooperative called Aztec Harvests; its blueberries from Maine\u2019s Passaqua-mody Native American Indian tribe; and the brownies it uses are manufactured by Greyston, an association that battles social marginalization. Some product sales serve to support greenhouse gas reduction actions, protect the Amazon rainforest, etc. The company regularly takes part in social inclusion operations targeting youths from disadvantaged neighborhoods and asks its franchisees to recruit vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, customers are strongly solicited to give their opinions and can make suggestions about the company\u2019s products, decisions, etc., with consumer representatives even sitting on its board. For ex-ample, customer ideas led to the launch of Ben & Jerry\u2019s \u201cPeace Perfume\u201d and \u201cCherry Garcia\u201d \ufb02avors, the latter in homage to Jerry Garcia, the sadly missed leader of one of the Woodstock generation\u2019s favorite rock bands.\nClearly, there is nothing super\ufb01cial about the experiential construct at Ben & \nJerry\u2019s. This is a very deep-seated approach rooted in a highly ethical concep-tion of the company\u2013consumer relationship. Moreover, there is little doubt that this trend is still in its early days. If we believe that the future is bright for this way of doing business, it is because it is a modus operandi grounded in consumer involvement, meaning that it brings together consumption and action. Some ob-servers already use the expression \u201cbuycott\u201d to counterbalance \u201cboycott.\u201d The idea here is that consumers want to take an active role in the determination of their own destinies and, above all, that they are trying to get more involved in certain purchasing acts, ones that in the past could be trivialized and not very engaging.

Moreover, attempts have been made to leverage the theoreti-cal bases of neighboring disciplines such as linguistics (notably semiotics to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of meaning), sociology, anthropology, and econom-ics (especially industrial economics and the economics of conventions). All one has to do is peruse the contents of marketing research magazines to realize that complexity has pro-gressively replaced more mechanical visions of one\u2019s relationship to the marketplace. Of course, this assertion should also be nuanced, and much as researchers have done, we too have witnessed the use of a diversity of approaches.

In particular, the litera-ture has extensively analyzed entertainment experiences as important examples of hedonic consumption, while education has been viewed as that part of the economy belonging to \u201chigh culture\u201d (generally differentiated from popular culture, which is consumed in the pursuit of functional bene\ufb01ts).\nDespite these speci\ufb01c characteristics, the two areas share the importance of the indi-\nvidual\u2019s immersion into the experience. Only if the contact with the environment in which the experience occurs (or, better, with all the elements of the environment) is close and direct will the individual be able to assimilate the entertainment or educational input and appreciate the experience to the full, so gaining maximum value. This depends in part on the fact that both entertainment and educational experiences are part of the broader world of the services, in which, typically and traditionally, the physical context plays a critical role in determining consumer attitudes and behavior.

In these types of experience, it is dif\ufb01cult for the con-sumer to identify precisely when the experience begins and when it ends (is the experience of a concert just the duration of the performance, or does it begin as the members of the audience prepare at home to attend the concert and end with their memories?). Similarly, it is dif\ufb01cult to distinguish the importance of the social environment of an experience in forming the individual context (is the presence of other colleagues at a scienti\ufb01c seminar just a secondary variable, or does it, too, generate value for the learner?). Or again, what is the role played by staff in an individual\u2019s interaction with an experience (do the staff at a theme park merely help the visitors, or do consumers see them as actors in their own right?)?\nThese dif\ufb01culties in de\ufb01ning an entertainment and an educational experience are the re-\nsult of the central position of the emotions, even predetermined emotions, and the intense involvement of the individual in the course of the experience.\nTherefore, the individual\u2019s immersion in these experiences is critical both for research-\ners who want to understand the signi\ufb01cance and for those interested in the managerial im-plications and opportunities to exploit to the full the economic returns from the underlying investments. If, on the one hand, entertainment has recently been indicated as one of the most signi\ufb01cant areas of western economies (Wolf, 1999), on the other, business schools, for example, are interested in discovering how to use new technologies to design and deliver online courses which overcome the traditional barriers to training (time and space) with direct and immediate interaction.\nIt is precisely the more recent economic trends that have proposed the convergence of \nentertainment and education as a new area of value both for the consumer and for the eco-nomic players, institutions, and companies involved. The ultimate aim is that the learning experience is enriched if the learner is immersed in an entertainment experience. However, in order to understand the logic and identify the best levers, we must focus our attention on the ways in which these two traditionally distant economic \ufb01elds can be integrated.\nTHE DEBATE ON EDUTAINMENT\nThe term edutainment is a neologism to describe an educational experience which is at the same time entertaining. Consequently, edutainment also de\ufb01nes the convergence between two traditionally distinct areas of the economy, entertainment and education. Initially, the term referred to CD-ROMs bridging education and entertainment, which were expected to develop strongly. Recently, however, the scope of edutainment has increased to cover any experience that is in part educational and in part entertaining.\nAlthough the concept of edutainment refers exclusively to the convergence between \neducation, i.e., learning, and entertainment, it is mainly used to de\ufb01ne cases in which this convergence is driven by technology. Despite the apparent simplicity of the de\ufb01nition, a more in-depth analysis of the concept is anything but easy for at least two reasons.\nFirst, it is dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne the scope of edutainment, because the terms education and \nentertainment are themselves not completely clear.

This de\ufb01nition includes schools as well as institutions outside a country\u2019s of\ufb01cial educational system which contribute to its development, e.g., musical, theatrical, etc. On the other hand, the dynamism of entertainment does not help the identi\ufb01cation of those products that fall into this category. Entertainment is, therefore, understood as fun and amusement, a pleasurable activity without any educational implica-tion, symbolized in America, above all, by the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner (King, 1993). Generally speaking, entertainment products are for leisure, so include toys and sports goods, video recorders, televisions and consumer electronics, books, magazines, and newspapers, casinos and betting agencies, theme parks, and amusement arcades. Over-all, the sector is showing strong growth and is expected to be a future dynamo of advanced economies (Wolf, 1999; Askegaard, 2000).\nSecond, the topic has stimulated a lively debate regarding not only its de\ufb01nition, but also, \nalbeit to a lesser extent, its value. There are at least two schools of thought.\nThe \ufb01rst is that derived from traditional pedagogics, which sees entertainment and edu-\ncation almost as opposites. In this case, true learning assumes hard endeavor on the part of the student, which would be dif\ufb01cult to reconcile with entertainment. This position also appears to \ufb01nd fertile ground in the sociological interpretation of experience, which has recently warned of the impact on social and individual development of new trends in west-ern society. The everyday nature of experience is questioning its signi\ufb01cance, impoverishing and ultimately refuting the experience itself. Western societies are becoming the breeding ground of simulation (Jedlowski, 1999). The individual has lost contact with objective real-ity and lives in the midst of a multitude of contexts which are all valid and simultaneously accessible, and all, at the same time, the fruit of simulations. As present-day society is built on \ufb01ction and simulation, it offers indirect experiences, in which the individual is un-able, or maybe unwilling, to learn how reality really is. Learning and the knowledge derived therefrom are reduced to a minimum and even nulli\ufb01ed. Moreover, experience has become a media event.\nThe second position on edutainment and its effects is that which emphasizes the absence \nof any dividing line between education and entertainment. From a less elitist point of view, for education to be effective, the experience must be pleasurable, going as far as to nullify any distinction between entertainment and education (McLuhan, 1960). The theoretical basis of this view is experiential learning theory , i.e., an approach to education that emerged \nin the 1960s. However, the origins of the theory can be traced back to Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget (Kolb, 1984). Very brie\ufb02y, experiential learning theory can be de\ufb01ned as \na sequence of events with one or more identi\ufb01ed learning objectives, requiring active involvement by participants at one or more points in the sequence.

The central tenet of experiential learning is that one learns best by doing.\n(Walter and Marks, 1981, p. 1)\nThe foundation of this theory is, then, the fundamental role of direct experience, explora-tion, and action in learning: \u201cat the heart of all experiential learning theory is the basic belief that effective learning occurs when students are actively involved with an experience and then re\ufb02ect on that experience\u201d (Frontczak and Kelley, 2000, p. 3).\nThe convergence between education and entertainment is primarily driven by multi-\nmedia technologies, i.e., new interactive systems based primarily on CD-ROMs and the Internet, which create virtual reality, or real-time three-dimensional interactive graphic sys-tems (Kinney, 1995). In virtual reality, people are able to interact with digital environments in real time while using their senses; they become active participants in the environment. New technologies possess two important features: interactivity, which is the ability to re-spond to users\u2019 input (Shih, 1998); and the \u201cvirtual\u201d creation of the content of the message transmitted to the consumer, together with delivery to a virtual environment that is more realistic, vivid, and immersive. There is much controversy on this subject (Sullivan, 1998). In particular, Green (2001) suggests that immersive virtual reality systems aim to stimulate the immersion of the consumer in a digital or cyberspace which is generated by informa-tion. Possibly thanks to virtual reality, the concept of immersion is at the base of the area of clinical psychology that studies the human mind in cyberspace (Robillard et al., 2003). \nThe convergence of entertainment and education as a result of the increasing number of technological applications in the areas of art and culture gives rise to a pressing need for in-depth analysis of how such applications impact what these institutions offer from the client\u2019s perspective.\nTHE ROSE CENTER: AN INNOVATIVE EXAMPLE OF \nEDUTAINMENT\nThe Rose Center for Earth and Space, which opened on 19 February 2000, is the latest \nbranch of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York, the second largest museum in the world.

The project, realized by Polshek Partnership Architects, received the Best of 1999 Award from the \nNew York Construction News .\nThe chief architectural element of the new Hayden Planetarium is The Great Sphere. This sphere is built into a glass cube. From an architectural point of view, the Rose Center is considered the \ufb01nest example of a glass-walled construc-tion ever built in the United States. Nearly the entire surface (90.2 percent) is transparent, and it reveals the internal structure of the building, as an act of symbolic demysti\ufb01cation of the science within, sending an explicit invitation to the world outside to enter, and encouraging greater involvement of the general public.\nA broad staircase leads visitors down from the balcony on the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor of the \nbuilding where the Cullman Hall is located. From there, they can take a glass el-evator, which affords a view of the exhibition \ufb02oor from various angles, up to an attic. They then enter the antechamber of the planetarium in almost total dark-ness and watch an introductory video on the Rose Center narrated by Tom Hanks on small television screens. A bridge, also made of glass, links this space with the sphere, the inside of which is divided horizontally into two hemispheres.\nThe top half hosts the new version of the Hayden Planetarium, the core of the \nRose Center. In this case too, the architectural project is brimming with allusions to scienti\ufb01c principles: outside the building, visitors are outside the universe; inside the building, they enter and perceive the universe and their perspective changes. The aim is to make visitors alter their viewpoint, make them aware that the universe works according to a set of physical principles, and that everything is relative.\nThe theater in the Hayden Planetarium is named the Space Theater and is the \nworld\u2019s most technologically innovative installation with the most advanced vis-ual technology, including the Zeiss Star, a customized, state-of-the-art star pro-jector, and the Digital Dome Projection System. The Zeiss Star projector is the result of adaptations of the company\u2019s most advanced projector, the Mark VIII, requested by Jim Sweitzer, an astrophysicist and director of special projects for the planetarium, and Neil Tyson, the director of the centre.\nThese modi\ufb01cations were so radical that the museum\u2019s projector is the \ufb01rst of \na new series: Mark IX.

The continual function-ing of this equipment over time is guaranteed by video data, interactive comput-ers, and computerized animation that is constantly updated. The most signi\ufb01cant example is the AstroBulletin, a set of twenty video wall panels that show up-to-the-minute images from space and give the latest space news, including ongoing missions. In this room, there are also eight stations that allow visitors to discover what their weight would be on Jupiter, the Sun, Saturn, a neutron star, Halley\u2019s comet, and a giant red star.\nCullman Hall affords a view of the entire structure. The various elements de-\nscribed here seem like fragments of an exploratory mission in which visitors have participated. Standing under the sphere in the center of the hall, you have the impression of facing an enormous asteroid which has fallen to earth from space.

On the one hand, the architecture aims to create an environment in which visitors are not passive spectators, but active participants. The environment contributes to the development of the experience enjoyed. On the other hand, the use of technology seeks to integrate the exhibition modes. The attention paid to the presentation of just a small number of objects explicitly tries to create, rather than simply recount, the concepts of astrophysics. There is greater interactiv-ity offering new opportunities. One interesting conclusion that can be drawn from the im-portance given to technology and the limited number of exhibits is that, with the exception of a few cases, the Rose Center does not house objects for conservation, but works above all to increase and disseminate knowledge. What is very clear from the case vignettes is that the two sides of the investment must be strictly interrelated.\nIndeed, although some variables can be traced back to education (the emphasis on re-\nsearch, employment of staff with PhDs, exhibition of old and rare scienti\ufb01c tools) and others to entertainment (computer workstations, video-clips, audio recordings, the technologically advanced equipment and facilities in the Space Theater), in other cases, the distinction is not so clear. This is true, for example, of the development and use of the world\u2019s largest stellar database (with important contributions from NASA, ESA, and the museum\u2019s scientists) as the basis for a virtual theater designed and built with the help of SIGGRAPH99, one of the most experienced software houses in the \ufb01eld of entertainment. The theater is used for edu-cational and entertainment purposes, as well as for scienti\ufb01c research. Regarding the former, there are, in particular, the shows, for which the music and all the details have been carefully created. With respect to the latter, seminars and scienti\ufb01c meetings are held in the theater and use its equipment. In other words, it is dif\ufb01cult to distinguish between entertainment and education, and it becomes very evident that the Rose Center is a composite reality in which education and entertainment are intertwined and produce an intense experience of edutainment.\nAn innovative project, updating the scienti\ufb01c data and develop-\ning an entertainment component\nAnother very important aspect of the case is its innovativeness. The Rose Center wanted to \nchange the rules of the game. The shared cultural project was combined with a signi\ufb01cant investment to realize something new that would be seen as a reference point not only for the present, but also for future generations. From this point of view, it is obvious that the innovativeness of the project architecture, technologies, and displays attracted the interest of the media and the general public, so guiding and mediating the success of the institution.\nCase vignette 10.2 reveals that one of the drivers of the investments by management is the \nscienti\ufb01c data.

All the exhibits in the Rose Center, even those that seek to involve \nvisitors through entertainment, are based on the most up-to-date scienti\ufb01c information. Thus, even where astrophysics is simpli\ufb01ed in order to facilitate the involvement of the general public, it remains completely reliable precisely because it is based on continuously updated scienti\ufb01c data, which serve as the reference database for the discipline.\nThe Rose Center was at the heart of an intense debate as a result of the considerable \ninvestments made to involve the general public in an entertaining way. Over and above any value judgments, this is clearly an element of the experience offered by the center and, in particular, of the Hayden Planetarium and the shows that it hosts.\nDifferentiation of experience on the basis of the skills of the \nreference target\nA very evident strategy in case vignettes 10.1 and 10.2 is the differentiation of the experi-\nences offered, which are clearly de\ufb01ned in the \ufb01nest detail. In building an up-to-date, scien-ti\ufb01c center with a complex and elaborate structure, management has aimed to create differ-ent experiences for different targets. On the one hand, the astronomers, astrophysicists, and other members of the scienti\ufb01c community have an important facility for study and scienti\ufb01c advance, including through the social contacts made possible via the center. On the other hand, the general public, who would be little inclined to study astronomy in depth, can enjoy an experience designed to stimulate the interest and curiosity that are prerequisites of the passion necessary to address this discipline. The variable used to differentiate the service offered and to segment the Rose Center\u2019s target audience is, then, the level of expertise. For those with little experience, the objective is to generate interest and, to ful\ufb01ll this objective, a strategy explicitly emphasizing entertainment has been developed. As the level of expertise increases, the entertainment component falls, while the level of detailed analysis of the skills generated rises.\nIt is by means of these three lessons that the association between education and entertain-\nment becomes a balance which can increase the advantages of the experience. Management\u2019s attention to interactivity and the pleasure of the experience does not aim to cannibalize the educational role of the institution. At the Rose Center, the most advanced technologies and the techniques taken from entertainment seem to be at the service of education. The center uses different elements in its technologies, architecture, and displays to involve the multisensory experiences of its visitors. Case vignette 10.3 clearly reveals the considerable effort by management and the players involved in the project to integrate the various ele-ments coherently. The history of the design and realization of the project illustrates that the American Museum of Natural History has paid close attention to the planning and manage-ment of the services offered and to the integration between the visitor and the knowledge that the museum wishes to disseminate. In particular, the application of new technologies to education enriches and transforms the visitors\u2019 experience. Especially regarding museums, the visitors\u2019 perception of an innovative experience can be totally different from that of a traditional museum visit.

This means that the difference between services offered, a key principle of the modern age, becomes increasingly unstable, creat-ing, again in the words of the sociologist, a situation of dedifferentiation, i.e., dif\ufb01culty in differentiating objects and places, because everything is subject to implosion.\nIt has already been shown, albeit in speci\ufb01c and well-de\ufb01ned \ufb01elds of learning, that \nthe variety of tools used improves individual learning, as the variety of learning styles can be addressed. This does not mean that visitors will become astrophysicists, nor is this the management\u2019s objective. The center simply wants to arouse curiosity for further study in the future. This should overcome the argument about the presumed numbing of individuals\u2019 ability to reason caused by the use of technological applications. Indeed, one report has warned of the danger that the knowledge acquired via the new technologies is so prepacked that it requires no effort in terms of personal elaboration or interpretation (Kinney, 1995). If this thesis can be considered reasonable, at least potentially, nevertheless it must also be recognized that one of the possible advantages of innovative applications is the integration and combination of traditionally distinct and unrelated disciplines. T radition and innovation therefore complement rather than replace each other.\nTHE ROLE OF THE CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE IN \nTHE REDEFINITION OF THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN INDUSTRIES AND THE RULES OF COMPETITION\nThe Rose Center case clearly shows that the consumption experience is a very powerful fac-\ntor in the convergence between sectors. Convergence is not based exclusively on technologi-cal applications. The exhibition mode and the architectural structure in general play a very important role in making the experience both pleasurable and useful. What these types of investment have in common is that they all have an impact on the interactive and participa-tive dimension of the experience. Interaction is, therefore, the core of the experience. Con-sequently, anything that stimulates interaction increases the value of the experience itself.\nIf, then, interaction is the core of experience, its direct and immediate consequence, i.e., \nimmersion, is the value perceived by consumers, through which they obtain other, impor-tant, long-term bene\ufb01ts. In the present case, the immersion of the individual facilitated by the stimulation of entertainment becomes the vehicle by which learning (or at least interest in future investigation) is maximized. By means of the elements described, the educational message is enriched with new aspects that not only provide greater detail and information, so enhancing the reach of education, but also exploit consumers\u2019 multisensory faculties, rendering the involvement more profound.\nGiven this increase in the reach of individual experience, new opportunities arise for \ncompanies and economic bodies.

This means seeking a market position that is determined as much by emotional as by rational considerations, and breaking with the classical distinctions by sector.\nThe present case shows how the traditional divisions by sector become invalid, especially \nwhen applied to the study of contemporary and innovative phenomena. The so-called expe-riential differentiation strategy involves de\ufb01ning a product that not only satis\ufb01es functional and social needs, but also offers emotional bene\ufb01ts. Moreover, if this is a result that can be pursued with success in education (which, as we have seen, is generally considered to be opposed to entertainment), then the same strategy can be pro\ufb01tably, and probably more easily, adopted in many other sectors closer to entertainment. Thus, it is very clear that experiential differentiation can constitute a valid strategy for institutions and companies seeking to reposition in the market and revitalize their product range.\nObviously, the realization of a strategy that potentially offers important advantages re-\nquires careful attention, above all in addressing innovation and project complexity .\nThe former concerns policy to select, manage, and exploit the skills to be used in the \nplanning and realization of the consumption experience. Although this has always been a critical issue, it is even more so with regard to experiential differentiation. There are two dif\ufb01culties. On the one hand, skills come from various businesses, which may even be far from the company\u2019s or institution\u2019s core activities, and are therefore unfamiliar to manage-ment. Marketing managers cannot oversee these skills, because they lack the cognitive tools to assess them effectively. On the other hand, these skills acquire value not by themselves, but by integration, making leverage even more problematic.\nThe second major dif\ufb01culty in experiential differentiation strategies is the active par-\nticipation of the customer. Precisely because interaction is the main source of value for the customer from the experience, it is critical for the market success of the experience. This critical aspect is further combined with the impossibility for management to control each single component of the experience and each single interaction with the individual. Giving consumers power even in their involvement in the creation of an experience means adopt-ing an innovative marketing policy (with the derived advantages in terms of competitive position), but also leads to a situation in which management loses the responsibility, at least in part, for the success of the experience. If consumers contribute actively and decisively (and beyond management\u2019s control) to the creation of the experience, then the replicability and the control of the process become critical elements in the realization and commercial exploitation of this experience.\nConsequently, experiential differentiation, which is based on convergence between sec-\ntors, could be the competitive strategy of the future. On the one hand, it offers signi\ufb01cant advantages but, on the other, it also requires innovative project planning and administration skills, in which management must be suitably prepared.\nIt is clear that the starting point must be a shared project and shared objectives within \nthe organization.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5057aaa1-6ae7-4930-ac96-1ff3a9660b65": {"__data__": {"id_": "5057aaa1-6ae7-4930-ac96-1ff3a9660b65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0df96fe4-003a-43d0-9f61-865dbced5408", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "29d7e18630a7c196e2bd11c57618af57630bcea085bd4ba02eb87cbc2b9d9567", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "08f37cde-e1fd-4d6d-8af3-a433e0193017", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b659f8b98483431d9f860ab82a0e5b65f0329b78fbe1cb0bc9bcf86f2586a0cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "914b9268-18c3-4f79-bee3-581d3548db73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e94098352b8f9f8c294cab3d36e62e98910a4d1cb9a9d5ebbd403cddbb4bab0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PODEST\u00c0 AND ADDIS\nn 152DISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn Why does the consumption experience have an impact on competition between \ncompanies?\nn Which product factors must be controlled in seeking differentiation based on \nconsumption experience?\nn What problems does the innovation of an experiential formula present over time?\nn Why does the realization of consumption experiences require strong integration of \ndifferent skills?\nn With which operational activities and mechanisms can the varied skills needed to \ncreate an intersectorial consumption experience be integrated?\nREFERENCES\nAskegaard, S.

The large global brands have gradually taken over and, with them, their accom-panying commercial logic. This is true for all brands, but refers above all to the brands of products in the sports sector. These tend ever more to build communication worlds that are fascinating for consumers and to translate these worlds in various ways on to the physical and experiential plane with events, tournaments, \ufb01tness centers, sales points, etc. This also has consequences at a social level, in as much as the widespread appeal exercised by the worlds of sporting brands contributes in a signi\ufb01cant manner to the creation of a gradual process of \u201csporti\ufb01cation\u201d of society.\nIf this has happened, it is because sport represents a universal language able to attract \na high level of involvement in all cultures. It is therefore particularly useful for the com-munication of brands with a need to be \u201cglobal\u201d (Aaker and Joachimsthaler, 2000). But this has also happened because the brands themselves have begun to develop particularly KEY POINTS\nn Today, brands develop strategies that are focused on experience in order to \ninvolve an expert consumer who is ever more difficult to reach.\nn In order to function better, brands construct specific cultural images that \nare based on social values.\nn Brands tend to enter into the most private experience of an individual, that \nof values, and can influence this space.\nn Television, which sells sports events spectators to firms, is one of the factors \nthat contribute most to the transformation of sport from the point of view \nof consumption.\nn The main sporting brands present worlds with values that involve the \nconsumers and contribute to making sport ever more consumption oriented.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1933, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13881bd2-1b97-438d-92c6-d75c84c97325": {"__data__": {"id_": "13881bd2-1b97-438d-92c6-d75c84c97325", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ea9354f5-046e-40f9-8e8f-ea0aa203428d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "e7d6cfa8209acb0898ecb79d716969d3b0affb61d28a24879a2c73810b7bd672", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5d30dad-dac8-4652-aee1-73af33ac7ea3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "4757aa527159766f9b7fd62ae3e572ff787bb4994338cc125a5556d7a0cd28dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e3ad9cb-f898-4969-80f0-1906e8c3f41e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92b75062ff9768862c86bb152a4fbe1d08b2030b52addae2a2b6ab767687dac1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HOW VALUE-BASED BRANDS CREATE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE\n155 nsophisticated communication strategies focused on the concept of experience. Indeed, this \nhas become the main goal, as it allows an expert consumer to become involved and because it is ever more dif\ufb01cult to reach. We will therefore use the concept of experience as our starting point in reconstructing the \u201cexperience\u201d strategies used by the main global brands and the processes of change in sports brands.\nTHE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF \nEXPERIENCE\nAmong the aspects that are most characteristic of the evolutionary phase of western social \nsystems, the development of an esthetic of sensation which seeks to stimulate the body using the immediateness of its primary processes (aroused by desire), the communicative capa-bilities of sounds and images (all that is not conversational), and the possibilities provided by immersion of a previously detached subject into an experience must be considered to be particularly important (Featherstone, 1991). This aspect is certainly not new to social culture. It can be found, for example, in the excitement, uncontrolled emotion, and direct physical pleasure experienced in the \u201cchaos\u201d of carnivals, popular festivals, and fairs that took place in the Middle Ages. At the time, however, these experiences were limited to the working classes and to certain times, and only later spread to the middle classes. It was above all the new places of consumption (in the nineteenth century, the voyages,  department \nstores, and universal exhibitions; in the twentieth century, the shopping centers, airports, and theme parks) that offered this experience of cultural disorder which, in the past, had belonged to the carnivals, popular festivals, and fairs (Codeluppi, 2000). Actually, we are not really talking about the same experience, as the process of civilizing imposed physical and emotional control on the middle classes. What these classes felt was only an \u201cordered disorder\u201d (Featherstone, 1991).\nHowever, the fact remains that, in recent decades, individuals have sought ever more \nintensely the sensations and emotions produced by experiences. What we want to buy today is an experience and not merely a product. Consequently, even \ufb01rms, having passed from product to brand, are now progressively focusing on a new concept of marketing which is called \u201cesthetic\u201d (Schmitt and Simonson, 1997) and \u201cexperience\u201d (Schmitt, 1999). They are increasingly trying to make consumers feel physical and emotional sensations during their experiences with products and brands. These sensations are stimulated by all the forms of communication, by the product design, but, above all, they \ufb02ourish in new places of consumption.\nThe importance of the atmosphere created in the sales environment as a means of in-\n\ufb02uencing buying behavior had already been underlined in the 1970s (Kotler, 1973\u201374). It was, however, necessary to arrive at the current situation of communication saturation at all levels of society to take more decisive action and give greater visibility to the subjects who communicate. This is why today there is great emphasis in the places of consumption on the exploitation of a certain theme, or rather on \u201ctheming,\u201d a technique of self-representation that focuses on a particular conceptual category which should already be known to users and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3362, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e3ad9cb-f898-4969-80f0-1906e8c3f41e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e3ad9cb-f898-4969-80f0-1906e8c3f41e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "156", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a439c9c7-91bb-41a3-81b7-d4efb3238b27", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "156", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b30b547748f97b9886e81d35c69d9c1ac96cea40fa6b79858bb3cabd5dfbb5b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13881bd2-1b97-438d-92c6-d75c84c97325", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "d4084a1afc0dc20392459ce5d787d1a5920047ad05aa464564afda40b3056ce1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "feaaa721-5e16-499b-ae48-f6a96db71660", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "35870940984df6350c3e226da3daa3a8841eb46a028bb6c175e22ba1147ce0fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CODELUPPI\nn 156should therefore generate a high level of involvement. Any geographical, mythical, historical, \ncurrent, or future place can be used for theming, providing it is suf\ufb01ciently attractive. Above all, however, the chosen theme must be presented in such a way as to create an experience or, rather, something that changes people in a certain way so that they are no longer the same after having tried it. Any experience, be it weak or strong, will be integrated into a person\u2019s knowledge as \u201cpersonal baggage,\u201d which will be remembered over time.\nIMAGES OF BRAND AND VALUES\nAll the major global brands today use the communication tools at their disposal to build a speci\ufb01c, but extremely intriguing and seductive, world around their products. This world is autonomous and refers only to itself. It is for the most part immaterial, but represents for the consumer a precise reality that can be tried out, something extremely concrete. At the same time, it has been known for some time that the media can operate socially by \u201cduplicating reality,\u201d i.e., by placing next to reality another reality that is just as \u201ctrue\u201d for individuals, even if it is a purely virtual place. Similarly, the new communication reality produced by brands seems to be transformed through the media into a real and concrete object. This is because we are talking about a reality that has been given richness and com-municative density, but also because this reality tends to establish a continual relationship with the consumer through various communication channels (advertising, direct marketing, marketing events, Internet, point-of-sale communication, etc.). Reality has an ever more concrete representation through those spectacular consumer spaces that are built by many global brands (Codeluppi, 2000).\nThe communication worlds of brands have been called the \u201cpossible worlds of the brand\u201d \n(Semprini, 1996). These possible worlds are mainly:\nn \ufb01ctional, but can sometimes appear to be particularly close to day-to-day reality and \ntherefore use a realistic language;\nn internally coherent, with respect to their past history and the expectations of the target \nmarket with regard to the represented world;\nn highly differentiated from the similar worlds of competing brands;\nn selective of their speci\ufb01c audience.\nSemprini has further maintained that, despite their high level of de\ufb01nition, these possible \nworlds of the brand remain virtual worlds that can be made concrete only with the funda-\nmental contribution of the eventual target. Therefore, \u201cthe brand does not construct the possible world alone. It is the consumers who by subscribing to the imaginary construction set up by the brand attribute a \u2018real\u2019 existence to this world\u201d (Semprini, 1996, p. 141).\nHowever, the concept of a possible world is limited with respect to the richness and \ncommunicative power of today\u2019s most important brands. What these brands really de\ufb01ne is a true and proper cultural image. This is an image that naturally cannot be constructed ex \nnovo, but develops by appropriating a portion of the wider social imagination.

In contemporary society saturated by communica-tion in all its forms, and where products are increasingly similar to each other and therefore less attractive to consumers, it is not enough to communicate the existence of a product or information about the bene\ufb01ts that a product can offer. It is imperative to impose one\u2019s presence by communicating a speci\ufb01c identity.\nFurthermore, brands cannot limit themselves to giving their own name to a certain line \nof products, they must propose models of behavior, a lifestyle, an esthetic, and even social and moral values. Without the foundation of a social value, the image of the brand is weaker. It is, on the other hand, now clear that a brand that proposes values sets itself up as an extremely in\ufb02uential interlocutor, able to demonstrate the principles that should inspire and direct behavior. Consumer identi\ufb01cation with the brand therefore becomes particularly profound.\nThe brand is not able to create new values, it can only reinforce those that already exist, \nand consequently seeks to acquire one of these values (case vignette 11.1). The result is that the \ufb01rm is transformed into a powerful social actor that tends to invade the private space of individuals and penetrate ever more deeply into their lives (Holt, 2005). What really hap-pens in a situation such as today\u2019s crisis in the system of past certainties (values, traditions) is that \u201cwe live in a society where common ideals and political resolve have been largely replaced by shared meanings revolving around brand names and advertising images\u201d (Lewis and Bridger, 2000, p. 13). We need to ask whether this does not lead to consequences for individuals and society as a whole. It is clear that that which in the past was developed within a collective elaboration of social culture is increasingly delegated to \ufb01rms. This becomes par-ticularly serious if values are seen as a basic element that should guide the cultural dynamics of any society. It is no coincidence that today \u201cbrands have the potential to become the new centers of community\u201d (Atkin, 2004, p. 200).\nCASE VIGNETTE 11.1: \u201cJUST DO IT\u201d\nNike\u2019s advertising slogan \u201c Just do it\u201d probably derives from the world of running \nwhere the \ufb01rm made its \ufb01rst impact. As the product range gradually expanded, however, Nike developed this concept of individual challenge, seeking to respond to the typically US desire of people who want to feel free from the institutional aspect of sport, i.e., sport dominated by Olympic federations and teams, as in the \nEuropean sporting tradition. Gradually, this individualistic conception of sport \nhas placed Nike at the opposite end of the spectrum to Baron de Coubertin\u2019s classic conception of sport as a competition for moral bene\ufb01t (\u201cThe important thing is not the winning but the taking part\u201d).

Sporting events are now more geared toward being seen by paying spectators and are therefore being de\ufb01ned with a view to being played in purpose-built arenas (tracks, stadiums). At the same time, athletes have also become professionals who receive appropriate compensation.\nThis process has affected all sports. For example, professional football started in England \nin 1885. A little later, con\ufb01rming the increasing industrialization of sport, many large \ufb01rms created football teams: Fiat (Juventus), Philips (PSV Eindhoven), Bayer (Bayer Leverkusen), Peugeot (Sochaux), and Guichard (Saint Etienne). T eams were already managed industri-ally and professionally, even if they of\ufb01cially respected the amateur rules. The timing of the recognition of professionalism in football in fact varied between countries: 1924 in Austria, 1929 in Italy, 1932 in France, and 1963 in Germany. In 1903, the journalists of the that Nike evokes are universal. They are applied to all types of sport, but also to \nall pro\ufb01les, from Michael Jordan to the Sunday sportsman. And this ethic can cross the boundaries of sport and be applied in all areas of life (Riou, 1999, p. 81). \u201c Just do it\u201d therefore underlines the effort and the action with which any individual can win a personal challenge and reach a goal This slogan also works because, semantically, its meaning is not precisely de\ufb01ned. It is suf\ufb01ciently am-biguous to be interpreted differently by different people.\nConsequently, a large number of Nike contracts are given to sports personali-\nties such as Ilie Nastase, John McEnroe, Andr\u00e9 Agassi, or Charles Barkley, all with strong and independent personalities representing individualistic values, the difference of the individual with regard to the social system. Above all, however, the brand values have been incarnated by basketball star Michael Jordan. Be-yond the extraordinary sporting results of the athlete, the merit of this choice should be attributed to the \ufb01rm\u2019s decision to make Jordan the focal point of its marketing and communication strategy. Nike has concentrated its attention and investments on various high-quality adverts in which Jordan is shown as a \u201csu-perman\u201d who literally \ufb02ies into the air to make a basket. His nickname, \u201cair,\u201d derived from his great jumping skills, has been effectively translated to the visual level, as the image showing him airborne has become the graphic brand of the Air Jordan product range.

Some sporting disciplines \nhave resisted transformation more than others, but sooner or later they have succumbed. T ennis, for example, refused to admit professional players into its prestigious international competitions until 1968. The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) only began to ac-cept the new reality in 1983. However, amateurism was already an illusion in the 1950s and 1960s, as the most important \ufb01rms gave the best athletes fees to use their products. The phenomenon exploded at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, where the Adidas and Puma brands were involved in a dispute relating to the fees paid to athletes to wear their shoes (Vanderbilt, 1998).\nDuring the 1980s, businessmen such as Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Bernard T apie in \nFrance completely transformed the management of football teams, integrating them into a wider business and \ufb01nancial strategy. The teams from the big cities (Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich) became global brands, less tied to a speci\ufb01c geographical area, often quoted on the Stock Exchange (and therefore conditioned by the price of the shares), and able to generate pro\ufb01ts not through the sale of match tickets, which were in constant decline, but, above all, from television rights and merchandising. Obviously, this was true only for the \u00e9lite teams, while those from small cities are generally not able to keep up and begin to constitute a burden. The replacement of the old European Cup with the Champions League was an attempt to reinforce the big clubs, because it is the television spectacle rather than the live match which is fundamental. T elevision has been one of the prime factors in making sport more professional and ever more linked to the industrial and consumer system. T elevision networks make substantial investments to buy the transmission rights for the main events from sporting clubs. They know that they can sell the advertising slots linked to these events at a high price, because the matches attract many viewers who are not simply spectators, but fans who are emotionally involved in their \u201chome team\u201d and, it is hoped, equally involved when they watch the advertising.\nCASE VIGNETTE 11.2: THE OLYMPICS OF BRANDS\nThe Olympics demonstrate in the most obvious way the gradual commercializa-\ntion of sport. Already in the nineteenth century, bourgeois culture had begun to promote the value of professionalism and an \u201cindustrial\u201d conception of sport, a conception directly derived from the Industrial Revolution and its conception of the body as a machine. It is not, therefore, surprising that the modern Olympics, \nwhich began in 1896, have been in\ufb02uenced by this conception. For example, the \nParis Games in 1900 took place in the large arena usually used for universal exhibitions (Vigarello, 2002).\nDuring the course of the twentieth century, however, the Olympics also moved \ntoward a greater focus on spectacle, again changing the nature of the games from the point of view of consumption. What in the past was the incarnation of the moral purity of amateur sport has become an extraordinarily ef\ufb01cient", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3331, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "617dbf27-210b-4d4b-a8b1-a9ffb3240e23": {"__data__": {"id_": "617dbf27-210b-4d4b-a8b1-a9ffb3240e23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "375bdd27-6a32-4ffd-916e-8ee8f6dc64cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b6502842cc1308615ab34466a81bf0325b049f25a2e8f02db303b66310c4775a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e895f37b-fdf2-4fee-bf6f-51a1a890f160", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "d73c70a0b8965ab2368a9e94cec80876c930d121aaa319f1ce252b4ef55536d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d944ad35-c9e7-4c86-abd9-69c1749c1b8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1f6b0830e2c474d681e2df83bbb64dc25c486e1d27341d3f85205233fa137e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CODELUPPI\nn 160Sporting events further stimulate consumption by placing the brand or an advertising \nslogan right at the center of the action, where the hearts and minds of the spectators are \nconcentrated (case vignette 11.2). When watching a Formula 1 or motorcycling Grand Prix, the spectator sees a number of adverts, but also the brands on the drivers\u2019 helmet or overalls, on the racing car, on the side of the track, on the buildings by the track, and sometimes even on the track itself. Even the colors of the cars have become those of the sponsors. For example, Ferrari, the most prestigious team in the world, has given up its famous red and taken on the shades of red of its main sponsor, Marlboro. Also, at football matches, the sponsors appear everywhere: on the players\u2019 shirts, on the side of the pitch, behind players being interviewed, etc.\nIt should also be remembered that sport on television is not seen directly, but through \na medium that inevitably alters the spectacle. Indeed, \u201cthe screen does not allow us to see better, but creates a new way of seeing. It immerses the television viewer directly inside the promotion tool for global brands. The ten main sponsors of the 1996 Atlanta \nOlympics together invested $1.5 billion, a fact symbolized in the Olympic Village \nitself where \u201csix McDonald\u2019s restaurants served 7500 free meals a day, while \na Burger King hot-air balloon simultaneously dominated the sky above\u201d (Miles, 1998, p. 130). This process has been pursued further at subsequent Olympics. At \nAthens 2004, for example, television shots were so calibrated that they always \nincluded at least one \u201ctop sponsor\u201d brand, while even the bodies of the athletes became seductive \u201cconsumer objects.\u201d They are now good-looking, erotic images rather than sporting examples. One of the most popular television sports is now \nwomen\u2019s beach volleyball, an insigni\ufb01cant sport until a few years ago, but now \nconsidered sexy because of the extremely skimpy out\ufb01ts worn by the players.\nToday, the Olympics are essentially a made-for-television event. Only one in \n100,000 people who watch the games see them in person. For most people, the Olympics are strictly a TV experience. Thus, the ability of television to hold the \naudience\u2019s attention is critical for the brands. However, the increasing inclusion \nof brands can spoil the consumer experience:\nI love watching the Olympics and have spent a very lazy weekend doing little else but . . . my one big problem is the commercial side of the games. I am \namazed that people are being told they are not allowed to wear their own \nchoice of clothes, use camcorders/cameras, drink their own water, use certain umbrellas, eat certain types of food unless it is provided by one of the spon-soring companies. This attitude is disgusting and is ruining the games and no wonder there are so few tickets sold.\n(Rob, York, UK)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2888, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d944ad35-c9e7-4c86-abd9-69c1749c1b8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d944ad35-c9e7-4c86-abd9-69c1749c1b8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "213c2c37-692d-429a-9d85-25baaaf349ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "88ee9bbef879f99fee877610a6fc3fb16b20a8d629977f4238bdf1df178f0f2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "617dbf27-210b-4d4b-a8b1-a9ffb3240e23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "b6502842cc1308615ab34466a81bf0325b049f25a2e8f02db303b66310c4775a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4a0f90a-4ee6-4e07-8543-aed2b4b59c7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c999fb66f3f70edf5774bcf1365dc913375e6eeacce279561eca5ade2b9df3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "HOW VALUE-BASED BRANDS CREATE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE\n161 nmyth, within a story constructed outside the game, made for the viewer, exciting and seduc-\ntive\u201d (Vigarello, 2002, p. 161). What is presented on television differs from what is seen at the stadium. The television director of necessity makes various changes to the competition, breaking up the unity of the game by \u201czooming in,\u201d repeating and slowing down the most spectacular scenes. T elevision shows the face of the competitor close up (above all in motor sports), it increases the viewpoints, even taking in things that are not directly relevant to the action; it emphasizes scenes that do not have a competitive importance but are valuable for the media. Sport on television is a narrative and so more spectacular. The television director accelerates the tendency to narrative of various sports, demanding that they adapt to the rhythms of television, which are the frenetic rhythms of advertising.\nThe increasingly consumer-oriented nature of sport is also clear from the role played \nby important athletes, whose fame is the base of the whole sporting system today. They are seen as gods like the cinema celebrities and are able to ask enormous salaries without any feelings of affection for the team for which they play. In any case, they receive only part of their earnings from the team, with greater amounts coming from advertising endorsements. For footballers such as Beckham, Zidane, and Ronaldo, these activities represent more than 50 percent of their earnings. Furthermore, thanks to the \u201cBosman law,\u201d all European foot-ballers have become freely exchangeable \u201cgoods,\u201d meaning that the teams have fewer local players from their own country.\nIt is therefore not surprising that the big stars of sport lead their public lives more off the \npitch than on it. The growing number of romantic ties between sportsmen and actresses, the steady \ufb02ow of news about their private lives, their appearances at events such as fashion shows or on television programs, and the portrayal of famous sports stars and \u201csporting \ufb01ction\u201d in adverts for the main brands all create a dimension outside the sport that tends to absorb the sporting environment and create abstract icons which are easily consumed throughout the world. A perfect example of this phenomenon is the English footballer David Beckham: blond and handsome, married to Victoria Adams, ex-member of the pop group Spice Girls, and comparable to a rock star in the way he is treated by the media.\nTHE IMAGES OF SPORTS BRANDS\nIn recent years, a particularly fascinating, symbolic merchandising universe has arisen for sports shoes. This universe is now appearing in ordinary clothing as well and is a part of the trend toward informal and casual dressing. This is surprising if we remember that, a little over a century ago, canvas shoes were considered poor footwear and were usually associated with thieves and criminals. With the process of vulcanization patented by Charles Goodyear in 1839, rubber could be used for footwear and,  in the 1860s, the English aristocrats were the \ufb01rst to wear very simple canvas, rubber-soled shoes to play grass sports. These later led to the \ufb01rst shoes for playing tennis, and many \ufb01rms began industrial production of sports shoes. In the United States, the market for sports shoes expanded rapidly after World War I because the Americans began to play more sport and pay attention to their physical well-being (Vanderbilt, 1998).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3483, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4a0f90a-4ee6-4e07-8543-aed2b4b59c7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4a0f90a-4ee6-4e07-8543-aed2b4b59c7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5afe3ed0-f448-47e4-b63a-e5baad89e35a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "abc9e31f1c37e102803dcb07c7f20b4a9ab7c7218ac600beea292ae657da796f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d944ad35-c9e7-4c86-abd9-69c1749c1b8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "161", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "88ee9bbef879f99fee877610a6fc3fb16b20a8d629977f4238bdf1df178f0f2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0235abfb-62a7-4f0d-841c-c491fa7b20b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ced9adb7239e562dca529f27257fe58a5d64ceb0934f0d0093fa1b8081ced9d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CODELUPPI\nn 162Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Dassler family created the Dassler \nSchufabrik in Germany in 1926. Their shoes were worn by many athletes at the 1928 and \n1932 Olympics and, above all, by the American runner/jumper Jesse Owens (winner of four gold medals) at the 1936 Games in Berlin. The two brothers, Adi and Rudi Dassler, split up in 1948, founding Adidas and Puma respectively. Adidas gradually emerged as the market leader thanks to its ability in creating innovative products, such as spiked shoes, football boots with studs screwed into the soles, etc. It was only in the early 1970s, however, that the company managed to become the global market leader, distributing its immediately recognizable products (thanks to the three parallel stripes) everywhere. During this same period, Nike was founded in Beaverton, Oregon, by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, demand in the sports shoes and clothing market grew \nenormously. This success was linked to the appearance on the mid-1970s social scene of the so-called \u201cme generation\u201d or the \u201cbaby boom\u201d generation. These were people who grew up in the 1960s, an era in which the value of informality was highly appreciated, but who were, above all, very egocentric and mainly focused on developing their physique. As a result, great attention was paid to physical well-being and health. In particular, jogging developed, and Nike knew how to take advantage of this phenomenon. While Adidas continued to look to professional runners, Nike focused its strategies decisively on amateurs and, by the end of the 1970s, half the running shoes sold were branded Nike.\nThe Beaverton \ufb01rm emerged primarily thanks to its advertising ability, which leads the \nworld. One reason may be that Nike has stopped seeking to show the quality of its products in its adverts. It simply presents values and cultural models. However, behind their apparent diversity, these adverts use the same irreverent language and express the same concept: the individual\u2019s need for a challenge, the lack of interest in others, the test of physical and mental limits (as the advertising slogan \u201cJust do it\u201d states).\nIn Europe as well, Nike has been successful thanks to a particularly aggressive and en-\ngaging advertising language, which has been particularly appreciated by young people who identify with this brand, partly because it comes from the United States, a fashionable nation and the home of jogging, but mainly because it focuses on irreverence. Adidas, in contrast, has normally used less strong language and focused on belonging: these are the shoes that your father and grandfather wore (Aaker and Joachimsthaler, 2000).\nIn recent years, however, Adidas has relaunched its image, so that it now competes di-\nrectly with Nike. It has done this by using the same type of advertising language as its competitor, innovative and engaging, but to communicate almost the opposite value-based world. While Nike has exploited an egoistic view of individual challenge, Adidas has pro-posed a model hinged on professionalism and competence, which in certain ways can be considered \u201caltruistic,\u201d as it shows famous athletes performing good actions.

Re-enchantment of consump-tion can be de\ufb01ned as a set of practices initiated by both manufacturers and consumers to incorporate non-functional sources of value in goods and services, and turn them into sources of hedonic, symbolic, and interpersonal value. Following this conceptualization, re-enchantment of retailing would then be viewed as a set of practices initiated by retail-ers and customers that activate non-functional sources of value during a store visit. It is to be noted that, despite the recognition of the multiple dimensions of retail value, retailing executives and academic researchers tend to focus on a single dimension in positioning retailing formats: at one end of the continuum, the store would be mostly perceived as a mere source of supplies, a point of purchase, and shopping value would be mostly derived from the functional ef\ufb01ciency of the store environment (\ufb01nding the right item, at the low-est price, with minimum effort and time investment). At the other end of the continuum, the store has turned into a source of entertainment, competing with movie multiplexes and theme parks; visiting the store is a constant source of stimulations and hedonic grati\ufb01cations, with the purchasing of products or services as only a side-bene\ufb01t. The implementation of re-enchantment strategies in retailing focuses primarily on this second orientation. What is usually called \u201cre-enchantment of retailing\u201d is essentially extraordinary re-enchantment, as can be found in such settings as megamalls or extremely spectacular \ufb02agship stores or themed restaurants, i.e., \u201cmeans of consumption\u201d (Ritzer, 1999). This is a major shift from the theory of the re-enchantment of consumption that recognizes the importance of \u201cordi-nary\u201d re-enchantment of everyday life, and the active role of the customer in the creation of the re-enchanted experience. Let us try to develop a framework in which to conceptualize retail re-enchantment with the same terms as the re-enchantment of consumption.\nLet us \ufb01rst consider the visit to a store as an experience, i.e., an interaction between the \ncustomer and the store, that creates a set of utilities tied into forming store value: a func-tional value (the evaluation of the capability of the store to ful\ufb01ll the functional expectations of the customer in terms of product availability, price, and time spent), and an immersion value (the evaluation of the hedonic, symbolic, and social bene\ufb01ts provided by the visit to", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3548, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36851bf6-a0c4-443a-bf08-9db17942e7ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "36851bf6-a0c4-443a-bf08-9db17942e7ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a4daa56-faf1-4970-8961-a7f0c0f9a551", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "54733b56d6c32956e34ec33e22e43e10b046b543f3f276da4861c3cf3e3ce30d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21bee73f-014a-4a40-898b-53c82cd9cbb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "cd35a7c1595e4e46d92c7964a9172eb898f191211bb046dc30f3464650e6edce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a185cc3c-29df-4980-b4d1-65b5875398cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68df229e5411201e02cd32ff4c7b3d505f369bf8470ab00466ad54d647afce00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "BADOT AND FILSER\nn 168the store). Every shopping experience can be positioned on a continuum between mostly \n\u201cfunctional\u201d and mostly \u201cimmersive\u201d shopping experiences. This continuum will provide the \ufb01rst dimension of our descriptive model.\nThe second dimension will describe the contrast between ordinary and extraordinary \nre-enchantment. Ordinary re-enchantment is the creation of value through a combination of minimal sources of personal grati\ufb01cation; more speci\ufb01cally, through the active behavior of the consumer which is conceptualized as \u201ceveryday re-enchantment.\u201d Extraordinary re-enchantment, on the other hand, is mostly the output of a combination of resources designed by the retailer to create a spectacular shopping experience, \u201cmoments of magic\u201d (Gottdiener, 1998), through the manipulation of stimulating and complex environmental sources (such as megamalls or \ufb02agship stores such as Nike T own).\nThe implementation of re-enchantment strategies by retailers focuses primarily on the \nimmersive\u2013extraordinary combination (T able 12.1). Visiting the retail settings competes with other purely leisurely activities, such as a visit to a theme park or a cruise in the Carib-bean. T o be successful, this strategy requires two conditions:\nn the experience has to be very extraordinary, i.e., provide a unique combination of \nstimulations, usually linked with a very costly and lasting investment in order to \nmaintain the mystic and lure of the retail outlet;\nn the trading area of the outlet has to be extremely large (consider, for instance, the \nchoice of Minneapolis for the location of Mall of America, to attract every potential visitor in the United States, or the vicinity of Disneyland Paris and the Val d\u2019Europe shopping mall). Consequently, every national market may sustain a limited number of such outlets if the primary objective is to make money with the outlet. Otherwise, the outlet must be conceived as a way of promoting the image of the brand, in the tradition \nn Table 12.1 A typology of forms for retail re-enchantment\nOrdinary experiences Extraordinary \nexperiences\nFunctional store value Bargain at a discount \nstore\nEconomic valueStimulation, positive surpriseExample: special price promotions in a hard discount storeTheatricalization of store assortmentHedonic valueEsthetic stimulation\nExample: factory outlet, \nthematic animation in a hypermarket\n\u201cImmersive\u201d store value Social routines at a street \ncorner storeStimulation through the visit of the marketplaceSocial interactionsMultisensory stimulationExample: market squareHyper-reality\nHyper- and esthetic \nstimulationSocial interactionsEscapism, \ufb02owExample: megamall, \ufb02agship store", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2675, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a185cc3c-29df-4980-b4d1-65b5875398cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a185cc3c-29df-4980-b4d1-65b5875398cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44f952df-2e10-4e39-9fea-90c7db14ba18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "33b719784552923395a3a63901fa9dc60085cc3f2c80e3d092275e5221378f93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36851bf6-a0c4-443a-bf08-9db17942e7ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "54733b56d6c32956e34ec33e22e43e10b046b543f3f276da4861c3cf3e3ce30d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b681552a-8599-4ea6-92f3-eef454393e9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62c62d2b3e42a6642e1e74742bd60b37b9022ca4d02af00c3e6f465eb387583e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "RE-ENCHANTMENT OF RETAILING\n169 nof the \u201c\ufb02agship stores\u201d created by the pioneers of department store chains at the end \nof the nineteenth century (Williams, 1982).\nA parallel may be drawn with the old \u201cwheel of retailing\u201d theory. According to this \ntheory, innovating retail formats rely on a unique combination of attributes to develop a cost advantage over their competitors and provide a signi\ufb01cant price differential to customers (intertype competition). If the new format is successful, imitators enter the market, and intratype competition becomes the driving force behind retail strategies. According to the wheel principle, competitors try to maintain their position by incorporating new bene\ufb01ts in their offerings: more comfortable amenities, broader assortment, and new services. This upgrading of offerings leads to an increase in margins, and higher prices, creating an op-portunity for less expensive and more price-sensitive formats in the marketplace. The wheel model has proven relatively reliable in the long run, explaining the impact of upgrading orig-inally low-priced formats. T urning back to our model of re-enchantment, we may observe that upgrading a format most often relies on attempts to provide extraordinary experiences in a nondescript shopping environment. And following the theory of neo-institutionalism, as all competitors tend to implement the same strategy, no lasting competitive advantage can be derived. A managerial orientation can be derived from this analysis: rather than upgrading their offerings in an effort to provide potentially unwanted extraordinary retail experiences, retailers may bene\ufb01t from an increased focus on their core functional positioning.\nFinally, managers should keep in mind an important aspect of the proposed model of retail \nre-enchantment. The academic literature in marketing places a major focus on the creation of valuable experiences for the customer through the manipulation of all the components of the retailing mix. The literature in the sociology of consumption, on the other hand, consid-ers that most consumption experiences are constructed, or at least co-constructed, by the customer, through a process of appropriation, most notably in retailing environments. This difference in perspective suggests that re-enchantment is pushed not only by the supply side of the strategy, but also by the retailer, who must leave enough autonomy to the customer to build his/her own experience through the manipulation of stimuli in the shopping environ-ment. For instance, the ability to explore a largely unorganized supply of products, to switch from one store to another, and the challenge created by the search for the unexpected bargain are all identi\ufb01ed as key factors attracting customers to factory outlets.\nRe-enchantment has been narrowly linked with an experiential marketing strategy, and \nviewed as the output of a massive investment on the part of the retailer in speci\ufb01c marketing assets. Considering the contributions of important research \ufb01elds such as consumer behav-ior and the sociology of consumption, we suggest broadening the experiential perspective to incorporate low-key experiences, speci\ufb01cally those experiences co-constructed by the customers themselves.\nCONSPICUOUS VS. \u201cSTREET CORNER\u201d  \nRE-ENCHANTMENT\nIn both professional and academic literature, as well as through common sense, re-enchant-\nment deals very often with some extraordinary experiences: the way it is implemented has to", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b681552a-8599-4ea6-92f3-eef454393e9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b681552a-8599-4ea6-92f3-eef454393e9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3109c0e-a496-4038-8c2e-8b380b544ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "e833ad8b24f85d89039ae86bf958448796c420a9b9c62f7382eb4e31acdc397a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a185cc3c-29df-4980-b4d1-65b5875398cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "8a79291143610fe49e791820e58260ad8f5665a6408c2157b799172942bfd645", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "84c6771a-a4d7-4c30-9827-b5ba242ba638", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5de296561e5f956d31ee72c40d3b54e99e842ba16edfa6481db97dd80d14a976", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "BADOT AND FILSER\nn 170be original, priceless, memorable, unforgettable . . . and the sites considered as examples of \nsuch strategies are huge and spectacular: Disneyland, Nike T own, Mall of America, etc. Re-enchantment is a way to \u201cturn ordinary products into extraordinary experiences\u201d to para-phrase the subtitle of the book Priceless by LaSalle and Britton (2003). This \u201cconspicuous\u201d \norientation (in Veblen tradition) is both a risk for retail managers and limited in scope.\nThe risk is to overposition the retail concept; by relying more on a uniquely original \nstore design than on the whole retailing mix (and to increase the risk of obsolescence and of cognitive dissonance); by using the design of a \ufb02agship store as a template for all subsequent expansion, etc. Recent failures or critical cases (e.g., Dive!, Steven Spielberg\u2019s restaurant chain; Planet Hollywood) prove how re-enchanting stores or restaurants cannot rely only on partial and spectacular attributes and ignore the basic principles of marketing (environmen-tal constraints, nature of the competition, marketing strategy, positioning, targeting, mix). Furthermore, less value is created today by products providing patrons with clues expressing a social status than by experiences increasing the level of esteem of their peers and family (Holbrook, 1999). Even the upper classes are now highly in\ufb02uenced by the symbols of everyday life, and by the street and work culture (Von Dutch, Hummer, Caterpillar, etc.), in other words, by the \u201cstreet corner society,\u201d a kind of reverse process of the Simmel trickle-down theory.\nIn terms of insights, this one-track orientation of re-enchantment does not allow, for \nexample, an explanation for the success of hard discount retailing in industrialized markets (Aldi, Costco, Giant Tiger and . . ., to a certain extent, Wal-Mart). The tremendous success of this format, most notably in food retailing, but increasingly in other product categories, usually exhibits two attributes: low prices and an ef\ufb01cient use of time, the result of a limited assortment. The widening of the concept of re-enchantment suggests a less intuitive bene\ufb01t provided by this format: hard discount stores may provide a psychological bene\ufb01t to the cus-tomer by offsetting the risk of buying a useless product on impulse and the risk of paying too high a price.

On the other hand, there is the conspicuous/street corner axis that positions on its conspicuous sides those strategies that emphasize the spectacular and the extraordinary, while positioning on its other, street corner, side those strategies that are rooted in the microevents constituting our daily lives. The four strategies are the following:\nn Strategy 1 (non-contingent and conspicuous): re-enchantment is an entrepreneurial \nact to promote the brand (e.g., Nike) or the site (e.g., Mall of America) more or \nless independently from the demand needs or desires.

Amazingly, very few analysts cite other reasons to justify Wal-Mart\u2019s success, for example the marketing concept, the imagery of its stores, or the shopping experience.\nIf the shopping experience at Wal-Mart is clearly understated, it is because \nit deals with a very \u201clow-pro\ufb01le imagery\u201d emblematic of both everyday life (neighborhood, popular culture, etc.) and a warehouse mentality far from the ex-altation of re-enchantment. The prestigious and spectacular codes of department stores have been replaced by the symbols of garage, workshop, basement, etc., which promote \u201ctrick and treats\u201d as commercial value (Miller, 1988).\nThe Wal-Mart success seems to be based on four experiences that are tied \ntogether and acted out by the shoppers and narrated by the stores:\n1\n The household composition : the Wal-Mart assortment narrates the house-\nhold composition by the accumulation of simple and colored commodities \n(dry food, basic clothes, and cosmetics, etc.), common products for decora-tion (plastic \ufb02owers, home ornaments, knick-knacks, etc.), and accessories for leisure and hobbies (sports, \ufb01shing, handicraft, bricolage, gardening, car tuning, etc.). The shopper access to the store also signi\ufb01es a kind of life cycle going through various stages: seduction (cosmetics and jewel products come \ufb01rst), household (furniture, electronic appliances, decoration, leisure), kids (clothes, toys), pets (food and accessories), and sickness (drugstore). All these products not only stress the stages of life, they serve to promote a calendar of events (Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day, summer time, Halloween, etc.). Clues of the house environment are widespread eve-rywhere in the stores: messy atmosphere of the children\u2019s room, display and decoration of the bedroom, \ufb02yers to promote stationery for family and religious events, frequent repetition of the word \u201chome\u201d on products and merchandising items.

As Sam Walton pleaded, Wal-Mart stores must re\ufb02ect affordability, family, small and . . . fun. This experience is implemented by delivering: (a) a festive and \nfriendly atmosphere in the stores; (b) the oversimpli\ufb01cation of messages \n(see for example the two shopping carts displayed at the front door present-ing a price comparison between Wal-Mart products and those of the clos-est competitor): and (c) a kind of \u201corganized mess\u201d (stock shortage, badly \ufb01xed labeling, torn promotional materials, etc.), which projects a low-price image consistent with the banner positioning.\n3\n The promotion of ordinary people : this third experience is tied to the previ-\nous ones.

Considering these conditions, one may ask which retailers will \ufb01nd a long-term bene\ufb01t in such a strategy. This leads to three major questions.\nWho is the target of the re-enchantment strategy?\nThe emphasis of most analyses of retail re-enchantment on the supply side of the strategy is \ncontradictory with the importance of the role played by the retail customer for its success. The \ufb01rst part of this chapter showed the critical importance of customer expectations and perceptions in the construction of the retail experience. Several conditions have to be met before a retailer launches a broad-scale re-enchantment strategy:\nn How congruent is the planned re-enchantment process with the present positioning \nof the store? If the retailer is perceived as a low-end discounter, it will hardly be able \nto transform itself to become a major source of escapism and hedonic hyper-reality. The example of the French Carrefour hypermarkets is an illustration of this hurdle; this chain is traditionally perceived by most customers as a convenient and relatively inexpensive place for one-stop shopping. When Carrefour implemented a themed environment in the non-food sections, its price image deteriorated, and meeting expected sales objectives was dif\ufb01cult.\nn Are there enough customers to reach the break-even point of the stores? T oo many \nretailers only keep traf\ufb01c in mind when they are planning retail re-enchantment. A spectacular retail concept may draw customers, but it will be pro\ufb01table only if the conversion rate of the visitors is high enough to reach break-even sales, or if re-enchantment is implemented only in a few key \ufb02agship stores, and is mostly used as a way of improving the image of the other stores.\nn Are the planned locations of the re-enchanted sites congruent with their trading \narea? G\u00e9ant (a French retailer) tested an experimental sophisticated format in a new hypermarket in Roubaix: the economic structure of the trading area of the store was incongruent with such qualitative offerings.\nThese criteria may seem trivial, but a review of major failures of retail re-enchantment \nstrategies underscores their importance.\nHow is the re-enchantment strategy implemented?\nLike any planned positioning, re-enchantment will increase the performance of the stores if \nit is implemented correctly.

The con-gruence between the planned re-enchantment process, the corporate culture of the retailer, and the perceptions of personnel in the stores is critical. A key ingredient of the success of the Nature & D\u00e9couvertes chain in France or Build-a-Bear Workshop in North America is the training of personnel, who play a key role in the creation of the customer experience. Minute details will play a still more critical role in the creation of ordinary shopping experi-ences, in which interactions between customer, store, and staff will be key ingredients in the valuation process.\nA re-enchanted store will need to monitor the perceptions of its customers and the \nef\ufb01ciency of the implementation of its strategic orientations. T raditional benchmarks for customer satisfaction would probably not be relevant, as they tend to capture only the most functionalist dimensions of the store. Indicators derived from the taxonomy of values (Hol-brook, 1999) might be more useful, for instance to embrace the hedonic, esthetic, and sym-bolic components of the shopping experience (extrinsic vs. intrinsic, individual vs. interper-sonal, active vs. reactive). Indicators might even be borrowed from hospitality marketing. In their analysis of the experience economy, Pine and Gilmore (1998) have already mentioned this option. T ools measuring the perceived value of a hospitality experience might improve the monitoring process of a re-enchantment strategy.\nHow sustainable is the re-enchantment strategy of the retailer?\nT wo alternative views have to be considered to address the question of the sustainability of \nthe re-enchantment strategy:\nn Creating re-enchantment can be part of a promotional strategy. A brand (either \nproducer or retailer) aims to position itself using a combination of mostly symbolic \nattributes. This positioning can be communicated through theatricalization of the attributes of the brand in a retail setting. Nike T own is a prototypical example of such a strategy, where the stores are designed not as much to sell products as they are to tell a narrative about the brand and its values. Historical \ufb02agship department stores played a somewhat similar role: they were points of purchase, but they were mostly designed as vectors of the positioning of the chain, valuing the image of the locations of the chain in much less spectacular settings. Flagships such as Printemps and Galeries Lafayette in the Haussmann district of Paris are important stores in terms of both sales and the creation of image for all the provincial branches of these chains. It may even be suggested that, in some cases, \ufb02agship stores can be primarily perceived as pure sources of satisfaction for the ego of the retailer him/herself. In this perspective, re-enchantment is more a part of the promotional strategy and may be sustained as long as the pro\ufb01tability of the investment in the store medium is higher than the investments in more traditional mass media. Interestingly enough, product brands recognize the potential communicating power of stores and include them in their own promotional strategy (Pine and Gilmore, 1998).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3339, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2732aa4d-91d0-4190-b304-602b6e2f7710": {"__data__": {"id_": "2732aa4d-91d0-4190-b304-602b6e2f7710", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "907c5ded-942a-4ba7-88c5-43a55af2306b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "cf9165c40fa9895bcb5db73bc38b079cde8e093997fbeead5fb15ca5dd8c7c3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05d51323-fe73-4a20-925a-50e1b9d8c5ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "a7b7c59f92005c66601548b5bd3e73a36fceeb85bcd23230e3ffef6f716d6ddb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8c3fe9e-fda3-48f4-b642-af9cb9f5068c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "05fd328064a651a83df580ed33c380c41a2c9de770f1460bfe3782c4c877ca5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "BADOT AND FILSER\nn 176n Creating re-enchantment can be the core of a pure retailing strategy. The store design \ntargets a customer segment that values a combination of retailing and entertainment, \nand purchasing in this store is an experience the customer is ready to pay for. We have already discussed the problems an established retailer will face to convert traditional functional retailing into experiential retailing. Similarly, few experiments combining retailing and entertainment have turned pro\ufb01table. However, retailing is considered by social planners as a key ingredient to re-enchant public spaces: to revitalize decaying downtown areas, to provide entertainment to the high volume of visitors in ventral stations or motorway service areas \u2013 even to enrich the cultural experience in museums through gift shops and cafeterias . . .. We need to address this question in radically new terms: What is the role of retailing in the contemporary culture? What innovative retailing formats can be designed to capitalize on emerging trends?\nMALLS OF THE FUTURE: TOWARD UTOPIAN ISLANDS \nAND A NEW DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SITES\nContrary to what Max Weber believed, the rationalization of our society has not led to the \nend of the religious and to disenchantment but, rather, the utopian has reappeared in the form of a symbolic supermarket, a metaphor where everyone circulates and \ufb01lls up his shop-ping cart according to his/her needs and desires. The marketplace in general, and malls in particular, are becoming a theater where consumers can create their own world and fantasize and deliver their parts in a play; retailers provide the staging, props, lighting, etc. In order to give meaning to one\u2019s life, individuals seek sacred, everyday objects and places (Belk et al., 1989), which represent important turning points in western religious history (DeChant, 2002). If, according to the analysts of the \u201cpuzzling religions,\u201d through the centuries, beliefs have been sucked up by the preoccupation with the other world, within the contemporary universe, this obsessive concern for the great beyond seems destined to disappear. T oday, religion is of interest only if it \u201cbrings good,\u201d even if it can manifestly be experienced by each individual in different aspects of his/her life on earth. As such, malls are safe, habitable, and serve as a substitute for the medieval church.\nWest Edmonton Mall, for instance, brings together numerous stimulations and strange \nmethods setting its visitors in a state of identity construction/questioning, thus fully partici-pating in one\u2019s psychic life through a succession of symbolization of world experiences. As well, visitors participate in the partial failures of both these symbolizations which permit the simultaneous construction of his/her inner life and the links binding one to people and things. Utopia at the West Edmonton Mall consists then of an immanent phenomenon aim-ing to harmonize an individual\u2019s collective attitudes and behaviors with seeking to integrate them within the socioeconomic order by founding a common culture (DeChant, 2002). T oday, this function is \ufb01lled, in the west, by consumption that would structure lifestyles, shape an independent culture, and signal the sacred dimensions of existence. By the way, more and more customers are becoming \u201cevangelists\u201d \u2013 religious believers roaming the backstreets of the world spreading the world with their faith \u2013 who share and spread, not love, but products and banners (such as Build-a-Bear Workshop or Krispy Kreme).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8c3fe9e-fda3-48f4-b642-af9cb9f5068c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8c3fe9e-fda3-48f4-b642-af9cb9f5068c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "240771e1-0a1e-49f7-83be-e3085bcbc481", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "bbbe29a487445daa7b63ba14de8083983e45c3fdf82abfc0179703388eed42b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2732aa4d-91d0-4190-b304-602b6e2f7710", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "cf9165c40fa9895bcb5db73bc38b079cde8e093997fbeead5fb15ca5dd8c7c3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca23cc9f-0dd0-4fa8-8488-00d1e8172dcd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ceb971de2cb2549a7662cded0210f2b1596b390ad7625cf93d42ad5b5fd9f08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "RE-ENCHANTMENT OF RETAILING\n177 nWith so many boutiques, stores, restaurants, with schools, housing resorts, of\ufb01ces, \nstreets, avenues, amusement areas . . ., with so numerous entertaining and projective ex-\nperiences . . ., with so many employees, visitors, shoppers, etc., these new malls tend to materialize a new kind of bright future . . . in \u201cutopian islands,\u201d a format close to the \u201ccave planets\u201d imagined in the 1970s by the French futurologists (Gaudin, 1993).

These \u201cislands\u201d would be oriented to a prophylactic society of hedonic and spiritual value as well as leisure and friend-liness, full of simulacra, where the ideas of fear and death will be absent (Figure 12.2).\nAll this shows to what extent the current evolutions of various public sites (shopping \nareas, amusement parks, cultural and sacred sites such as museum and churches, or tourist locations) tend to lead to a common hybrid pattern close to the previous utopian projec-tions. This new pattern of public sites addresses a mythology aligned with the postmodern imaginaries highly irrigated by an ethic of esthetic.\nn Figure 12.2 \u201cUtopian Islands\u201d as a hybrid pattern of public sites.\nCultural\nand Sacred\nSitesShopping\nMallsAmusement\nParks\nTourist\nLocationsUtopian\nIslands", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca23cc9f-0dd0-4fa8-8488-00d1e8172dcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca23cc9f-0dd0-4fa8-8488-00d1e8172dcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a14102e-9b8b-40b8-ac1c-096842b32b5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "c01c1f5a59b17f3eff48f6a56a24d603a01ac0c88f28fa15aee21260fc0addce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8c3fe9e-fda3-48f4-b642-af9cb9f5068c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "bbbe29a487445daa7b63ba14de8083983e45c3fdf82abfc0179703388eed42b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f268ac21-26c2-440f-a6e3-bae8bd013114", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffe4583cecc5abacf9f2d98b20f131511d574448a3ef98a8ef4fe62c803fc2b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "BADOT AND FILSER\nn 178CASE VIGNETTE 12.2: MADRID XANADU, THE \nEXAMPLE OF A UTOPIAN ISLAND\nLying southwest of Madrid, the Madrid Xanadu mall, which was built in 2003 \nalong retailtainment  lines, is quite different from other shopping and leisure \ncenters. Its architecture, spatial layout, and artistic decors were designed in such a way as to assure consumers a true experience. Visitors here are captivated by an unusual environment involving a perfect marriage between shopping and fun. This is the only place in the world where consumers can stroll past 150 shops yet \ufb01nd family entertainment activities such as go-karting as well as nightclubs, merry-go-rounds, and even ski slopes! Indeed, one way Xanadu gives its visitors a sense of the exotic is by offering them (through a simple entrance such as they would \ufb01nd at a movie theater in a restaurant and fast food district)\n an Alpine ski \nexperience with all of the associated sensations: cold, snow, ski-tow, chair lifts, slopes, etc. In short, Xanadu appears to be a good (albeit incomplete) illustration of the utopian islands model. These are places characterized by the hybridization of shopping centers, tourist spots, amusement parks, and holy sites:\nv With its 150 shops, large department store (Corte Ingles), restaurants, and \nfast food stands, Xanadu is one of Madrid\u2019s leading customer locations.\nv Xanadu is a real tourist spot and actually constitutes Spain\u2019s leading ski \nresort south of Madrid (the country\u2019s main mountains being located to the \nnorth of the city). Like its northern rivals, it attracts visitors in both sum-mer and winter. More precisely, it is visited in wintertime by skiers from south of Madrid and in summertime by everyone. A ski resort experience is created all year long in an atmosphere replete with chalet dining hall (with a grate even in the middle of summer), equipment rentals (anoraks, snow \nboots, gloves, etc.), sensorial stimulations (light, temperature, etc.), and experienced skiers traipsing around carrying skis on their shoulders.\nv Xanadu is also an amusement park. It may be primarily positioned (in ex-\nternal and internal design terms) as a standard shopping center cum ski resort, but it is also an amusement park that attracts children (with its luna-park, re-enchanted day nurseries, children-oriented thematized events, and many Disney Village-style restaurants).\nv Xanadu resembles a holy site (even if this dimension is less obvious than \nthe three mentioned above). There are religious connotations to Xanadu\u2019s architecture (Figure 12.3). Developed by a well-known US company (the Mills Corporation) that has already promoted a slew of shopping centers in North America, this cultural variable (Spain\u2019s age-old Catholic tradi-tion) probably offers the best explanation for the sacred overtones of the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2825, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f268ac21-26c2-440f-a6e3-bae8bd013114": {"__data__": {"id_": "f268ac21-26c2-440f-a6e3-bae8bd013114", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a023af10-1bbb-4d86-b2d5-7581b3f49b10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "288532732227408e3f6c1b05f3c60335cf40daefcd424a502a82f63d8947e08d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca23cc9f-0dd0-4fa8-8488-00d1e8172dcd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "501b9b815faaad56c62111c624b54a916164437ebfc65a58aca05af95b583418", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba2a31af-42b0-4c22-a5d0-c48f9ba5ad98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cda1d2cc6ff533d420a4b1b37bffe212ff3d70373237cf5c8458be373c8a831", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "RE-ENCHANTMENT OF RETAILING\n179 nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nn What distinguishes re-enchantment with a product/service offer from experiential \nmarketing?\nn Does experiential marketing necessarily have to be spectacular in nature?\nn Describe the elements of the mix that can be used to help people have a hard \ndiscount experience.\nn Which brakes and levers can a retailer use to implement an experiential \nstrategy?\nn Based on the utopian island construct, draw a mall for the year 2025.n Figure 12.3 Xanadu Madrid.\narchitectural choices that have been made at Xanadu.

Arnould\nORIENTING THOUGHTS\nA period of opportune crisis appears to be unfolding across the marketing \ufb01eld, with schol-\nars from many countries proposing fundamental paradigmatic-level reorientations of either local or more general applicability. Critical marketing, Mediterranean marketing, consumer culture theory, multisensory marketing, and the evolving service-dominant logic are among the labels applied to these theorizing tendencies. Important among them is the experiential marketing framework.\nThe experiential marketing framework claims adherents across national boundaries, \nacross methodological orientations, and among practitioners and consultants (Pine and Gilmore, 1999; Schmitt, 1999), as well as theoreticians. Further, it appears to incorporate a number of elements from a relatively long period of conceptualization into a potentially fruitful way of approaching today\u2019s rapidly evolving marketspaces.\nWhat all of these tendencies, of which the experiential marketing prospective is one of \nthe most fruitful, have in common is an assertion of the co-creative role of what have tra-ditionally been called consumers in the production of commercial outcomes. As Vargo and Lusch (2004) now argue, marketers mobilize operand (tangible things such as products and servicescapes) and operant (intangible things such as core competences and brand images) KEY POINTS\nn Marketspace is defined by the interaction of marketers who offer and \nconsumers who extract value in use from marketers\u2019 value propositions.\nn Experiences may be redefined in terms of a fourfold performance space.\nn Experiences are both substantively and communicatively staged.\nn Consumers extract value from experiences through narrative frames and \ndevices.\nn The experiential framework calls into question the continued scientific \nvalue of the consumption and consumer constructs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1937, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c3bec30-fb65-444c-8162-f8cedc963588": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c3bec30-fb65-444c-8162-f8cedc963588", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc5a68a4-cf9a-4707-ae12-1bda469aa67f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "da48f053abdaf6fb45573a7723121f6a31405de5e2d930f7a23dcddd388c1e4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9beb84f6-8ba4-4eb0-8e43-18f5a6ffa967", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "04982e46b6f0230139a6936ec3a44af02e26bb2f71892bbc1dd739ff857455b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1811d74d-7686-4135-ab06-a98bfac915d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d052d2ff977ad5f3c0218588c94e74e9c76ec6f2fd0852a06de7ff732e64bb30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ARNOULD\nn 186resources to deliver offerings into marketspace. And, indeed, that is all that marketers can \ndo. They cannot induce satisfaction, loyalty, or perceived value in the targets of their market-ing efforts. In fact, Vargo and Lusch argue that the marketing process is completed only if and when consumers mobilize their own operant and operand resources to avail themselves of the services that \ufb01rms\u2019 market offerings propose, and extract value-in-use from these services. For example, sports brands provide a potential range of services to consumers: ranging from improved performance or safety to identi\ufb01cation with the image of the ce-lebrity sports spokesperson whose persona is associated with the brand (McCracken, 1989; Codeluppi, Chapter 11 in this volume). Through performances ranging from skillful execu-tion of a basketball jump shot to being seen in the right place, at the right time, and with the right relevant others, the consumer extracts the value-in-use delivered by this service. We have diagrammed this conception (Arnould et al., 2006) in which co-production is the \nexperiential marketspace (Figure 13.1).\nThe point of this is that consumer experience may be thought of as the outcome of the \nvalue extraction processes in which consumer engage, a proposition amply demonstrated across the cases reported in this volume. In the remainder of this brief contribution, I want to highlight what I think of as some organizing concepts for a fully developed consumer-centric notion of experience and bring in a few elements that may enrich future discussions this book will surely animate. In this regard, I want to discuss the performance metaphor, two important performative modalities, press the issue of how it is that consumers appro-priate commercial experience, and then, \ufb01nally, end with a conceptual question, does the experiential metaphor mean that we have reached the end of the useful life of the consumer construct?\nTHE PERFORMANCE METAPHOR\nI would like to suggest the enduring and still relatively underused value of the performance metaphor in discussions of experiential marketing.

In fact, foreshadowing Vargo and Lusch (2004), Deighton (1992) argues that performance or purposive action is a necessary condition that gives rise to all consumption experience. In other words, consumers behave as if they were audi-ences responding to or participating in performances with products, services, retail envi-ronments, and commercially staged experiences. A consumption performance assumes a plot-like form; importantly, therefore, it has a narrative dimension, involving anticipation, tension, and resolution; it has a rhetorical purpose and enlists participants in the action. All performance takes places in space and over time.\nDrawing on a diverse literature, Deighton developed a still useful typology of consumer \nperformances differentiated by the extent to which consumers play a passive consumer or active co-constructive prosumerist role in the performance, and whether the performance takes place in a naturalistic, realistic setting, or an arti\ufb01cial, fantastic setting (Figure 13.2).\nSkill performance is the staged display of competence in a naturalistic setting for the \nbene\ufb01t of a passive observer, as exempli\ufb01ed in the professional service provision of lawyers and accountants for instance. In this volume, the charming description of Italian youth discovering the commensal pleasures of cooking pasta for guests (see Dalli and Romani, Chapter 5 in this volume) documents the process of developing a skill performance. This depiction implies that marketers might usefully develop communications with young Italians anxious to acquire or improve their skills in pasta-based meal production.\nThrill performance refers to the active participation by the consumer in naturalistic \nn Figure 13.2 Classifying consumer performances (adapted from Deighton 1992; \nStamps and Arnould 1998).\nPassive\nconsumerActiveconsumerRealistic\nenvironment\nFantastic\nenvironmentSkillPerformance,e.g., chess, jury trial,golf, pasta makingThrillPerformance,e.g., trekking, sky-diving, white water\nrafting, battle re-enactment\nShow\nPerformance,e.g., Ligabue concertopera, theater,\nbeauty pageantFestive\nPerformance,e.g., Carcavegia,Burning man,\ncarnivalSkill-Show\nHybrid ,e . g . ,\nedutainment,night time\nin-line skating\nShow-Festive\nHybrid ,e . g . ,\nFlorida\nClassic", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2445, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97f221da-ae5c-4605-ac87-c453cb85c16d": {"__data__": {"id_": "97f221da-ae5c-4605-ac87-c453cb85c16d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bb66bdf-3038-4d1b-885a-8625ba0640f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "bab0e13356d1fe8b7653cfb31addd993709a2603c1543e0e6208d530f2a5f089", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1811d74d-7686-4135-ab06-a98bfac915d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "999fcc38c6f29ef70e0c3be54bd4aeea5682d7293b36f34807f673a72b20fdc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a98673d2-1968-4116-9c36-8290d04ba28c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ec31c5642a5b6ed916f6f9e6fd2ce2a3ebc9342d4e6d363edc181cd4d0f06cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ARNOULD\nn 188activity in which the staging, while present, is not intrusive. Ladwein (Chapter 7 in this \nvolume) discussed an example of a thrill performance, adventure trekking.\nA show performance has elements of spectacle: extravagant display, separation of audi-\nence and performers, and rhetorical ampli\ufb01cation of moral values (DeBord, 1994/1977; Firat and Venkatesh, 1995). Show performances incorporate rich, complex visual images and environments that convey cultural meanings that consumers/participants understand. Further, interest lies not with the outcome, but in the process. The action that unfolds at the utopian retail islands described by Badot and Filser (Chapter 12 in this volume) and Ligabue\u2019s rock concerts described by Santoro and T roilo (Chapter 8 in this volume) are two diverse examples of show performances. The Live 8 global concert series for African aid in 2005 provides an excellent illustration as well.\nIn festival performances, events unfold in a fairly ritualistic and predictable manner \nwithin relatively narrow limits, retaining the arti\ufb01ciality of staging characteristic of show performances. Nevertheless, festival-like events allow for more interchange in the roles of audience and performer, and exhibit multiple, rather than singular, foci of action and atten-tion. Ligabue\u2019s unplugged performances, as described by Santoro and T roilo (Chapter 8 in this volume), are perhaps an example. However, the most striking examples in this volume are found in Chapter 2 by Sherry, Kozinets, and Borghini, where descriptions of a variety of \ufb01re-based ritual festivals in North America and Italy draw attention to the role of prosump-tion ritual and sacri\ufb01ce. Indeed, all of the festive performance rituals they discuss \u2013 Burning Man, Carcavegia, the Ducati motorcycle, and custom automobile \u2013 involve \ufb01re (external and internal \ufb01res respectively). Insofar as many theorists argue that ritual, and especially sacri\ufb01ce, is at the origin of culture itself (Miller, 1998), the fascination of such festive performances is not hard to understand. Hence, when consumers are investing in such rituals, they are no longer acting as consumers, those who consume resources that others are providing. In fact, they are acting as protagonists, producers of narrative, historical, and cultural resources, as indeed Sherry et al. intimate (Chapter 2 in this volume).\nThis fourfold classi\ufb01cation admits of hybrid forms, as Stamps and Arnould (1998) dis-\ncuss in describing the Florida Classic show-festive performance. The night-time skating activities of the Parisian inline skaters described by Cova and Cova (2001) could similarly be reinterpreted as hybrid skill\u2013show performances. In this volume, we might well conceive of edutainment discussed by Podest\u00e0 and Addis in Chapter 10 as a hybrid performative form combining elements of skill and show performances.\nThe point of classi\ufb01catory schemes such as Deighton\u2019s is twofold. First, it helps us sort \nout the myriad forms of experiential consumption into meaningful groups. Second, it sug-gests the kinds of interventions that marketers may undertake to increase the value people derive from commercial experiences. Thus, in experiences in which consumers take an active role, marketers must play a background, supportive role, as apparently have some of the skating companies in Cova and Cova\u2019s (2001) example. If they attempt to overproduce, direct, or control experiences, participants will reject them. Stamps and Arnould (1998) refer to a major gaffe in this regard by a local retail mall.

We can think of commercial landscapes or marketspaces as contingent, interlocking outcomes of the deployment of managerial strategies and consumer resources and inputs. As argued elsewhere (Arnould et al., 1998), commercial landscapes are produced through both substantive and communicative staging, and we can \ufb01nd high or low levels of substantive staging combined with either high or low levels of communicative staging, thus producing another fourfold classi\ufb01catory model. Substantive staging refers to the physical creation of contrived environments, a marketer-controlled operand resource. Santoro and T roilo (Chapter 8 in this volume) detail many elements of the substantive stag-ing that provides raw material for the experiences consumers derive from Ligabue concerts. Similarly, Badot and Filser (Chapter 12 in this volume) dwell on the substantive staging of utopian malls, divining elements that are needed to create these performance spaces. Fi-nally, Hetzel (Chapter 9 in this volume) describes the clever substantive staging of Miyake\u2019s A-POC brand in fashion shows, retail venues, and, indeed, on Miyake\u2019s Internet sites, show-ing how substantive staging may become a multichannel affair. Even servicescapes that em-phasize authenticity ranging from zoological \ufb02ight cages and safari parks to Caribbean scuba diving-oriented resorts are contrived, as Ladwein (Chapter 7 in this volume) points out in the context of trekking adventures.\nThe authors in this volume dwell far less than one might like on the communicative \nstaging of consumer experiences, an operant resource. Communicative staging refers to ways in which the environment is presented and interpreted by commercial service pro-viders or by consumer adepts and experts who become implicit or explicit confederates of marketers. Communicative staging involves the transmission of experiential meanings, both those directly related to the delivery of commercial offerings and those transcending the instrumental context. Communicative staging moves meanings from commercial land-scapes through service providers to customer, between customers, and, potentially at least, from customers to providers. Communicative staging is patterned through the who, what, how, and when of communication. And it requires the active participation of both service providers and clients; and as suggested in the Santoro and T roilo and Sherry, Kozinets, and Borghini chapters (Chapters 8 and 2 in this volume respectively), communicative staging relies for its effectiveness on a mutuality of cultural understandings.\nT o illustrate, servicescapes typically use at least some substantive staging, and may com-\nbine that with either high or low levels of communicative staging. For example, a restaurant serving French cuisine may decorate in a manner redolent of Proven\u00e7al life; this is substan-tive staging. It may also print the menu in French, hire French-speaking wait staff, and feature a singer of Edith Piaf songs. This is communicative staging.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9844007-0347-4c9e-84f9-8f8535f8b75c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9844007-0347-4c9e-84f9-8f8535f8b75c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7296a5f9-8d75-4491-a81b-39f5a8ff3628", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "c1ac41ab5fe39c13a27b4e782a32355a5fdeae6db5565d0c37fffb41896c8224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a98673d2-1968-4116-9c36-8290d04ba28c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "data/Chap25.pdf"}, "hash": "485b13fde7131eb3ec9ab8253a4d5b1b4cbb56e9e9493e9ab101d559d0611e03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d13cccc-8d8a-41d8-a2a9-6ec9759c3aac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc860aac557c5fbae6ff13aef25b730626a85707942f3e4e583e4b211d807685", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ARNOULD\nn 190Previous research, like much of the research in this volume, has stressed the substantive \nstaging of the consumer experiences over communicative staging. Y et, servicescapes can be \ndramatically affected by communicative staging. Arnould et al. (1998) showed that, through \ntheir actions and commentaries on the natural environment, white water river guides helped consumers sort their experiences in the \u201csame\u201d landscape into narratives consistent with four different, enduring myths about the American wilderness. They include the view of wild nature as: a transcendental force; a molder of human character; a restorative, healing agency; and as a refuge, whose irreplaceability and complexity makes it essential to conserve and preserve. Ladwein (Chapter 7 in this volume) similarly shows how certain pervasive narrative themes structure trekkers\u2019 experiences, although he does not detail the role of providers in helping consumers structure their experiences narratively. Similarly, Chronis et \nal. (n.d.) show how service providers help consumers reframe their experiences of the his-torical events that unfolded 160 years ago at the Gettysburg Civil War battle\ufb01eld into stories about heroism, redemption, freedom, and patriotic unity. In future research on experiential consumption, we need far more work on the communicative staging of commercial experi-ences if we are to realize the full potential of the experiential marketing framework.\nCONSUMER APPROPRIATION OF EXPERIENCE\nA further issue of great importance is contained in the question: How do consumers derive value from experiences that they variously perform? Ladwein (Chapter 7 in this volume) makes the point that \u201cThe ongoing ambiguity that consists of both soliciting danger yet hoping that the risks are not excessive (or are at least under control) can be grasped via the notion of an \u2018event\u2019 .\u201d Thus, he points to the fact that it is only when consumers narratively bracket out from the relentless \ufb02ow of sensory experience the realization that something is happening that events can become experiences. This is especially likely when consumers experience narrative \u201ctransportation,\u201d or what Car\u00f9 and Cova (Chapter 3 in this volume) term immersion into consumption experience.\nDeighton (1992) furthers the discussion of some of the ways in which consumers de-\nrive experiential value from events. He remarks that commercial providers of experiences provide settings and sanction particular kinds of actions. However, consumer performers must also construct narratives built up from the raw materials provided by commercial providers and their own actions. They do so, as a number of chapters in this volume show, by drawing on their beliefs about human motivation and emotion, upon lay psychology, upon cultural blueprints for action and interpretation such as mythic templates (Holt and Thompson, 2004; Thompson, 2004). Marketers often suggest narrative elements, as in the types of activities substantively staged at ESPN Zone (Kozinets et al., 2004), or the \nthemed restaurants that Deighton describes, but consumers actively create much of the rest. Arnould (2005) suggests that consumers deploy narrative frames that reimagine marketer\u2019s value propositions in terms of consumers\u2019 own life projects. Narrative reframing introduces active consumer agency into the \ufb01rm-supplied resource by associating the consumer\u2019s self, life project, and goals with the \ufb01rm-provided resources.

More speci\ufb01cally, consumers create experiences out of commercial performances by way of several speci\ufb01c narrative devices such as \ufb01lling narrative gaps, recontextualizing, and imagining, processes detailed in Chronis et al.\u2019s (n.d.) \ndiscussion of consumer narrative experiences at the Gettysburg battle\ufb01eld in the USA.\nT o fully understand the value of experiences to consumers and how marketers could \nsuccessfully co-create them with consumers, researchers still need to know a lot more about the different types of consumers\u2019 narrative frames and devices that consumers employ, the operation of transportation or immersion, the ways in which narrative frames and devices facilitate value-adding performances by \ufb01rm-provided resources, and how marketer-pro-vided resources cue consumer narrative practices that turn performances into experiences.\nTHE END OF THE CONSUMER?\nThe authors of this volume are perhaps too wise or too circumspect to say so directly, but it seems to me that adopting an experiential marketing framework calls into question the continued scienti\ufb01c and managerial utility of the consumer construct. For example, Car\u00f9 and Cova (Chapter 3 in this volume) discreetly suggest,\nSelf-determination is rooted in a vision that equates consumers with protagonists, who are traditionally considered to be operating in reaction to something. The idea here is that consumers are trying to be less passive and injecting a personal touch into their consumption experiences. Self-determination is based on the idea of consumers\u2019 active participation in an experience.\nThe key point here is that the \u201cconsumer\u201d has indeed been typically conceived in mar-\nketing as a reactor, someone who responds to the rhetorical blandishments of marketing and advertising. Indeed, this notion of consumers as manipulable reactors is built not only into a lot of management literature, including some of that dealing with experiential marketing (Schmitt, 1999), but also into that literature that ostensibly critiques these practices (e.g., Packard, 1957; Miller, 1998; Schor, 1998; Ewen, 2001). Alternatively, we may follow the experiential logic that Hetzel (Chapter 9 in this volume) expresses,\n. . . experiential marketing has accentuated a new vision of how companies view their customers. The latter are no longer purely thought of as existing at \u201cthe end of the chain\u201d but as fully-\ufb02edged actors with whom the company will try to develop a rela-tionship wherein both parties act as the \u201cco-builders\u201d of what is going to occur.\nIf so, then we must move away from passive constructions of consumer action. This \nmeans, for instance, as Cova and R\u00e9my (Chapter 4 in this volume) point out, that:\nA customer\u2019s \u201cintention to\u201d should be distinguished from the notion of motivation that is so often used in marketing.

For it means that \nconsumers are indeed no longer the \u201cend of the chain\u201d but the beginning of the chain and, further, that the marketers\u2019 goals can play only a role secondary to the intentionality of agen-tic persons. The hoary notion of motivation to achieve psychological balance through need satisfaction is replaced with the proactive goal-oriented notion of intention, thus opening the space for creation and, indeed, transformation through commercial experience. Dalli and Romani (Chapter 5 in this volume) develop this critique quite explicitly. And they take the next step of implicitly asking whether the experiential perspective calls into question the utility of the notion of consumption itself when marketers\u2019 offerings are secondary to the value-in-use that people derive from the services they provide, in their case the emotional, linking value (Cova, 1997) derived from the preparation of pasta:\nthe role of \u201cconsumption\u201d is clearly secondary to that of preparation, in which the conditions are created for the development of an emotional relationship, whose im-portance goes well beyond any material or commercial consideration. That the \u201cprod-uct\u201d then appears to be appreciated by the other players in the situation is completely secondary.\nNow, if we take Dalli and Romani\u2019s point that consumption is now secondary to prepara-\ntion or production, and \u201cpreparation,\u201d \u201cimmersion,\u201d and \u201ctransformation\u201d are privileged outcomes of commercial experience, then how are we to reimagine the actors who instigate commercial experiences? None of the authors in this volume throws down a polemical \ufb01gurative gauntlet on this point, but Cova and R\u00e9my (Chapter 4 in this volume) imply that a new term is needed when they propose:\nwe will be focusing on the experiences of prosumers who take it upon themselves to \nweave realities that are more human, genuine and political, but also less commercial, in nature.\nWhether one chooses \u201cprotagonist,\u201d \u201cconsum\u2019actor,\u201d \u201cprosumer,\u201d or some other neolo-\ngism of choice, the point of these awkward verbal gestures is that the co-creative producer of genuine, political, less commercial experiences is far removed from the passive mass market consumer of the postwar consumerist boom (Cohen, 2003).
