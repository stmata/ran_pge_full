It\u2019s the job of the marketing researcher to produce insight to assist in the marketing man -\nager\u2019s decision making.\nMarketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and public to the marketer \nthrough information used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems; generate, \nrefine, and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; and improve understand -\ning of marketing as a process. Marketing research specifies the information required to address these \nissues, designs the method for collecting information, manages and implements the data collection \nprocess, analyzes the results, and communicates the findings and their implications.\nIMPORTANCE OF MARKETING INSIGHTS\nMarketing research is all about generating insights. Marketing insights provide diagnostic infor -\nmation about how and why we observe certain effects in the marketplace and what that means to \nmarketers.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3492, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f781c34-5922-40f3-9fc8-3084647e0f03": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f781c34-5922-40f3-9fc8-3084647e0f03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba44ac54-8dfa-49ee-8d50-932e578fa32d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "061eb36ee8b84d846f9f135db20f4a296814cd8854786913f315c89ec4d11922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6734b978-2bde-4045-b2ce-f2ad43267140", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "f584bc17a8639b3dc32d612d4c2e3ed9a7821f6699bbd907cd0771824a5d21ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7196e77-961d-4df0-87a6-803ef38bcad6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4213729be58259616d5bae7b33b67dd863679f1f9233baf48f8402599a8ceb19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "100 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nGood marketing insights often form the basis of successful marketing programs. Consider the \nfollowing examples:\nWhen an extensive consumer research study of U.S. retail shoppers by Walmart revealed \nthat the store\u2019s key competitive advantages were the functional benefit of \u201coffers low prices\u201d \nand the emotional benefit of \u201cmakes me feel like a smart shopper,\u201d its marketers used those \ninsights to develop its \u201cSave Money, Live Better\u201d campaign. The new campaign, which \nreplaced the 19-year-old \u201cAlways Low Prices. Always.\u201d slogan, won Walmart a REBRAND \n100 Global Award of distinction and put a positive spin on Walmart\u2019s reputation for \u201ccheap\u201d \nmerchandise, shifting consumers\u2019 focus from prices alone to how shopping at Walmart could \nhelp them attain a better lifestyle.\nWhen marketing research showed that consumers viewed Walgreens largely as a con -\nvenience store with a pharmacy in the back, the company took steps to reposition itself as \na premium health care brand, putting more emphasis on its wellness offerings, such as its \nwalk-in clinics. Three years later, revenue had risen by 14 percent in a sluggish economy.2\nGaining marketing insights is crucial for marketing success. To improve the marketing of \nits $3 billion Pantene hair care brand, Procter & Gamble conducted a deep dive into women\u2019s \nfeelings about hair, using surveys with mood scales from psychology, high-resolution EEG \nresearch to measure brainwaves, and other methods. As a result, the company reformulated \nPantene products, redesigned packages, pared the line down from 14 \u201ccollections\u201d to eight, \nand fine-tuned the ad campaign.3\nIf marketers lack consumer insights, they often get in trouble. When Tropicana redesigned its orange \njuice packaging, dropping the iconic image of an orange skewered by a straw, it failed to adequately test \nfor consumer reactions\u2014with disastrous results. Sales \ndropped by 20 percent, and Tropicana reinstated the old \npackage design after only a few months.4\nIn spite of the rapid growth of marketing research, \nmany companies still fail to use it sufficiently or \n correctly. They may not understand the capabilities of \nmarketing research or may not provide the researcher \nwith a sufficiently specific definition of the problem \nor opportunity that needs to be explored. In addition, \nthey may have unrealistic expectations about what \n researchers can offer. Failure to use marketing research \nproperly has led to numerous gaffes, including the \n following  historic one.\nGeneral Foods.  In the 1970s, a successful market -\ning research executive left General Foods to try a daring \ngambit: bringing market research to Hollywood to give \nfilm studios access to the same research that had spurred \nGeneral Foods\u2019s success. A major film studio handed him \na science fiction film proposal and asked him to research \nand predict its success or failure. His views would inform \nthe studio\u2019s decision about whether to back the film. The \nresearch executive concluded the film would fail. For \none, he argued, Watergate had made the United States \nless trusting of institutions, and as a result, its citizens \nin the 1970s prized realism and authenticity over sci -\nence fiction. This particular film also had the word war \nin its title; the executive reasoned that viewers, suffering \npost-Vietnam hangover, would stay away in droves. The \nfilm was Star Wars , which eventually grossed more than  \n$4.3 billion in box office receipts alone. What this \nresearcher delivered was information and opinion, not \ninsight. He failed to study the script itself, to see that it \nwas a fundamentally human story\u2014of love, conflict, \nloss, and redemption\u2014that happened to play out against \nthe backdrop of space.5>> A marketing researcher whose evaluation of a proposal for \nStar Wars  was based more on opinion than insight gained through  \ncareful research predicted failure for the multibillion-dollar \nblockbuster. \nSource: World History Archive/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7196e77-961d-4df0-87a6-803ef38bcad6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7196e77-961d-4df0-87a6-803ef38bcad6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6215c21-7f84-480c-90eb-ebc8da62397f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "f4527e3d7d606f1e789e93e33fbb427c9b6ec04f554a32739220933273567d43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f781c34-5922-40f3-9fc8-3084647e0f03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "061eb36ee8b84d846f9f135db20f4a296814cd8854786913f315c89ec4d11922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f851f7f-4861-46ec-ac01-1eeea403fd6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71d88fe4377f275353d91c1a01e56154dbad3c1f65595b0c79982a31bac5e8b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 5    |  CoNDUCTING  MARKETING  RESEARCH  101\nWHO DOES MARKETING RESEARCH?\nMost companies use a combination of resources to study their industries, competitors, audiences, and \nchannel strategies. They normally budget marketing research at 1 to 2 percent of company sales and \nspend a large percentage of that on the services of outside firms. In addition, most large companies \nhave their own marketing research departments, which often play crucial roles within the organiza -\ntion. Here is how Procter & Gamble describes its marketing research department.\nProcter & Gamble  The Consumer & Market Knowledge (CMK) Department is Procter & \nGamble\u2019s key internal compass, guiding and championing decisions related to brand and customer \nbusiness development strategy based on in-depth analysis of consumers, shoppers, and the retail \ntrade.

(2) Custom marketing research firms carry out specific projects. (3) Specialty-line \nmarketing research firms provide specialized research services (e.g., a field-service firm that sells field \ninterviewing services to other firms).\nCompanies need not break their budgets to get helpful marketing research data.

Intuit takes all the employ -\nees\u2019 proposed solutions and experiments with them, building products based on the ideas that seem \nto work best.8\nThe Marketing Research Process\nTo take advantage of all the resources and practices available, good marketers adopt a formal market -\ning research process that follows the five steps shown in Figure 5.1. We illustrate these steps in the \nfollowing situation.9\nConsider the marketing research underlying American Airlines\u2019 decision to offer entertainment \noptions on all of its flights, starting with the first-class passengers on long-haul flights. The airline was \nconsidering several options: (1) ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi service, (2) 124 channels of high-definition \nsatellite cable TV, and (3) a personal video entertainment system that lets each passenger have a custom -\nized in-flight experience. The marketing research manager was assigned to investigate how first-class \npassengers would rate ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi, and how much extra they would be willing to pay. One \nsource estimated revenues of $70 million from Wi-Fi access over 10 years if enough business-class \npassengers paid $25. AA could thus recover its costs in a reasonable time, given that making the con -\nnection available would cost $90,000 per plane.\nDEFINING THE PROBLEM\nMarketing managers must be careful not to define the problem too broadly or too narrowly for the \nmarketing researcher. A marketing manager who says, \u201cFind out everything you can about first-class \nair travelers\u2019 needs\u201d will collect a lot of unnecessary information. One who says, \u201cFind out whether \nenough passengers aboard a B777 flying direct between Chicago and Tokyo would pay $25 for ultra-\nhigh-speed Wi-Fi service so we can break even in one year on the cost of offering this service\u201d is taking \ntoo narrow a view of the problem.\nTo broaden and clarify the research parameters, the marketing researcher might ask, \u201cWhy does \nWi-Fi have to be priced at $25 as opposed to $15, $35, or some other price? Why does American have \nto break even on the service, especially if it attracts new customers, who will bring in more revenue?\u201d \nAnother relevant question might be \u201cHow important is it to be first in the market, and how long can \nthe company sustain its lead before competition forces it to drop the price or offer the service free?\u201d \nThese questions focus on the key issues that the manager must address and, at the same time, are \nspecific enough to be actionable.\nThe marketing manager ultimately defines the business question as follows: \u201cWill offering high-\nspeed Wi-Fi service create enough incremental preference and profit to justify its cost against other \nservice enhancements American might make?\u201d This question can be broken down into several sub-\nquestions: (1) Should American offer high-speed Wi-Fi service? (2) If so, should it be offered to first-\nclass only or include business class and possibly economy class? (3) What price(s) should be charged? \n(4) On what types of planes and lengths of trips should the service be offered?\nNext, the manager can translate the business questions into specific research objectives: \n(1)\u00a0Determine what types of first-class passengers would respond most to ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi \nservice. (2) Ascertain how many are likely to use it at different price levels. (3) Find out how many \nmight choose American because of this new service. (4) Estimate how much long-term goodwill \nthis service will add to American\u2019s image. (5) Find out how important ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi \nservice is to first-class passengers relative to other services, such as a power plug or enhanced \nentertainment.\nMarketing research varies with the type of information it aims to generate.

Suppose American made a prior \nestimate that launching ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi service would yield a long-term profit of $50,000. If \nthe manager believes the marketing research will lead to an improved pricing and promotional plan \nand a long-term profit of $90,000, he should be willing to spend up to $40,000 on this research. If the \nresearch will cost more than $40,000, it\u2019s not worth doing. The cost of the market research should be \nin line with its estimated benefits.\nTo design a research plan, we need to make decisions about the data sources, research approaches, \nresearch instruments, sampling plan, and contact methods.\nData Sources.  The researcher can gather secondary data, primary data, or both. Secondary data  \nare data that were collected for another purpose and already exist somewhere. Primary data  are data \nfreshly gathered for a specific purpose or project.\nAfter determining the type of data, researchers usually start their investigation by examining \nwhether some of the data that the company has already collected can be useful in addressing the \nresearch question. The next step involves utilizing the rich variety of low-cost and readily available \nsecondary data from outside sources to partly or wholly solve the problem without collecting costly \nprimary data. For instance, auto advertisers looking to get a better return on their online car ads might \npurchase a copy of a J.D. Power and Associates survey that gives insights into who buys specific brands \nand where advertisers can find them online.\nWhen the needed data do not exist or are dated or unreliable, the researcher will need to collect \nprimary data. Most marketing research projects do include some collection of primary data.\nResearch Approaches.  Marketers collect primary data in five main ways: through observation, \nfocus groups, surveys, behavioral data, and experiments.\nObservational Research.  With observational research , researchers can gather fresh data by \nobserving unobtrusively as customers shop or consume products. Sometimes researchers equip con -\nsumers with pagers and instruct them to write down or text what they\u2019re doing whenever prompted, \nor they hold informal interview sessions at a caf\u00e9 or bar.10 Photographs and videos can also provide \na wealth of detailed information. Although privacy concerns have been expressed, some retailers are \nlinking security cameras with software to record shopper behavior in stores. In its 1,000 retail stores, \nT-Mobile can track how people move around, how long they stand in front of displays, and which \nphones they pick up and for how long.11\nEthnographic research  uses concepts and tools from anthropology and other social sciences to pro -\nvide deep cultural understanding of how people live and work.12 The goal is to immerse the researcher into \nconsumers\u2019 lives to uncover unarticulated desires that might not surface in any other form of research.13 \nFujitsu Laboratories, Herman Miller, Steelcase, and Xerox have embraced ethnographic research to design \nbreakthrough products. Technology companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard have anthro -\npologists and ethnologists working alongside systems engineers and software developers.14\nAny type of firm can benefit from the deep consumer insights of ethnographic research. To boost \nsagging sales for its Orville Redenbacher popcorn, ConAgra spent nine months observing families \nat home and studying weekly diaries of how they felt about various snacks.

They can also fly on competitors\u2019 planes to observe in-flight services.\nFocus Group Research.  A focus group  is a gathering of 6 to 10 people carefully selected for \ndemographic, psychographic, or other considerations and convened to discuss various topics at length \nfor a small payment. A professional moderator asks questions and probes for participants\u2019 opinions \nbased on the marketing managers\u2019 agenda. The goal is to uncover consumers\u2019 real motivations and the \nreasons why they say and do certain things. Sessions are typically recorded, and marketing managers \noften observe from behind two-way mirrors. To allow more in-depth discussion, focus groups are \ntrending smaller in size.\nFocus group research is a useful exploratory step, especially if a series of focus groups has revealed \nconsistent preferences and attitudes. Even then, however, researchers must avoid generalizing because \nthe preferences of the small number of people involved may not accurately reflect the market as a \nwhole. Some marketers feel this research setting is too contrived and prefer less artificial means.\nIn the American Airlines research, the moderator might start with a broad question, such as \u201cHow do \nyou feel about first-class air travel?\u201d Questions then might move to how people view the different airlines, \ndifferent existing services, different proposed services, and, specifically, ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi service.\nSurvey Research.  With survey research , companies undertake surveys to assess people\u2019s knowl -\nedge, beliefs, preferences, and satisfaction. A company such as American Airlines might prepare its \nown survey instrument, or (at a much lower cost) it might add questions to an omnibus survey that \ncarries the questions of several companies. It can also pose questions to an ongoing consumer panel \nrun by itself or another company. It may do a mall intercept study by having researchers approach \npeople in a shopping mall and ask them questions. Or it might add a survey request at the end of calls \nto its customer service department.\nWhen conducting surveys\u2014online, by phone, or in person\u2014companies must feel the informa -\ntion they\u2019re getting from the mounds of data makes it all worthwhile. Hotels, which live or die by what \nguests think, leave questionnaires in guest rooms and use a variety of electronic means to measure \nguest satisfaction. They also keep tabs on what is said about them on rating sites like TripAdvisor and \non social media and travel sites. Survey data can affect the services they offer, the room rates they can \ncharge, and even employee compensation. Other entities in the hospitality field also use surveys to \ntweak service. Based on feedback from passengers on overnight flights, El Al Airlines combined food \nand beverage service so that passengers could finish meals and get to sleep more quickly. In response \nto a common customer complaint, Crystal Cruises simplified its pricing for internet access.17\nOf course, companies may risk creating \u201csurvey burnout\u201d and seeing response rates plummet. \nKeeping a survey short and simple is one key to drawing participants. Offering incentives is another. \nWalmart, Rite-Aid, Petco, and Staples sweeten an invitation to fill out a survey on the cash register \nreceipt with a chance to win a prize.\nBehavioral Research.  Customers leave traces of their purchasing behavior in store scanning data, \ncatalog purchases, and customer databases. Behavioral research  uses these data to gain a  better \nunderstanding of customers and their actions. Actual purchases reflect consumers\u2019 preferences and \noften are more reliable than statements consumers offer to market researchers. For example, grocery \nshopping data show that, contrary to what they might state in interviews, high-income people don\u2019t \nnecessarily buy the more expensive brands, and many low-income people buy some expensive brands. \nThere is a wealth of online data to collect from consumers. Clearly, American Airlines can learn many \nuseful things about its passengers by analyzing ticket purchase records and online behavior.\nExperimental research is designed to capture cause-and-effect relationships by eliminating com -\npeting explanations for the findings. If the experiment is well designed and executed, research and decisions for clients.

Experiments call for selecting matched \ngroups of subjects, subjecting them to different treatments, controlling extraneous variables, and \nchecking whether observed differences in responses are statistically significant. If we can eliminate \nor control extraneous factors, we can relate the observed effects to the variations in the treatments or \nstimuli.18\nAmerican Airlines might experiment by introducing ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi service on one of \nits regular flights from Chicago to Tokyo, charging $25 one week and $15 the next week. If the plane \ncarried approximately the same number of first-class passengers each week and the particular calendar \nweeks made no difference, the airline could relate any significant difference in the number of passen -\ngers using the service to the price charged.\nResearch Instruments.  Marketing researchers have a choice of three main research instru -\nments in collecting primary data: questionnaires, qualitative measures, and technological devices.\nQuestionnaires.  A questionnaire  consists of a set of questions presented to respondents. Because \nof its flexibility, it is by far the most common instrument used to collect primary data. The form, \nwording, and sequence of the questions can all influence the responses, so testing and de-bugging \nare necessary.19 Closed-end questions  specify all the possible answers, and the responses are easier to \ninterpret and tabulate. Open-end questions  allow respondents to answer in their own words. They are \nespecially useful in exploratory research, where the researcher is looking for insight into how people \nthink, rather than measuring how many think a certain way. Table 5.1 provides examples of both \ntypes of questions.\nQualitative Measures.  Some marketers prefer qualitative methods for gauging consumer opinion \nbecause they believe that consumers\u2019 actions don\u2019t always match their answers to survey questions. \nQualitative research techniques  are relatively indirect and unstructured measurement approaches, limited \nonly by the marketing researcher\u2019s creativity, that permit a range of responses. Such methods can be \nan especially useful first step in exploring consumers\u2019 perceptions because respondents may be less \nguarded and may reveal more about themselves in the process.\nQualitative research does have its drawbacks. The samples are often very small, and results may \nnot generalize to broader populations. And different researchers examining the same qualitative results \nmay draw very different conclusions.\nNevertheless, interest in using qualitative methods is increasing. Popular methods follow.20\n\u2022 Word association.  To identify the range of possible brand associations, ask subjects what words \ncome to mind when they hear the brand\u2019s name. \u201cWhat does the Timex name mean to you? Tell \nme what comes to mind when you think of Timex watches.\u201d\n\u2022 Projective techniques.  Give people an incomplete or ambiguous stimulus and ask them to com -\nplete or explain it. In \u201cbubble exercises\u201d empty bubbles, like those in cartoons, appear in scenes of \npeople buying or using certain products or services. Subjects fill in the bubbles, indicating what \nthey believe is happening or being said. In comparison tasks, people compare brands to people, \ncountries, animals, activities, cars, nationalities, or even other brands.\n\u2022 Visualization.  Visualization requires people to create a collage from magazine photos or draw -\nings to depict their perceptions.\n\u2022 Brand personification.  This asks subjects to compare the brand with a person (or even an ani -\nmal or object): \u201cIf the brand were to come alive as a person, what would it be like, what would it \ndo, where would it live, what would it wear, who would it talk to if it went to a party (and what \nwould it talk about)?\u201d For example, the John Deere brand might make someone think of a rugged \nMidwestern male who is hardworking and trustworthy.\n\u2022 Laddering.  A series of increasingly specific \u201cwhy\u201d questions can reveal consumer motivation \nand deeper goals. Ask why someone wants to buy a Nokia cell phone. \u201cThey look well built\u201d \n(attribute). \u201cWhy is it important that the phone be well built?\u201d \u201cIt suggests Nokia is reliable\u201d (a \nfunctional benefit). \u201cWhy is reliability important?\u201d \u201cBecause my colleagues or family can be sure \nto reach me\u201d (an emotional benefit). \u201cWhy must you be available to them at all times?\u201d \u201cI can help \nthem if they\u2019re in trouble\u201d (a core value). The brand makes this person feel like a good neighbor, \nready to help others.\nMarketers don\u2019t have to choose between qualitative and quantitative measures.

Packaged \ngoods companies such as P&G, Unilever, and Kimberly-Clark combine 3-D computer simulations \nof product and packaging designs with store layouts and use eye-tracking technology to see \nwhere consumer eyes land first, how long they linger on a given item, and so on. After doing \nsuch tests, Unilever changed the shape of its Axe body wash container, the look of the logo, \nand the in-store display. In the International Finance Center Mall in Seoul, Korea, two cameras \nand a motion detector are placed above the LCD touch screens at each of the 26\u00a0information \nkiosks. Facial recognition software estimates users\u2019 age and gender, and interactive ads targeting \nthe appropriate demographic then appear. Similar applications are being developed for digital \nsidewalk billboards in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Facial recognition cameras and \nsoftware are being tested to identify and reward loyal U.S. customers of retailers and restaurants \nvia opt-in smart-phone updates. In one commercial application, SceneTap uses cameras with \nfacial detection software to post information about how full a bar is, as well as the average age \nand gender profile of the crowd, to help bar hoppers pick their next destination.22\nAs an alternative to traditional consumer research, some researchers have begun to develop \nsophisticated techniques adopted from neuroscience that monitor brain activity to better gauge con -\nsumer responses to marketing efforts. The term neuromarketing  describes brain research on the effects of \nmarketing stimuli. Firms are using EEG (electroencephalograph) technology to correlate brand activity \nwith physiological cues such as skin temperature or eye movement and thus gauge how people react \nto ads.\nResearchers studying the brain have found different results from conventional research methods. \nOne group of researchers at UCLA used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to find that \nthe Super Bowl ads for which subjects displayed the highest brain activity were different from the ads \nwith the highest stated preferences. Other research found little effect from product placement unless \nthe products in question played an integral role in the storyline. In addition, several studies have found \nhigher correlations with brain wave research and behavior than with surveys.

Others will refuse to cooperate or will give biased or dishonest answers. In order \nto control costs while maintaining high-quality responses, a company must develop a meaningful \nsampling and data collection plan.\nSampling Plan.  After choosing the research approach and instruments, the marketing researcher \nmust put together a sampling plan designed to obtain high-quality responses while keeping costs in \nline. This calls for three decisions:\n\u2022 Sampling unit.  The key question here is Whom should we survey?  In the American Airlines survey, \nshould the sampling unit consist of only first-class business travelers, only first-class vacation \ntravelers, or both? Should it include travelers under age 18? Both traveler and spouse? With the \nsampling unit chosen, marketers must next develop a sampling frame so everyone in the target \npopulation has an equal or known chance of being sampled.\n\u2022 Sample size.  The key question here is How many people should we survey?  Large samples give more \nreliable results, but it\u2019s not necessary to sample the entire target population. Samples of less than \n1 percent of a population can often provide good reliability with a credible sampling procedure.\n\u2022 Sampling procedure.  The key question here is How should we choose the respondents?  Probability \nsampling allows marketers to calculate confidence limits for sampling error and makes the sample \nmore representative. Thus, after choosing the sample, marketers could conclude that \u201cthe interval \nof five to seven trips per year has 95 chances in 100 of containing the true number of trips taken \nannually by first-class passengers flying between Chicago and Tokyo.\u201d\nContact Methods.  The marketing researcher must decide how to contact the subjects: online, in \nperson, by mail or e-mail, or by telephone.\nOnline.  The internet offers many ways to do research. A company can embed a questionnaire in its \nwebsite and offer an incentive for answering, or it can place a banner on a frequently visited site, inviting \npeople to answer questions and possibly win a prize. Online product testing can provide information \nmuch faster than traditional new-product marketing research techniques.\nMarketers can also host a real-time consumer panel or virtual focus group or sponsor a chat room, \nbulletin board, or blog where they introduce questions from time to time. They can ask customers to \nbrainstorm or have the company\u2019s Twitter followers rate an idea. Insights from Kraft-sponsored online \ncommunities helped the company develop its popular line of 100-calorie snacks.\nDel Monte tapped its 400-member, handpicked online community called \u201cI Love My Dog\u201d when \nit was considering a new breakfast treat for dogs. The consensus request was for something with a \nbacon-and-egg taste and an extra dose of vitamins and minerals. Working with the online community \nthroughout product development, the company introduced fortified \u201cSnausages Breakfast Bites\u201d in \nhalf the time usually required to launch a new product.\nA host of new online survey providers have entered the market, such as SurveyMonkey, Survey-\nGizmo, Qualtrics, and Google Consumer Surveys. Founded in 1999, SurveyMonkey has over 15 million \nregistered users. Members can create surveys to quickly post on blogs, websites, Facebook, or Twitter. Like \nany survey, however, online surveys need to ask the right people the right questions on the right topic.\nOther means to use the internet as a research tool include tracking how customers clickstream  \nthrough the company\u2019s website and move to other sites. Marketers can post different prices, headlines, \nand product features on separate websites or at different times to compare their relative effectiveness. \nOnline researchers also use text messaging in various ways\u2014to conduct a chat with a respondent, to \nprobe more deeply with a member of an online focus group, or to direct respondents to a website. Text \nmessaging is also a useful way to get teenagers to open up on topics.\nIn Person.  Personal interviewing is the most versatile method. The interviewer can ask more ques -\ntions and record additional observations about the respondent, such as dress and body language. Per -\nsonal interviewing is also the most expensive method, is subject to interviewer bias, and requires more \nplanning and supervision. In arranged interviews , marketers contact respondents for an appointment \nand frequently offer a small incentive or payment. In intercept interviews,  researchers stop people at a \nshopping mall or busy street corner and request an interview on the spot. Intercept interviews must \nbe quick, and they run the risk of including nonprobability (not random) samples.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4980, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12d718a0-969c-4469-ad54-807ce2a7e298": {"__data__": {"id_": "12d718a0-969c-4469-ad54-807ce2a7e298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d78351b-5e1c-4262-a199-eea9cfcf8b7a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "197ee6226c8b0380248b41f7cfa1a98d1a9a1a68a3236abff779063d3cd76415", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a4e9e6d-b7b9-408b-9566-367c17f507ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "0480fb0598bc0deb4052ddbabb74e7f1b2911413e69661dbda46e237e54bdda1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd07bafc-0d9b-448d-8b80-291cf0be0518", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e40704de800a5976406d95829f319d25e78809fb87915f898eb2c0d69d9a31ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 5    |  CoNDUCTING  MARKETING  RESEARCH  109\nMail and E-mail.  The mail questionnaire is one way to reach people who would not give personal \ninterviews or whose responses might be biased or distorted by the interviewers. Mail questionnaires \nrequire simple and clearly worded questions. Unfortunately, responses are usually few or slow.\nTelephone.  Telephone interviewing allows the interviewer to gather information quickly, clarify ques -\ntions if respondents do not understand them, and follow up on responses that have the potential to provide \nadditional valuable information. Interviews must be brief and not too personal. Although the response \nrate has typically been higher than for mailed questionnaires, telephone interviewing in the United States \nis getting increasingly difficult because of consumers\u2019 growing antipathy toward telemarketers.\nData Mining.  Through data mining, marketing statisticians can extract, from the mass of data, \nuseful information about individuals, trends, and segments.24 Data mining uses sophisticated statistical \nand mathematical techniques such as cluster analysis (grouping objects to ensure that objects in the \nsame group or cluster are more similar to one another than to those in other groups), predictive mod -\neling (forecasting outcomes of uncertain events), and cognitive modeling (simulating human decision \nmaking and problem solving using a computerized model).\nIn general, companies can use their data in several ways to create customer value and gain com -\npetitive advantage:\n\u2022 To identify prospects \u2014Many companies generate sales leads by advertising their product or ser -\nvice and including a response feature (such as a link to a home page, a business reply card, or a \ntoll-free phone number) in order to build a database from customer responses. The company \nsorts through the database to identify the best prospects and then contacts them by mail, e-mail, \nor phone to try to convert them into customers.\n\u2022 To decide which customers should receive a particular offer \u2014Companies interested in selling, \n up-selling, and cross-selling set up criteria describing the ideal target customer for a particular \noffer. Then they search their customer databases for those who most closely resemble the ideal. By \nnoting response rates, a company can improve its targeting precision. Following a sale, it can set up \nan automatic sequence of activities: One week later e-mail a thank-you note; five weeks later e-mail \na new offer; 10 weeks later (if the customer has not responded) e-mail an offer of a special discount.\n\u2022 To deepen customer loyalty \u2014Companies can build interest and enthusiasm by remembering cus -\ntomer preferences and sending appropriate gifts, discount coupons, and interesting reading material.\n\u2022 To reactivate customer purchases \u2014Automatic mailing programs (automatic marketing) can send \nout birthday or anniversary cards, holiday shopping reminders, or off-season promotions. The \ndatabase can help the company make attractive or timely offers.\n\u2022 To avoid serious customer mistakes \u2014A major bank confessed to a number of mistakes it had \nmade by not using its customer database well. In one case, the bank charged a customer a penalty \nfor a late payment on his mortgage, failing to note that he headed a company that was a major \ndepositor in this bank. The customer quit the bank. In a second case, two different staff members \nof the bank phoned the same mortgage customer offering a home equity loan at different prices. \nNeither knew the other had made the call. In a third case, the bank gave a premium customer only \nstandard service in another country.\nANALYZING THE INFORMATION AND MAKING \nTHE\u00a0DECISION\nThe next-to-last step in the process is to extract findings by tabulating the data and developing sum -\nmary measures. The researchers compute averages and measures of dispersion for the major vari -\nables and apply some advanced statistical techniques and decision models in the hope of discovering \nadditional findings. They may test different hypotheses and theories, applying sensitivity analysis to \ntest assumptions and the strength of the conclusions.\nThe main survey findings for the American Airlines case showed that\n\u2022 Passengers would use ultra-high-speed Wi-Fi service primarily to stay connected and to receive \nand send large documents and e-mails. Some would also surf the Web to download videos and \nsongs. They would charge the cost to their employers.\n\u2022 At $25, about 5 of 10 first-class passengers would use Wi-Fi service during a flight; at $15, \nabout 6 would.

Thus, interpreting \nthe data and relating them to the problem at hand play a crucial role in managerial decision making.\nMeasuring Market Demand\nUnderstanding the marketing environment and conducting marketing research can help to identify \nmarketing opportunities. The company must then measure and forecast the size, growth, and profit \npotential of each new opportunity. Sales forecasts prepared by marketing are used by finance to raise \ncash for investment and operations; by manufacturing to establish capacity and output; by purchas -\ning to acquire the right amount of supplies; and by human resources to hire the needed workers. If \nthe forecast is off the mark, the company will face excess or inadequate inventory. Because it is based \non estimates of demand, managers need to define exactly what they mean by \u201cmarket demand.\u201d\nDuPont\u2019s Performance Materials group knew that even when DuPont Tyvek had the dominant \nshare of the $100-million market for air-barrier membranes in construction, there was greater oppor -\ntunity to tap into the entire multi-billion-dollar U.S. home construction market with additional prod -\nucts and services.\nKEY CONCEPTS IN DEMAND MEASUREMENT\nThe major concepts in demand measurement are market/company demand, market forecast, com -\npany sales forecast, market potential, and company sales potential. We discuss these concepts in \nmore detail next.\nMarket demand  for an offering is the total volume that could be bought by a defined customer \ngroup in a defined geographic area in a defined time period in a defined marketing environment under \na defined marketing program.\nCompany demand  is the company\u2019s estimated share of market demand at alternative levels of com -\npany marketing effort in a given time period. It depends on how the company\u2019s products, services, prices, \nand communications are perceived relative to those of competitors. Other things equal, the company\u2019s \nmarket share depends on the relative scale and effectiveness of its market expenditures. As noted previ -\nously, marketing model builders have developed sales response functions to measure how a company\u2019s \nsales are affected by its marketing expenditure level, marketing mix, and marketing effectiveness.25\nThe market demand corresponding to the actual level of industry marketing expenditure is called \nthe market forecast .\nThe company sales forecast  is the expected level of company sales based on a chosen marketing \nplan and an assumed marketing environment. Two other concepts are important here. A sales quota  is \nthe sales goal set for a product line, company division, or sales representative. It is primarily a mana -\ngerial device for defining and stimulating sales effort, and it is often set slightly higher than estimated \nsales to stretch the sales force\u2019s effort. A sales budget  is a conservative estimate of the expected volume \nof sales, primarily for making current purchasing, production, and cash flow decisions. It\u2019s based on \nthe need to avoid excessive risk and is generally set slightly lower than the sales forecast.\nTotal market potential  consists of the maximum  sales available to all firms in an industry dur -\ning a given period, under a given level of industry marketing effort, and under extant environmental \nconditions. The market forecast shows expected  market demand, not maximum market demand. For \nthe latter, we need to visualize the level of market demand resulting from a very high level of industry \nmarketing expenditure, where further increases in marketing effort would have little effect. Market \npotential is the limit approached by market demand as industry marketing expenditures approach \ninfinity for a given marketing environment.

It\u2019s higher during prosperity than during a recession. \nA common way to estimate total market potential is to multiply the potential number of buyers by the \naverage quantity each buyer purchases and then by the price.\nCompany sales potential  is the sales limit approached by company demand as company marketing \neffort increases relative to that of competitors. The absolute limit of company demand is, of course, the \nmarket potential. The two would be equal if the company captured 100 percent of the market. In most \ncases, company sales potential is less than the market potential, even when company marketing expendi -\ntures increase considerably. Each competitor has a hard core of loyal buyers unresponsive to other compa -\nnies\u2019 efforts to woo them, which makes it challenging to capture all competitors\u2019 customers in the market.\nFORECASTING MARKET DEMAND\nForecasting is the art of anticipating what buyers are likely to do under a given set of conditions. For \nmajor consumer durables such as appliances, research organizations conduct periodic surveys of \nconsumer buying intentions, asking questions like Do you intend to buy an automobile within the next six \nmonths?  Surveys also inquire into consumers\u2019 present and future personal finances and expectations \nabout the economy. They combine bits of information into a consumer confidence measure (Confer -\nence Board) or a consumer sentiment measure (Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan). \nIn most markets, good forecasting is a key factor in success.\nCompanies commonly prepare a macroeconomic forecast first, followed by an industry forecast, \nfollowed by a company sales forecast. The macroeconomic forecast projects inflation, unemployment, \ninterest rates, consumer spending, business investment, government expenditures, net exports, and \nother variables. The end result is a forecast of gross domestic product (GDP) that the firm uses, along \nwith other environmental indicators, to forecast industry sales. The company derives its sales forecast \nby assuming it will win a certain market share.\nHow do firms develop forecasts? They may create their own or buy forecasts from outside sources, \nsuch as marketing research firms that interview customers, distributors, and other knowledgeable \nparties. Specialized forecasting firms produce long-range forecasts of particular macroenvironmental \ncomponents such as population, natural resources, and technology. Examples are IHS Global Insight \n(a merger of Data Resources and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates), Forrester Research, \nand the Gartner Group. Futurist research firms such as the Institute for the Future, Hudson Institute, \nand the Futures Group produce speculative scenarios.\nAll forecasts are built on one of three information bases: what people say, what people do, or what \npeople have done. Using what people say requires surveying buyers\u2019 intentions, composites of sales \nforce opinions, and expert opinion. Building a forecast on what people do means putting the product \ninto a test market to measure buyer response. To use the final basis\u2014what people have done\u2014firms \nanalyze records of past buying behavior or use time-series analysis or statistical demand analysis.\n\u2022 Industry Sales and Market Shares.  The industry trade association will often collect and publish \ntotal industry sales, although it usually does not list individual company sales separately. With \nthis information, however, each company can evaluate its own performance against that of the \nindustry as a whole. If a company\u2019s sales are increasing by 5 percent a year and industry sales are \nincreasing by 10 percent, the company is losing its relative standing in the industry.\nAnother way to estimate sales is to buy reports from a marketing research firm that audits \ntotal sales and brand sales. Nielsen Media Research audits retail sales in various supermarket and \ndrugstore product categories. A company can purchase this information and compare its per -\nformance to that of the total industry or of any competitor to see whether it is gaining or losing \nshare, overall or by brand. Because distributors typically will not supply information about how \nmany competitors\u2019 products they are selling, business-to-business marketers operate with less \nknowledge of their market share results.\n\u2022 Survey of Buyers\u2019 Intentions.  For business buying, research firms can carry out buyer-intention \nsurveys for plant, equipment, and materials, usually falling within a 10 percent margin of error. \nThese surveys are useful in estimating demand for industrial products, consumer durables, prod -\nuct purchases that require advance planning, and new products.

Sales reps might have better insight into developing trends than any other \ngroup, and forecasting might give them greater confidence in their sales quotas and more incen -\ntive to achieve them. A \u201cgrassroots\u201d forecasting procedure provides detailed estimates broken \ndown by product, territory, customer, and sales rep.\nFew companies use these estimates without making some adjustments, however. Sales rep -\nresentatives might be pessimistic or optimistic, they might not know how the company\u2019s market -\ning plans will influence future sales in their territory, and they might deliberately underestimate \ndemand so the company will set a low sales quota. To encourage better estimating, the company \ncould offer incentives or assistance, such as information about marketing plans or how past fore -\ncasts compared with actual sales.\n\u2022 Expert Opinion.  Companies can also obtain forecasts from experts, including dealers, distribu -\ntors, suppliers, marketing consultants, and trade associations. Dealer estimates are subject to the \nsame strengths and weaknesses as sales force estimates. Many companies buy economic and \nindustry forecasts from well-known economic-forecasting firms that have more data available \nand offer more forecasting expertise.\nOccasionally, companies will invite a group of experts to prepare a forecast. The experts \nexchange views and produce an estimate as a group ( group-discussion method ) or individually, in \nwhich case another analyst might combine the results into a single estimate ( pooling of individual \nestimates ). Further rounds of estimating and refining follow (the Delphi method).27\n\u2022 Past-Sales Analysis.  Firms can develop sales forecasts on the basis of past sales. Time-series analysis  \nbreaks past sales into four components (trend, cycle, seasonal, and erratic) and projects them into the \nfuture. Exponential smoothing  projects the next period\u2019s sales by combining and the most recent sales, \ngiving more weight to the latter. Statistical demand analysis  measures the impact of a set of causal fac -\ntors (such as income, marketing expenditures, and price) on the sales level. Econometric analysis  builds \nsets of equations that describe a system and statistically derives the different parameters that make \nup the equations. Advanced machine learning techniques are revolutionizing marketing by automat -\ning and speeding up tasks that range from analyzing sales and revenue to spotting industry trends.\n\u2022 Market-Test Method.  When buyers don\u2019t plan their purchases carefully or experts are unavail -\nable or unreliable, a direct market test can help forecast new-product sales or the sales of estab -\nlished products in a new distribution channel or territory.\nMeasuring Marketing Productivity\nAlthough we can easily quantify marketing expenses and investments as inputs in the short run, the \nresulting outputs (such as broader brand awareness, enhanced brand image, greater customer loyalty, \nand improved new-product prospects) may take months or years to manifest themselves. Meanwhile, \ninternal changes within the organization and external changes in the marketing environment may \ncoincide with the marketing expenditures, making it hard to isolate their effects.28\nNevertheless, marketing research must assess the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing activi -\nties. Two complementary approaches to measuring marketing productivity are (1) marketing metrics  to \nassess marketing effects and (2) marketing-mix modeling  to estimate causal relationships and measure \nhow marketing activity affects outcomes. Marketing dashboards  are a structured way to disseminate \nthe insights gleaned from these two approaches.\nMARKETING METRICS\nMarketers employ a wide variety of measures to assess marketing effects.29 Marketing metrics is the \nset of measures that help marketers quantify, compare, and interpret their performance.30\nThe CMO of Mary Kay cosmetics would focus on four long-term brand strength metrics\u2014\nmarket awareness, consideration, trial, and 12-month beauty consultant productivity\u2014as \nwell as a number of short-term, program-specific metrics such as ad impressions, website \ntraffic, and purchase conversion.\nThe VP of marketing at Virgin America would look at a broad set of online metrics\u2014cost \nper acquisition, cost per click, and cost per thousand page impressions (CPM). She would also \nlook at total dollars driven by natural and paid search and online display advertising, as well \nas at tracking results and other metrics from the offline world.\nMarketers choose one or more measures based on the particular issues or problems they face. \n Mindbody, a Web-based business management software provider for wellness and beauty industries", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4787, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54c48519-7082-4815-88df-41a44175df68": {"__data__": {"id_": "54c48519-7082-4815-88df-41a44175df68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da519eb1-7aa4-461b-b591-97d27f5dac2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "17575e75e9ab404d5561500c9e0291892d803b9bd90a05077ff764e8b9f9890d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e781179a-34d2-4949-b9b6-319144996568", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "b49417a35ceee6a2ddc47f28d7ce8b3f522955e5c3c05f42bca270520724a721", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d58161c-5559-4132-9998-3594fd6c6de2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ccb9c04261b378bacbb4bd2cf660832531ce092011bd2abb762a77d01d281e02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 5    |  CoNDUCTING  MARKETING  RESEARCH  113\nworldwide, tracks numerous online analytics, including landing-page conversions, click-through rates for \nonline ads, and rankings on Google search.

(2) Social media presence  shows \ndemographic and geographic responses to social media channels across different markets. (3)\u00a0  Permission \nmarketing statistics  measure interactions and engagement with consumers from automated emails.\nLondon Business School\u2019s Tim Ambler believes that firms can split evaluation of marketing per -\nformance into two parts: short-term results and changes in brand equity.31 Short-term results often \nreflect profit-and-loss concerns as shown by sales turnover, shareholder value, or some combination \nof the two. Brand-equity measures could include customer awareness, attitudes, and behaviors; market \nshare; relative price premium; number of complaints; distribution and availability; total number of \ncustomers; perceived quality, and loyalty and retention.32\nCompanies can also monitor an extensive set of internal metrics, such as innovation. For example, \n3M tracks the proportion of sales resulting from its recent innovations. Ambler also recommends \ndeveloping employee measures and metrics, arguing that \u201cend users are the ultimate customers, but \nyour own staff are your first; you need to measure the health of the internal market.\u201d\nMARKETING-MIX MODELING\nMarketing accountability also means that marketers must more precisely estimate the effects of dif -\nferent marketing investments. Marketing-mix models  analyze data from a variety of sources such as \nretailer scanner data, company shipment data, as well as pricing, media, and promotion expenditure \ndata, to understand more precisely the effects of specific marketing activities.33 To deepen understanding, \nmarketers can conduct multivariate analyses, such as regression analysis, to investigate how each mar -\nketing element influences marketing outcomes such as brand sales or market share.\nEspecially popular with packaged-goods marketers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Col -\ngate, the findings from marketing-mix modeling help allocate or reallocate expenditures. Analyses \nexplore which part of ad budgets are wasted, what optimal spending levels are, and what minimum \ninvestment levels should be.\nAlthough marketing-mix modeling helps to isolate effects, it is less effective at assessing how differ -\nent marketing elements work in combination. Wharton\u2019s Dave Reibstein also notes that it has three other \nshortcomings:34 (1) Marketing-mix modeling focuses on incremental growth instead of on baseline sales \nor long-term effects. (2) The integration of important metrics such as customer satisfaction, awareness, \nand brand equity into marketing-mix modeling is limited. (3) Marketing-mix modeling generally fails \nto incorporate metrics related to competitors, the trade, or the sales force (the average business spends \nfar more on the sales force and trade promotion than on advertising or consumer promotion).\nMARKETING DASHBOARDS\nFirms also employ organizational processes and systems to make sure they maximize the value of all \nthese different metrics. Management can assemble a summary set of relevant internal and external \nmeasures in a marketing dashboard for synthesis and interpretation. Marketing dashboards are like \nthe instrument panel in a car or plane, visually displaying real-time indicators to ensure proper func -\ntioning. Formally, marketing dashboards are \u201ca concise set of interconnected performance drivers to \nbe viewed in common throughout the organization.\u201d35 Company input to the marketing dashboard \nshould include two key market-based scorecards: one that reflects performance and one that provides \npossible early warning signals.\nDashboards are only as good as the information on which they\u2019re based, but sophisticated visual -\nization tools are helping bring data alive. Color-coding, symbols, and different types of charts, tables, \nand gauges are easy to use and effective. Some companies are also appointing marketing controllers to \nreview budget items and expenses. Increasingly, these controllers use business intelligence software to \ncreate digital versions of marketing dashboards that aggregate data from internal and external sources.\nMarketing dashboards provide all the up-to-the-minute information necessary to run the business \noperations for a company\u2014such as sales versus forecast, distribution channel effectiveness, brand-\nequity evolution, and human capital development. An effective dashboard will focus thinking, improve \ninternal communications, and reveal where marketing investments are paying off and where they \naren\u2019t.

During their \nobservations, IDE o noticed that children hold their tooth-\nbrushes differently than adults do. Whereas adults have the \nfine motor skills to move their toothbrushes with just their \nfingers, children grip the toothbrush with their fist to move \nit around. Adult toothbrushes posed problems for children \nbecause they were thin and hard to hold.

IDE o created a voting system that would \nbe useful and accessible to all types of voters: those who are \nvision and hearing impaired, are in wheelchairs, have learning \ndisabilities, are unfamiliar with technology, and speak lan-\nguages other than English. The new system debuted during \nthe 2020 Presidential Primary.\nIDEo has also partnered with The North Face to help \nbuild the outdoor-product company\u2019s brand story in China. The North Face wanted to expand its presence in China but \nfound that the extreme-sport and adventuring narratives \nused in the company\u2019s U.S. brand story did not resonate with \n Chinese consumers. IDE o researchers found that Chinese \nconsumers responded better to a brand story that encour -\naged them to escape big-city life and enjoy the relaxing free-\ndom of spending time with others in nature. IDE o researchers \nand designers helped build the company\u2019s Chinese  marketing \ncampaign, and they collaborated on digital platforms and \n in-store displays to attract new customers.\nWorking with the J.M. Smucker Company, IDE o \nhelped Folgers, America\u2019s leading at-home coffee brand, to \n better connect with a millennial audience. The collaboration \nresulted in 1850, a brand inspired by the heritage and history \nof Folgers. IDE o helped design the go-to-market product \nexperience, including packaging, retail, and merchandise. \nIntroduced in 2018, 1850 was considered the top launch in \nthe Coffee Category for 2019.\nThe one constant behind IDE o\u2019s many solutions is its \napplication of human-centered design. IDE o continues to \nuphold its philosophy that the best design solutions are found \nby orienting the process around the user\u2019s desires and needs. \nIDEo has applied human-centered design to a  multitude of \nfields, including financial services, nonprofit organizations, \nbrand building, health care, learning and  education, and \n consumer goods.38\nQuestions\n1. Why has IDE o been so successful?\n2. What is the most difficult challenge that IDE o faces in \nconducting its research and designing its products?\n3. In the end, IDE o creates great solutions for companies \nthat then receive all the credit. Should IDE o try to create \nmore brand awareness for itself?

Two years later, the pair named their business \nLEGo, short for the Danish words leg godt , which translate \nto \u201cplay well.\u201d During the next several years, LEG o expanded \nits product line to include wooden ducks, clothes hangers, \nand simple wooden bricks. It wasn\u2019t until 1947, when LEG o \npurchased a plastic injection-molding machine, that it began \nto mass produce plastic toys that served as the predecessor \nof the modern LEG o brick. In 1957, LEG o created the inter -\nlocking plastic brick, and the following year it introduced the \nstud-and-tube coupling mechanism that became the model \nfor all future LEG o toys. LEG o bricks became wildly popu-\nlar among customers, and the company began expanding \nworldwide in the early 1960s. In 1964 the company started \nselling sets, which included the parts and instructions to con-\nstruct a particular model. Soon thereafter, theme sets from \nmovies and books such as the Harry Potter, Star Wars , and \nJurassic Park  series became some of the most sought-after \nchildren\u2019s toys in the world.\nLEGo\u2019s growth and expansion slowed at the end of the \n20th century. Birth rates had declined, and children were less \ninterested in toys that didn\u2019t offer instant gratification. The \nmany theme parks that LEG o opened around the world failed \nto turn a profit because of the company\u2019s unfamiliarity with \nthe hospitality industry. LEG o began churning out increas-\ningly complex and unique sets to draw in more customers, \nbut sales failed to grow. The increased complexity of LEG o \nbricks also made production more complicated and inven-\ntory harder to manage. Major retailers ended up with large \nportions of inventory unsold, even during holiday seasons. \nIn 1998, the company suffered its first financial loss, and by \n2003, LEG o was on the verge of bankruptcy.\nIn 2004, Jorgen Knudstorp was promoted to CE o, only \nthree years after arriving at the company. Knudstorp, who \nhad previously worked at McKinsey & Company, began \nturning the company around and improving businesses pro-\ncesses, cutting costs, and better managing cash flow, which \nstabilized the company. To revive the popularity of LEG o \ntoys, Knudstorp focused heavily on innovation and empha-\nsized market and consumer research. Knudstorp believed \nthat in order to rekindle the emotional connection between \ncustomers and LEG o toys, LEG o had to deeply understand \neach customer\u2019s desires and behavior.\nLEGo\u2019s shift toward basing decisions on extensive \nresearch reduced complexity in production and ensured the success of its product releases. In 2011, the company \nlaunched the LEG o Friends line, an effort to attract more \ngirls to the brand. The company\u2019s market research led to the \ninsight that girls preferred to use their LEG o sets for roleplay, \nwhereas boys enjoyed strong narratives and backstories, \nsuch as those offered by the Ninjago and Legends of Chima \nsets. Both girls and boys enjoyed the building aspect of \nLEGos. The LEG o Friends line offered more sets and loca-\ntions like shopping malls, juice bars, and creative labs, so \ngirls could use their figurines to roleplay. The line caught on \nstrongly in markets worldwide, including China, Germany, \nand the United States.\nLEGo also established the Future Lab, a secretive \nresearch and development team that is responsible for cre-\nating some of its most innovative and successful toy lines \never. Future Lab teams are made up of industrial design-\ners, programmers, marketers, and even master builders, \nwho brainstorm to generate modern products. During an \nannual one-week field trip to Barcelona, Future Lab teams \nextensively brainstorm and produce prototypes from the \nbins of bricks, animation software, and professional-quality \ndigital cameras available.

LEG o toy lines created \nby the Future Lab include LEG o Mindstorms, a robotics \nplatform created in partnership with MIT; LEG o Fusion, an \n augmented-reality application; and LEG o Architecture, col-\nlections that model the world\u2019s most famous buildings.\nIn 2017, LEG o surpassed rival Mattel to become the \nbiggest toy manufacturer in the world.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a1850c8-6ce9-4c88-b00a-cdcc0fb49fcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a1850c8-6ce9-4c88-b00a-cdcc0fb49fcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "37ceb53f-f275-44da-8b4f-e03e519b97fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "de7c585e4f75c71aa96b019b609ea1a11d09bbfee827b3afb7d0d1ce98d41a8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70d7d713-8115-4f36-9dfd-7fdd9b0d4c24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap5.pdf"}, "hash": "21621fe0371c53fa767ac8a8aa0c7cd0f772f7b9c0e01627f338b1cf1568a6d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Future Lab teams are made up of industrial design-\ners, programmers, marketers, and even master builders, \nwho brainstorm to generate modern products.
