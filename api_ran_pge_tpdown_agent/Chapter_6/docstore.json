represent one of the most famous \nU.S. brands and were even the subject of an Andy Warhol portrait. Several years ago, though, the \ncentury-and-a-half-old company suffered a double whammy: Overall consumption of canned soup \ndeclined 13 percent, and Campbell\u2019s market share dropped from 67 percent to 53 percent due to \nthe popularity of fresh and premium soups. To stop the sales slide, Campbell set out to better under -\nstand the 18-to-34-year-olds who make up 25 percent of the U.S. population and will profoundly \naffect the company\u2019s future.

They need \nto identify the market segments they can serve effectively. Identifying these market segments \nrequires a keen understanding of consumer behavior and careful strategic thinking about what makes \neach segment unique and different.

For each target segment, establish, communicate, and deliver the right benefit(s) for the com -\npany\u2019s market offering (developing a value proposition and positioning).\nThis chapter will focus on the first two steps: how to segment the market and identify target \ncustomers. Chapter 10 discusses the third step: how to develop a value proposition and positioning to \nbuild viable market offerings that grow over time and withstand competitive attacks.\nIdentifying Target Customers\nThere are many techniques for identifying target customers.2 Once the firm has identified its market \nopportunities, it must decide how many and which ones to target. Marketers are increasingly combin -\ning several variables in an effort to identify smaller, better-defined target groups in order to develop \nan offering that can fulfill these customers\u2019 needs better than the competition. Thus, a bank may not \nonly identify a group of wealthy retired adults but also, within that group, distinguish several seg -\nments depending on current income, assets, savings, and risk preferences. This has led some market \nresearchers to advocate a needs-based targeting approach .\nTargeting  is the process of identifying customers for whom the company will optimize its offer -\ning. Simply put, targeting reflects the company\u2019s choice of which customers it will prioritize and which \ncustomers it will ignore when designing, communicating, and delivering its offering. The logic of iden -\ntifying target customers and the strategic and tactical aspects of this process are discussed in more \ndetail in the following sections.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3529, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1afaa41b-53f9-4844-964b-2350320db23d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1afaa41b-53f9-4844-964b-2350320db23d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e473a50e-050f-414a-bb0a-d76e4959550e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "5f0867d75bc1a17e64a26bc8b97b029152e94b382ca67f8858c6be4583573c7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0ac59fb-7cd9-486e-9987-d485362d4bff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "6efbb9a8c3786eafed30cae753d840fe6e8919925eefbef9b8c520c892088323", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dff40395-5ada-4f8f-8036-aaea73a5e26d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c5ad9a7adf46e5a21aa94722cb908ac490bfb28799ee4f673b72322f2422e24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "120 PART  3   |  DEVELOPING A VIABLE MARKET STRATEGY\nTHE LOGIC OF TARGETING\nIn mass marketing , the firm ignores segment differences and goes after the whole market with one \noffer. It designs a marketing program for a product with a superior image that can be sold to the broad -\nest number of buyers via mass distribution and mass communications. Undifferentiated marketing is \nappropriate when all consumers have roughly the same preferences and the market shows no natural \nsegments. Henry Ford epitomized this strategy when he offered the Model-T Ford in one color, black.\nThe argument for mass marketing is that it creates the largest potential market, which leads to \nthe lowest costs, which in turn can lead to lower prices or higher margins. The narrow product line \nkeeps down the costs of research and development, production, inventory, transportation, marketing \nresearch, advertising, and product management. The undifferentiated communication program also \nreduces costs. However, many critics point to the increased splintering of the market and the prolifera -\ntion of marketing channels and communication, which make it difficult and increasingly expensive \nto reach a mass audience.\nWhen different groups of consumers have different needs and wants, marketers can define mul -\ntiple segments. The company can often better design, price, disclose, and deliver the product or service \nand also fine-tune the marketing program and activities to better counter competitors\u2019 marketing. \nIn targeted marketing, the firm sells different products to all the different segments of the market. \nCosmetics firm Est\u00e9e Lauder markets brands that appeal to women (and men) of different tastes: The \nflagship brand, the original Est\u00e9e Lauder, appeals to older consumers; Clinique and M\u2219A\u2219C cater to \nyoung women; Aveda to aromatherapy enthusiasts; and Origins to eco-conscious consumers who \nwant cosmetics made from natural ingredients.3\nThe ultimate level of targeting is the one-to-one approach  in which each market segment comprises \na single customer.4 As companies have grown proficient at gathering information about individual \ncustomers and business partners (suppliers, distributors, retailers), and as their factories have been \ndesigned more flexibly, they have increased their ability to individualize market offerings, messages, \nand media.\nConsumers can buy customized jeans, cowboy boots, and bicycles that cost thousands of dollars. \nPeter Wagner started Wagner Custom Skis in Telluride, Colorado, in 2006. His company now makes \nabout 1,000 snowboards and pairs of skis a year, with prices that start at $1,750. Each ski or snowboard \nis unique and precisely fitted to the preferences and riding style of its owner. Strategies such as using \nNASA-like materials and making adjustments of thousands of an inch send a strong performance \nmessage, matched by the attractive aesthetic of the skis.5\nOne-to-one marketing is not for every company. It works best for firms that normally collect a \ngreat deal of individual customer information and carry a lot of products that can be cross-sold, need \nperiodic replacement or upgrading, and offer high value. For others, the required investment in infor -\nmation collection, hardware, and software may exceed the payout. The cost of goods is raised beyond \nwhat the customer is willing to pay.\nMass customization  is the ability of a company to meet each customer\u2019s requirements\u2014to pre -\npare on a mass basis individually designed products, services, programs, and communications.6 MINI \nCooper\u2019s online \u201cconfigurator\u201d enables prospective buyers to virtually select and try out many options \nfor a new MINI. Coke\u2019s Freestyle vending machine allows users to choose from more than 100 Coke \nbrands or custom flavors, and even to create their own.\nServices are also a natural setting for customized marketing. Airlines, hotels, and rental car agen -\ncies are attempting to offer more individualized experiences. Even political candidates are embracing \ncustomized marketing. On Facebook, politicians can find an individual\u2019s preferences by observing \nthe groups or causes he or she joins. Then, using Facebook\u2019s ad platform, the campaign team can \ntest hundreds of ad messages designed to reflect the theme of these other interests. Hikers may get an \nenvironmentally themed message; members of particular religious groups may get a Christian-themed \nmessage.\nSTRATEGIC AND TACTICAL TARGETING\nTargeting can be strategic or tactical based on the criteria a company uses to zero in on target custom -\ners. Strategic targeting  focuses on customers whose needs the company can fulfill by ensuring that \nits offerings are customized to their needs. Tactical targeting  identifies the ways in which the company \ncan reach these strategically important customers.

Thus, \nrather than trying to reach the target audience with one offering that endeavors to lure a wide range \nof customers with diverse needs, strategic targeting is based on the deliberate choice to ignore some \ncustomers to better serve other customers with an offering that matches their specific needs. Tactical \ntargeting takes the opposite approach.

Companies have failed because of their unwillingness to sacrifice market \nbreadth and focus only on customers for whom their offering could create superior value. Targeting \nis not based solely on identifying customers that the company intends to serve: It must also be based \non a meaningful assessment of customers it deliberately chooses not to serve, and without such an \nassessment, a viable market strategy is impossible.\nA manager must address two key questions when evaluating the viability of a particular customer \nsegment: Can the company create superior value for these customers? Can these customers create superior value for \nthe company?\nThe answer to the first question hinges on the degree to which company resources are compatible \nwith target customers\u2019 needs. The company must have the assets and competencies necessary to design \nan offer that creates customer value. The answer to the second question is determined by the attractive -\nness of the target customers. That is, do they have the ability to create value for the company? These \ntwo principles of strategic targeting\u2014target compatibility and target attractiveness\u2014are discussed in \ngreater detail in the following sections.\nTARGET COMPATIBILITY\nTarget compatibility  is a reflection of the company\u2019s ability to outdo the competition in fulfilling the \nneeds of target customers\u2014in other words, to create superior customer value. Target compatibility is a \nfunction of the company\u2019s resources and its capacity to use these resources in a way that creates value \nfor target customers. The right resources are important because they allow the company to create an \noffering that can deliver superior value to customers in a manner that is both effective and cost efficient.\nEssential resources for the success of a company\u2019s targeting strategy include factors such as:\n\u2022 Business infrastructure , which includes assets such as manufacturing infrastructure that \nhouses the company\u2019s production facilities and equipment; service infrastructure like call cen -\nters and customer relationship management solutions; supply-chain infrastructure that includes \nprocurement infrastructure and processes; and management infrastructure that encompasses \nthe company\u2019s business management culture.\n\u2022 Access to scarce resources  gives the company a distinct competitive edge because it restricts the \nstrategic options of competitors. For example, securing unique natural resources, prime manu -\nfacturing and retail locations, and a memorable web domain can be highly beneficial for the \ncompany.\n\u2022 Skilled employees  with technological, operational, and business expertise\u2014especially those \ninvolved in research and development, education, and consulting\u2014are prime strategic assets.\n\u2022 Technological expertise , the expertise required to develop an offering that addresses a particular \ncustomer need, includes a company\u2019s proprietary processes, its technological processes, and its \nintellectual property such as patents and trade secrets.\n\u2022 Strong brands  enhance value by conferring unique identification on the offering and generat -\ning meaningful associations that create value over and above the value created by the offering\u2019s \nattributes. Brands are of particular importance in commoditized industries where only minor \ndifferences exist among the competitive products and services.\n\u2022 Collaborator networks  include vertical networks of collaborators in the company\u2019s supply chain \n(suppliers and distributors) and horizontal networks of research and development, manufactur -\ning, and promotion collaborators that help the company create its offering and inform customers \nabout it.\nAn important aspect of assessing a company\u2019s resources is identifying its core competencies.8  \nA core competency  has three characteristics: (1) it is a source of competitive advantage and makes a \n significant contribution to perceived customer benefits, (2) it has applications in a wide variety of mar -\nkets, and (3) it is difficult for competitors to imitate.9 Companies today outsource less critical resources \nif they can obtain better quality or lower cost. Many textile, chemical, and computer/electronic product \nfirms use offshore manufacturers and focus on product design and development and marketing, their \ncore competencies. The key to success is to own and nurture the resources and competencies that make \nup the essence  of the business.10\nAlthough the ability of a company to create value for target customers is an essential component, \nsuccessful targeting necessitates another important criterion: Target customers also must be able to \ncreate value for the company, meaning the target must be attractive to the company.

Thus, the company must carefully select customers for whom to tailor its offering based on the \ndegree to which they can contribute value to the company and assist the company in reaching its goal. \nTarget customers can create two kinds of value for a company: monetary  and strategic .\nMonetary Value.  Monetary value consists of the capability of customers to engender profits for \nthe company. Monetary value includes both the revenues  a particular customer segment generates and \nthe costs  of serving these customers.\n\u2022 Customer revenues  involve money received by the company from customers for the right to \nown or use its offering. A number of market and customer factors influence revenue volume. \nThese include market size and rate of growth, as well as the buying power of customers, their \nbrand loyalty, and their price sensitivity; the pricing power of the company; the intensity of com -\npetition in the market; and context factors such as the economy, government regulations, and the \nphysical environment.\n\u2022 Costs of serving target customers  include the expense of tailoring the offering\u2019s benefits to \nthe needs of target customers, along with communicating and delivering the offering to them. In \naddition, the cost of serving target customers can include the expense of acquiring and retaining \nthese customers, providing them with post-purchase support, and offering incentives and loyalty \nprograms.\nMany companies tend to focus almost exclusively on the monetary aspect of value created by \ntarget customers because customer revenues and costs are more easily quantified. By espousing this \nnarrow view, they overlook the fact that the strategic value that target customers create can be a sig -\nnificant factor in the value they contribute to the company.\nStrategic Value.  Strategic value refers to nonmonetary benefits that customers bring to the com -\npany. The three main types of strategic value are social value , scale value , and information value .\n\u2022 Social value  reflects the influence of target customers on other potential buyers. Customers \nmight be as attractive to the company for their social networks and ability to impact the opinions \nof other buyers as for the revenues they offer to the company. Companies routinely target opinion \nleaders, trendsetters, and mavens because of their capacity to promote and endorse the company\u2019s \noffering via social networking.\n\u2022 Scale value  denotes the benefits derived from the scale of the company\u2019s operations. The eco -\nnomics of its business model might lead a company to target low-margin or sometimes even \nunprofitable customers, as is the case with airlines, hotels, and cruise lines that have large fixed \ncosts and smaller variable costs. A company in its early growth stages might decide to target \nlow-margin customers to build a product and user base that will serve as a platform for future \ngrowth. The rapid growth of Uber, Airbnb, Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook illustrates the benefits \nof building large-scale user networks.\n\u2022 Information value  is the worth of the information that customers provide. One reason why a \ncompany might target customers is for the wealth of data they can furnish the company about \ntheir needs and profile. This information can help the company design, communicate, and deliver \nvalue to other customers with similar needs. A company might also target customers who are \nlikely to be early adopters of the company\u2019s offering, preceding mass market adoption. These \n\u201clead users\u201d allow the company to glean feedback on how it can modify and enhance the offering \nto attract more buyers.\nAssessing the strategic value of different customer segments is more challenging than assessing \ntheir monetary value. Strategic value is not as readily observable and can be difficult to quantify. A \ncustomer\u2019s ability to influence others often cannot be discerned directly, and even if it can be quanti -\nfied by assessing the number of followers on social media, the customer\u2019s impact on the preferences \nof others is difficult to gauge. In spite of the difficulty of determining strategic value, when choosing \ntarget customers it cannot be overlooked, either as a complement to their monetary value or as the \nmain component of their value to the company. Some highly influential customers who might never \ngenerate a dollar for the company directly may exert significant influence on broader and more profit -\nable segments of the market that decide to purchase the company\u2019s offering.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4719, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "987127c2-df59-4956-a786-ee0ab73c5d6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "987127c2-df59-4956-a786-ee0ab73c5d6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e395d0cd-ae87-48e7-b4a4-accb4029e74a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "d991df89268d9a3494a508642ebcc37663c8bbc215588a7d4cbb44fb59522c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb3b6635-c2b4-4673-ad2b-65f4898b5072", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "087dc488a86f447f9bdb6943f32af2f89c8677d25eb46d33e4af0b918c73c213", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de189fa7-a197-4a75-bb13-957e130a095a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "926ac99f6708b4286177f0642159bf89182fd6511f064ed5dad6ad409b2007a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "124 PART  3   |  DEVELOPING A VIABLE MARKET STRATEGY\nTactical Targeting\nAlthough tactical targeting  involves identifying target customers, as does strategic targeting, it has \na different objective: to determine which customers to target and which to ignore, and to determine \nhow the company\u2019s offering can be effectively and cost-efficiently communicated and delivered to \nthe target customers that have already been selected. The following sections discuss the key aspects \nof tactical targeting in more detail.\nDEFINING THE CUSTOMER PROFILE\nAfter the company decides on a strategically viable target market, it must garner information on \nthe profile of these customers to communicate the offering\u2019s attributes and deliver it to them. \n Tactical targeting identifies the most cost-effective ways to accomplish this by linking the customer \nneed that the offering wants to fulfill with observable customer characteristics. These observable \n factors\u2014the customer profile \u2014involve demographic, geographic, behavioral, and psychographic \ndescriptors.\n\u2022 Demographic factors  include age, gender, income, occupation, level of education, religion, eth -\nnicity, nationality, employment status, population density (urban or rural), social class, household \nsize, and stage in the life cycle. If the company\u2019s target customers are not individuals but other \ncompanies, they are identified by factors referred to as firmographics, which include size, orga -\nnizational structure, industry, growth, revenues, and profitability.\n\u2022 Geographic (geolocation) factors  reflect the physical location of target customers. Geo -\ngraphic data describe where  the customers are located, in contrast to demographic data, \nwhich describe who  the target customers are. Some geographic indicators can be relatively \nenduring (e.g., a customer\u2019s permanent address), whereas other geolocation factors are \ndynamic and change frequently (e.g., the current location of a customer at a particular time). \nThe ubiquity of mobile devices that identify individual customers and can pinpoint their \nexact location in real time has dramatically increased the importance of geographic factors \nin targeting.\n\u2022 Behavioral factors  describe customers\u2019 actions. These factors can include customers\u2019 prior \nexperience with the company\u2019s offering, which can be as current customers, competitors\u2019 cus -\ntomers, or new-to-the-category customers. Behavior factors also categorize customers by the \nfrequency with which they purchase the offering, the quantity they purchase, their price sensi -\ntivity and sensitivity to the company\u2019s promotional activities, their loyalty, their online versus \noffline purchases, and the retail outlets they patronize most often. Other behavioral factors of \ninterest are customers\u2019 role in the decision process (e.g., as initiator, influencer, decider, buyer, \nor user), and what stage of the customer decision journey they are in. Behavioral factors can also \ninclude the manner in which customers learn about new products, how they socialize, and what \nthey do in their spare time.\n\u2022 Psychographic factors  involve aspects of an individual\u2019s personality\u2014such as attitudes, value \nsystem, interests, and lifestyle. Psychographics link observable and unobservable characteristics \nof target customers, which is where they differ from demographic, geographic, and behavioral \nfactors. Whereas values, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles can be established by directly question -\ning customers, psychographic factors often are not readily discernable and must be inferred from \nthe observable characteristics and behavior of customers. A customer\u2019s interest in sports, which is \na psychographic factor, can be confirmed by behaviors such as subscribing to sports magazines, \nviewing sports programming, membership in a tennis club, and the purchase of sports equipment \nand tickets to sports events.\nThe importance of psychographics, like that of geolocation factors, has been sharpened by the \nproliferating use of online communication and e-commerce, which have made the moral values, atti -\ntudes, interests, and lifestyles of customers more transparent to companies. Social media companies \nsuch as Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter can construct actionable psychographic customer \nprofiles from the demographic, geographic, and behavioral data of their customers.

Although strategic targeting\u2019s focus on creating market value is crucial \nto the success of the company\u2019s offering, it has an important disadvantage: Value is not observable, \nwhich means it cannot readily be acted on to reach target customers. Tactical targeting addresses this \nshortcoming by identifying the demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral charac -\nteristics of strategically selected target customers so that the company can reach out to them. Thus, \nstrategic and tactical targeting are complementary and inseparable facets of the process of identifying \ntarget customers.\nAn example of this process is a company that decides to launch a new credit card with a loyalty \nprogram that rewards customers with travel benefits such as airline tickets and hotel stays. The com -\npany\u2019s strategically important customers are those who want a credit card and would appreciate the \ncard\u2019s travel benefits (customer value), would use the card frequently, and would not default on pay -\nments (company value). Because customer needs are unobservable, it is difficult to pinpoint those \nconsumers who might enjoy the travel benefits offered by the card. Also unobservable are customers\u2019 \nfuture use of the credit card and the likelihood that they will not default on paying for their purchases. \nIn addition to complicating the process of targeting attractive and compatible customer segments, \nthese unobservable characteristics make it harder for the company to effectively communicate with \nand deliver the card to target customers.\nSolving this dilemma entails linking the value-based customer segment with the observable char -\nacteristics of customers in this segment. To identify customers who would probably use the card often \nwithout defaulting on payments, the company might consider customers\u2019 credit scores, demograph -\nics, and geolocation, as well as their purchase behavior, including buying patterns, type and quantity \nof items purchased, and frequent payment by credit card. To identify those customers seeking travel \nrewards for whom it can create value, the company might look for customers who read travel maga -\nzines, watch travel shows, purchase luggage, frequent online travel sites, and seek the help of travel \nagents. Thus, the company might use travel-related communication channels to promote its new card \nand its offerings. By focusing on customers with profiles that are aligned with the value-based target \nsegment, a company can optimize its targeting activities.\nTo achieve optimal outcomes when evaluating the company\u2019s tactical targeting options, marketing \nmanagers should follow the two main principles of tactical targeting: effectiveness  and cost efficiency . The \neffectiveness principle reflects the degree to which the company is able to reach all strategically viable \ncustomers whose needs can be fulfilled in a way that benefits the company and its collaborators, make \nthem aware of the company\u2019s offering, and give them access to the offering. The cost-efficiency principle \nmandates that the company\u2019s communication and distribution reach only the customers it has targeted. \nThe goal of the cost-efficiency principle is to curtail the waste of resources on customers whose needs \nthe company\u2019s offering cannot effectively address and who are unable to create value for the company.11\nBRINGING TARGET SEGMENTS TO LIFE WITH PERSONAS\nTo bring all their acquired information and insights to life, some researchers develop personas. \n Personas  are detailed profiles of one, or perhaps a few, hypothetical target consumers, imagined \nin terms of demographic, psychographic, geographic, or other descriptive attitudinal or behavioral \ninformation. Photos, images, names, or short bios help convey how the target customer looks, acts, \nand feels so that marketers can incorporate a well-defined target-customer point of view in all their \nmarketing decision making. Many software companies have used \u201cpersonas\u201d to help improve user \ninterfaces and experiences, and marketers have broadened the application. For example:\nUnilever\u2019s biggest and most successful hair care launch, for Sunsilk, was aided by insights \ninto the target consumer the company dubbed \u201cKatie.\u201d The Katie persona personified the \n20-something female\u2019s hair care needs along with her perceptions and attitudes and the way \nshe dealt with her everyday \u201cdramas.\u201d\nSpecialty tool and equipment maker Campbell Hausfeld relied on the many retailers it sup -\nplied, including Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, to help it keep in touch with consumers. After \ndeveloping eight consumer profiles, including a female do-it-yourselfer and an elderly con -\nsumer, the firm was able to successfully launch new products such as drills that weighed less \nor that included a level for picture hanging.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5063, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4065c600-f045-46e0-b919-9cb410a9500e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4065c600-f045-46e0-b919-9cb410a9500e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49090157-c35d-45f5-ac8e-6b03e6f6af34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "51d11912508de0d06f7600f29cfd58c132c6bb05a580289052b19eaa390328e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de189fa7-a197-4a75-bb13-957e130a095a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "16e0fec78f1de90fbee4ad6473a7360bc503a26abcc91d97e72c6c02273847b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72e32ffc-d4e1-4a32-8615-2880041f48c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e60e7a02dadfdbe04b45a57d9e5e30b630b7784db488fe2beb84523749fa0349", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "126 PART  3   |  DEVELOPING A VIABLE MARKET STRATEGY\nAlthough personas provide vivid information to aid marketing decision making, it\u2019s important not \nto overgeneralize. Any target market may have a range of consumers who vary along a number of key \ndimensions, so marketers often account for these differences by developing multiple personas, each \nreflecting the characteristics of a particular consumer segment. Using quantitative, qualitative, and \nobservational research, Best Buy developed five customer personas to guide the redesign and relaunch \nof GeekSquad.com, its national computer-support service: \u201cJill\u201d\u2014a suburban mom who uses her com -\nputer daily and depends on the Geek Squad as on a landscaper or plumber; \u201cCharlie\u201d\u2014a 50-plus male \nwho is curious about technology but needs an unintimidating guide; \u201cDaryl\u201d\u2014a technologically savvy, \nhands-on experimenter who occasionally needs a helping hand; \u201cLuis\u201d\u2014a time-pressed small business \nowner whose primary goal is to complete tasks as expediently as possible; \u201cNick\u201d\u2014a prospective Geek \nSquad agent who views the site critically and needs to be challenged.\nClearly, the customer persona does not represent all target customers. Characterizing the target \nsegment with a representative individual, however, makes it easier to visualize the company\u2019s target \ncustomers and better understand how likely they are to respond to the company\u2019s offering.12\nSingle-Segment and Multi-Segment \nTargeting\nThe discussion so far has focused on a scenario in which a firm identifies and targets a single customer \nsegment. Single-segment marketing, however, is the exception rather than the rule. Most offerings \nexist as part of a product line, with different offerings targeting different customer segments. Single-\nsegment and multi-segment targeting, as well as the key principles underlying the decision to target \nmultiple segments, are discussed in the following sections.\nSINGLE-SEGMENT TARGETING\nWith single-segment concentration, the firm markets to only one particular segment. Porsche con -\ncentrates on the sports car enthusiast and Volkswagen on the small-car market; its foray into the \nlarge-car market with the Phaeton was a failure in the United States. Through concentrated marketing, \na firm gains deep knowledge of the segment\u2019s needs and achieves a strong market presence. It also \nenjoys operating economies by specializing its production, distribution, and promotion.\nCompanies targeting single segments often focus on smaller, well-defined groups of customers \nthat seek a distinctive mix of benefits. For example, whereas Hertz, Avis, Alamo, and others special -\nize in airport rental cars for business and leisure travelers, Enterprise has focused on the low-budget, \ninsurance-replacement market by primarily renting to customers whose cars have been wrecked or \nstolen. By offering low cost and convenience in an overlooked niche market, Enterprise has been highly \nprofitable. Another up-and-coming niche marketer is Allegiant Air.\nAllegiant Air  When the prolonged recession that began in 2008 wreaked havoc on the \nfinancial performance of all the major u.S. domestic airlines, up-and-comer Allegiant Air managed \nto turn a profit quarter after quarter. founded in Eugene, OR, in 2007, Allegiant has developed \na highly successful niche strategy by providing leisure travelers with affordable nonstop flights \nfrom smaller markets such as Great falls, MT; Grand forks, ND; Knoxville, TN; and Plattsburgh, \nNY, to popular vacation spots in florida, California, and Hawaii and to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and \nMyrtle Beach. By staying off the beaten track, it avoids competition on all but a handful of its \n100-plus routes. Much of its passenger traffic is additive and incremental, attracting tourist travel \nthat might not otherwise have happened. If a market doesn\u2019t seem to be taking hold, Allegiant \nquickly drops it. The carrier carefully balances revenues and costs. It charges for services\u2014\nsuch as in-flight beverages and overhead storage space\u2014that are free on other airlines. It also \ngenerates additional revenue by cross-selling vacation products and packages. Allegiant owns \nits 64 used MD-80 planes and also cuts costs by flying to specific destinations only a few times \na week, instead of a few times a day like most airlines. It even fixes its seats at a pitch halfway \nbetween fully upright and fully reclined, because adjustable seats add weight, burn fuel, and are a \n\u201cmaintenance nightmare.\u201d13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4493, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72e32ffc-d4e1-4a32-8615-2880041f48c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "72e32ffc-d4e1-4a32-8615-2880041f48c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c82989ea-840b-42fc-b17f-b54213804580", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "6baa707ecea152fec93446f94a93badf4baf3b73517c32f7ed5fe07a02030c6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4065c600-f045-46e0-b919-9cb410a9500e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "51d11912508de0d06f7600f29cfd58c132c6bb05a580289052b19eaa390328e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "70b7632e-8b37-48c3-ad5e-74d4989c9c87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4d002902a226f6d14aee3a1d4e052609874bed5a43e7af5771704e8e547e808", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 6    |  IDENTI fYING  MARKET  SEGMENTS  AND  TARGET  CuSTOMERS  127\nWhat does an attractive niche segment look like? Niche customers have a distinct set of needs; \nthey will pay a premium to the firm that best satisfies them. The niche market is fairly small but has \nsize, profit, and growth potential. It also is unlikely to attract many competitors, and it gains certain \neconomies through specialization. As marketing efficiency increases, niches that seemed too small \nmay become more profitable.\nTARGETING MULTIPLE SEGMENTS\nAs markets become more fragmented, an increasing number of companies develop offerings target -\ning a greater number of smaller customer segments. Even companies that start with a single offering \naimed at a specific target market achieve wider customer adoption over time. As their customer base \nbecomes more diverse, these companies transition from a single offering to a product line containing \nofferings that fit the needs of the diverse customers it serves.\nThe process of identifying multiple customer segments is similar to that of identifying a single \ncustomer segment, the main difference being that the targeting analysis yields several viable segments. \nThus, a direct consequence of the decision to target multiple customer segments is the need to develop \nunique offerings that satisfy the disparate requirements of each segment. Indeed, because different cus -\ntomer segments vary in their needs and in the value they can create for the company, the company must \ndevelop a portfolio of offerings that address these distinct needs in a way that benefits the company.\nWith selective specialization, a firm selects a subset of all the possible segments, each objectively \nattractive and appropriate. There may be little or no synergy among the segments, but each segment \npromises to be a moneymaker. When Procter & Gamble launched Crest Whitestrips, for example, \ninitial target segments included newly engaged women and brides-to-be, as well as gay males. The \nmulti-segment strategy also has the advantage of minimizing the firm\u2019s risk by diversifying its offerings \nacross different customer segments.\nA firm can increase the appeal of its offerings to target customers by focusing on different prod -\nucts and/or markets. With product specialization , the firm sells a certain product to several different \nmarket segments. A microscope manufacturer, for instance, sells to university, government, and com -\nmercial laboratories, making different instruments for each and building a strong reputation in the \nspecific product area. The downside risk is that the product may be supplanted by an entirely new \ntechnology. With market specialization , on the other hand, the firm concentrates on serving many needs \nof a particular customer group, such as by selling an assortment of products only to university labo -\nratories. The firm gains a strong reputation among this customer group and becomes a channel for \nadditional products its members can use. A firm that excels in developing differentiated products of \nits target customers is Hallmark Cards.<< While major u.S. \nairlines suffered during \nthe recession that began \nin 2008, Oregon-based \nAllegiant Air stayed \nprofitable with a niche \nstrategy that offered \naffordable nonstop \nflights from smaller \nmarkets to popular \nvacation spots, skirting \nthe competition and \nattracting customers \nwho otherwise might not \nhave traveled at all.\nSource: Michael Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo\nHallmark  Hallmark\u2019s personal expression products are sold in more than 40,000 retail  \noutlets nationwide and in 100 countries worldwide.

Another is that they\u2019re easy to measure. \nEven when we describe the target market in non-demographic terms (say, by personality type), we \nmay need to link back to demographic characteristics in order to estimate the size of the market and \nthe media we should use to reach it efficiently.\nHere\u2019s how marketers have used certain demographic variables to segment markets.\nAge.  Marketers often group customers based on their age into different generations. For example, \none of the commonly used demographic factors is that of generation, such as the Silent Generation \n(1925\u20131945); Baby Boomers (1946\u20131964); Generation X (1965\u20131981); Generation Y, also referred to \nas Millennials (1982\u20132000); and Generation Z (2001\u2013present). Each generation  is profoundly influenced \nby the times in which it grows up\u2014the music, movies, politics, and defining events of that period. \nMembers share the same major cultural, political, and economic experiences and often have similar \noutlooks and values. Marketers may choose to advertise to a cohort by using the icons and images \nprominent in its experiences. They can also try to develop products and services that uniquely meet \nthe particular interests or needs of a generational target.\nFor example, nutrition supplement companies develop different products based on consumers\u2019 \nage. Centrum\u2014a brand of multivitamins produced by Pfizer\u2014markets two different types of vitamins: \nCentrum Adults that targets adult men and women and Centrum Silver Adults that is designed for \nadults 50+. Centrum Silver Adults contains multivitamins that are age adjusted with a broad spectrum \nof micronutrients that help support the health of older adults. Other age-specific products include \ndiapers, baby foods, college loans, and retirement communities.\nStage in the Life Cycle.  People in the same part of the life cycle may still differ in their life \nstage. Life stage reflects a person\u2019s major concern, such as going through a divorce, entering a sec -\nond marriage, taking care of an older parent, deciding to cohabit with another person, and buying a \nnew home. These life stages present opportunities for marketers who can help people cope with the \naccompanying decisions.\nFor example, the wedding industry attracts marketers of a vast range of products and services. It\u2019s \nno surprise that the average U.S. couple spends close to $40,000 on their wedding.15 Marketers know \nmarriage often means that two sets of shopping habits and brand preferences must be blended into \none. Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Colgate-Palmolive include their products in \u201cNewlywed Kits,\u201d \ndistributed to couples applying for a marriage license.

One Yahoo survey found that more than \nhalf of men identified themselves as the primary grocery shoppers in \ntheir households. Procter & Gamble now designs some ads with men \nin mind, such as ads for Gain and Tide laundry detergents, Febreze \nair freshener, and Swiffer sweepers. On the flip side, according to \nsome studies, women in the United States and the United Kingdom \nmake 75 percent of decisions about buying new homes and purchase  \n60 percent of new cars.19\nNevertheless, gender differentiation has long been applied in \nclothing, hairstyling, and cosmetics categories. Avon, for one, has \nbuilt a $6 billion-plus business by selling beauty products to women. \nGillette has found similar success with its Venus razor. More recently, \nhowever, a number of companies have begun to question the value of \ngender differentiation and eliminate gender traits from their products \nin response to consumers\u2019 skepticism about the benefit of gender-\ndifferentiated products. For example, Bic introduced Made For YOU, \na line of genderless razors and grooming products, joining compa -\nnies like Non Gender Specific, A\u0113sop, and MALIN+GOETZ that offer \ngender-neutral skin care products.20\n>> Extensive consumer \nresearch and market \ntesting of a razor crafted \nto meet the unique shav-\ning needs of women \nresulted in Gillette\u2019s \nVenus razor garnering \nmore than 50 percent of \nthe global female shav-\ning market. \nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky/Alamy Stock Photo\nIncome.  Income segmentation is a long-standing practice in such categories as automobiles, clothing, \ncosmetics, financial services, and travel. However, income does not always predict the best customers \nfor a given product. Despite the high price of early color television sets, blue-collar workers were among \nthe first to purchase them; it was cheaper for them to buy a television than go to movies and restaurants.\nMany marketers are deliberately going after lower-income groups, in some cases discovering fewer \ncompetitive pressures or greater consumer loyalty. Procter & Gamble launched two discount-priced \nbrand extensions in 2005\u2014Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic\u2014which have met with some success. \nOther marketers are finding success with premium-priced products. When Whirlpool launched its \npricey Duet washer line, sales were double their forecasts in a weak economy, thanks primarily to \nmiddle-class shoppers who traded up.\nIncreasingly, companies are finding their markets are hourglass-shaped, as middle-market U.S. \nconsumers migrate toward both discount and premium products. Companies that miss out on this new \nmarket risk being \u201ctrapped in the middle\u201d and seeing their market share steadily decline. After recog -\nnizing that its channel strategy emphasized retailers like Sears selling primarily to the middle class, \nLevi-Strauss introduced premium lines such as Levi\u2019s Made & Crafted to upscale retailers Bloomingda -\nles and Saks Fifth Avenue, and the less-expensive Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. line to mass market \nretailers Walmart and Target.Venus Razor  Gillette\u2019s Venus razor has become the most \nsuccessful women\u2019s shaving line ever\u2014holding more than 50 \npercent of the global women\u2019s shaving market\u2014as a result of \ninsightful consumer research and extensive market testing of \nproduct design, packaging, and advertising. The razor was a \nmarked departure from earlier designs, which had essentially \nbeen colored or repackaged versions of men\u2019s razors. Venus \nwas designed specifically to meet women\u2019s needs. Extensive research identified unique shaving \nneeds for women, including a shaving surface that is nine times greater than the male face, as well \nas shaving in a wet environment and across the curves of the female body. The resulting design \nincluded an oval shaped cartridge to better fit into tight areas like underarms and the bikini area \nand additional lubrication for better glide. furthermore, after discovering that women change their \ngrip on a razor about 30 times during each shaving session, Gillette designed the Venus razor with \na wide, sculpted, rubberized handle offering superior grip and control. It also commissioned Harris \nInteractive (now Harris Insights & Analytics) to conduct an online study among more than 6,500 \nwomen in 13 countries that found seven of 10\u00a0wanted so-called goddess skin, defined as smooth \n(68 percent), healthy (66 percent), and soft (61 percent), leading to the introduction of the new \nGillette Venus & Olay razor.21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4616, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a512e0b-c8fa-46cd-a4d3-44553be663c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a512e0b-c8fa-46cd-a4d3-44553be663c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6648613f-22f5-4b82-bd87-bfd40ac4ac6d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "c6782511e47e528fc9bc0283fe9a6b31cfe8c5ace9d55f5c31f1fe9a8709f51e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05fc2136-592a-4b62-93ca-3a7bb6f8af61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "1c41646d1899863674c32e4810aaa5ef069fc3028ad406ab2f01d6b38f4d85c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68e92970-362d-4ae5-9ccf-a8a69982a6e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50e94c2851401d0ebfe6756460ace1d80b0df3912476298a6b7d73558e7a3583", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 6    |  IDENTI fYING  MARKET  SEGMENTS  AND  TARGET  CuSTOMERS  131\nRace and Culture.  Multicultural marketing reflects awareness that different ethnic and cultural \nsegments have sufficiently different needs and wants to require targeted marketing activities and that a \nmass market approach is not refined enough for the diversity of the marketplace. Consider that McDon -\nald\u2019s generates a significant share of its U.S. revenues with ethnic minorities. A recent survey showed \nthat 25 percent of African American respondents, 24 percent of respondents of Hispanic origin, and \n20 percent of Asian American respondents stated that McDonald\u2019s is the fast-food restaurant they eat \nat most often. The company\u2019s highly successful \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d campaign was rooted in hip-hop culture \nbut has had an appeal that transcended race and ethnicity.22\nThe Hispanic American, African American, and Asian American markets and their numerous \nsubmarkets are growing at two to three times the rate of non-multicultural populations, and their buy -\ning power is expanding. Multicultural consumers also vary in whether they are first, second, or a later \ngeneration and whether they are immigrants or were born and raised in the United States. Accordingly, \nmarketers need to factor the norms, language nuances, buying habits, and business practices of multi -\ncultural markets into the initial formulation of their marketing strategy rather than adding these as an \nafterthought. All this diversity also has implications for marketing research; it takes careful sampling \nto adequately profile target markets.\nMulticultural marketing can require different marketing messages, media, channels, and so on. \nSpecialized media exist to reach virtually any cultural segment or minority group, although some \ncompanies have struggled to provide financial and management support for fully realized programs. \nFortunately, as countries become more culturally diverse, many marketing campaigns targeting a spe -\ncific cultural group can spill over and positively influence others. To launch its new Explorer model, \nFord developed a TV ad featuring comedian Kevin Hart that initially targeted the African American \nmarket, but it also became one of the key ads for the general market launch.23\nGEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION\nGeographic segmentation  divides the market into geographic units such as nations, states, regions, \ncounties, cities, or neighborhoods. The company can operate in one or a few areas, or it can operate \nin all areas while heeding local variations. In that way, it can tailor marketing programs to the needs \nand wants of local customer groups in trading areas and neighborhoods, and it can even cater to the \nneeds of individual customers. Going online to reach customers in a particular geographic location \ncan open a host of local opportunities, as Yelp has found out.\nYelp founded in 2004, Yelp.com wants to \u201cconnect people with great local businesses\u201d by \ntargeting consumers who seek or want to share reviews of local businesses. Almost two-thirds of \nthe website\u2019s millions of vetted online reviews are for restaurants and retailers. Yelp was launched \nin San francisco, where monthly parties with preferred users evolved into a formal program, Yelp \nElite, now used to launch the service in new cities. The company\u2019s mobile app allows it to bypass \nthe internet and connect with consumers directly; more than half of searches on the site now come \nfrom its mobile platform. Yelp generates revenue by selling designated Yelp Ads to local merchants \nvia hundreds of salespeople. The local advertising business is massive, with digital ads overtaking \ntraditional ads in local markets. Local businesses also benefit from Yelp: Several research studies have \ndemonstrated the potential revenue payback from having reviews of their businesses on the site.24\nRegional differences matter. Consider the following facts: People in Salt Lake City (and Utah) eat \nthe most Jell-O; Long Beach, CA, residents eat the most ice cream; and New York City dwellers buy \nthe most country music CDs.25 Regional marketing increasingly means marketing right down to a \nspecific zip code.

Geoclustering seg -\nmentations such as PRIZM have been used to answer a variety of questions: Which neighborhoods \nor zip codes contain our most valuable customers? How deeply have we already penetrated these seg -\nments? Which distribution channels and promotional media work best in reaching our target clusters \nin each area? By mapping the densest areas, the retailer can rely on customer cloning,  assuming the best \nprospects live where most of the customers already come from.\nBEHAVIORAL SEGMENTATION\nIn behavioral segmentation , marketers divide buyers into groups on the basis of their actions. Many \nmarketers believe variables related to users or their usage\u2014user status, usage rate, buyer-readiness \nstage, loyalty status, and occasions\u2014are good starting points for constructing market segments.\n\u2022 User status.  Based on their prior experience with the company\u2019s offering, consumers can be clas -\nsified into nonusers, potential users, first-time users, regular users, and ex-users. Understanding \ncustomers\u2019 experience with the company is important because different types of experience tend \nto require different marketing strategies. Included in the potential-user group are consumers who \nwill become users in connection with some life stage or event; for example, mothers-to-be are \npotential users who will turn into heavy users. The key to attracting potential users, or possibly \neven nonusers, is understanding the reasons why they are not using. Do they have deeply held \nattitudes, beliefs, or behaviors? Or do they just lack knowledge of the product or brand benefits?\n\u2022 Usage rate.  We can segment markets into light, medium, and heavy product users. Heavy users \noften are a small slice but account for a high percentage of total consumption. Heavy beer drinkers \naccount for 87 percent of beer consumption\u2014almost seven times as much as light drinkers. Many \nmarketers would rather attract one heavy user than several light users. A potential problem, how -\never, is that heavy users often are either extremely loyal to one brand or never loyal to any brand and \nalways looking for the lowest price. They may also have less capacity to expand their purchasing and \nconsumption. Light users, on the other hand, may be more responsive to new marketing appeals.27\n\u2022 Buyer-readiness stage.  Some people are unaware of the product, some are aware, some are \ninformed, some are interested, some desire the product, and some intend to buy. To help char -\nacterize how many people are at different stages and how well they have converted people from \none stage to another, marketers break the market into buyer-readiness stages. The proportions \nof consumers at different stages have a significant effect on the design of a marketing program. \nSuppose a health agency wants to encourage women to have an annual Pap test to detect cervi -\ncal cancer. At\u00a0the beginning, most women may be unaware of the Pap test. The marketing effort \nshould launch awareness-building advertising using a simple message. Later, the advertising >> Local advertising \nallows Yelp.com or \nthe Yelp app to share \nmillions of reviews from \ncustomers who want to \nrelate their experiences \nwith local businesses \nwith those who are \nlooking for specific \nservices and products \nsuch as restaurants and \nretailers.\nSource: bigtunaonline/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4f6a0c7-16f1-4d63-9e1d-47814b6ac18d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4f6a0c7-16f1-4d63-9e1d-47814b6ac18d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1dc01796-005f-42c2-ad9d-c7696d7f0b32", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "ac985448bb2650e98fde71eeeb0e7e27adcc63c98bcb31c78f63fc09d2b28440", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e88841ea-cc98-44fd-bfbe-0f8b019574ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap6.pdf"}, "hash": "494c61d44ba24756d4010731d61e540c48ef630819a7e5fe7dda3d5d24f7d4e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31da318a-9e37-4c7e-9c7f-3ea45301bce2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a23c4e28d7d2cc0499531c2fab4599430bd2c6a3d72194f30f461d949d9cc820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 6    |  IDENTI fYING  MARKET  SEGMENTS  AND  TARGET  CuSTOMERS  133\nshould dramatize the benefits of the Pap test and the risks of not getting it.

Consumers are inspired by one of three primary motivations:  \nideals, achievement, and self-expression. Those primarily motivated by ideals are guided by knowledge \nand principles. Those motivated by achievement look for products and services that demonstrate suc -\ncess to their peers. Consumers whose motivation is self-expression desire social or physical activity, \nvariety, and risk. Personality traits such as energy, self-confidence, intellectualism, novelty seeking, inno -\nvativeness, impulsiveness, leadership, and vanity\u2014in conjunction with key demographics\u2014  determine \nan individual\u2019s resources. Different levels of resources enhance or constrain a person\u2019s expression of  \nher or his primary motivation.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) market is estimated to make up \naround 7 percent of the population and to have approximately $917 billion in buying power.31 More \nthan 75 percent of LGBT adults and their friends, family, and relatives say they would switch to brands \nthat are known to be LGBT friendly. Many firms have recently created initiatives to target this mar -\nket. American Airlines created a Rainbow Team with a dedicated LGBT staff and a website that has \nemphasized community-relevant services such as a calendar of gay- and lesbian-themed national \nevents. Volvo, Nike, Kimpton, AT&T, Target, P&G, General Mills, and Kraft are also often identified as \namong the most gay- and lesbian-friendly businesses. Hyatt\u2019s online appeals to the LGBT community \ntarget social sites and blogs where customers share their travel experiences. Some firms worry about \nbacklash from organizations that criticize or even boycott firms supporting gay and lesbian causes. \nAlthough Pepsi, Campbell, and Wells Fargo all experienced such boycotts in the past, they continue \nto advertise to the gay and lesbian communities.\nSegmenting Business Markets\nWe can segment business markets with some of the same variables that we use in consumer  markets\u2014\nfor example, geography, benefits sought, and usage rate\u2014but business marketers also use other vari -\nables.

To identify \nbusinesses that operated in financially attractive sectors and would be most likely to value its \nofferings, it conducted an extensive market study and discovered that some customers generated \na lot of business but offered little profit potential, whereas for others the opposite was true. As \na result, Timken shifted its attention away from the auto industry and into the heavy-processing, \naerospace, and defense industries. It also addressed customers that were financially unattractive \nor minimally attractive. A tractor manufacturer complained that Timken\u2019s bearings prices were too \nhigh for its medium-sized tractors.

Larger companies have benefited from the long \ntail by being able to offer increasingly varied products \nthat remain viable even at relatively low sales volumes. \nAnd thanks to the lower costs of designing, communi -\ncating, and delivering their offerings, smaller companies \nhave benefited by being able to enter the market with \nproducts that cater to niche tastes. Still, not every market \nhas been transformed by the long tail. In categories that \ninvolve highly complex production or very high inventory \ncosts, offerings remain limited. for example, the automo -\ntive, aircraft, and shipbuilding industries remain largely \nreliant on a relatively small number of mass-produced \nofferings, each serving larger customer segments.\nSome critics challenge the notion that old business \nparadigms have changed as much as Anderson suggests. \nEspecially in entertainment, they say, the \u201chead\u201d where \nhits are concentrated is valuable not only to the content \ncreators but also to consumers. One critique argued that \n\u201cmost hits are popular because they are of high quality,\u201d \nand another noted that the majority of products and ser -\nvices making up the long tail originate from a small con-\ncentration of online \u201clong-tail aggregators.\u201d\nAlthough some academic research supports the long-\ntail theory, other research is more challenging, finding that \npoor recommendation systems render many very-low-share \nproducts in the tail so obscure and hard to find that they \ndisappear before they can be purchased frequently enough \nto justify their existence. for companies selling physical \nproducts, the inventory, stocking, and handling costs can \noutweigh any financial benefits of such products.34The advent of online commerce, made possible by tech-\nnology and epitomized by Amazon.com, eBay, iTunes, \nand Netflix, has led to a shift in consumer buying patterns, \naccording to Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired  \nmagazine and author of The Long Tail .\nIn most markets, the distribution of product sales con -\nforms to a curve weighted heavily to one side\u2014the \u201chead\u201d\u2014\nwhere the bulk of sales are generated by a few products. \nThe curve falls rapidly toward zero and hovers just above it \nfar along the X-axis\u2014the \u201clong tail\u201d\u2014where the vast major -\nity of products generate very little sales.

By the end of the \nyear, over 905 of Sapphire cardholders reported overall sat-\nisfaction with the card, and 85 percent indicated they would \nrecommend it to others.\nBuilding on the success of Sapphire, Chase introduced \na new card called the Chase Sapphire Preferred in 2011 to \nobtain a larger share of the affluent market. This new card \nhad an annual fee of $95 but offered cardholders 50,000 \npoints if they spent over $4,000 in the first three months. Pre-\nferred cardholders also enjoyed better points-per-dollar con-\nversion rates on dining and travel and could redeem points \nfor exclusive events called Chase Experiences. unlike most \ncredit cards at the time, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card \nhad a metal core between the two plates of plastic, making \nit heavier and more substantial. Customers reported that the \ncard made a satisfying \u201cthunk\u201d when placed down for pay-\nment, giving the card a unique identity.\nThe cornerstone of the Chase Sapphire portfolio, the \nSapphire Reserve card, came about when further research \nshowed that a portion of consumers within the affluent seg-\nment, mainly 25- to 44-year-olds with incomes of more than \n$150,000, heavily prioritized travel benefits and utilized point \nrewards. Chase not only had to design its new card to dis-\ntinguish it from the Sapphire Preferred card but also had to \nappeal to Millennials and deter the behavior of those it called \n\u201cchurners.\u201d By 2013, many Millennials were careful about \napplying for new credit cards because of the significant stu-\ndent loan debt they had amassed. However, Chase found \nthat Millennials were also attracted by reward systems and \nthat a substantial enough incentive could change their atti-\ntude. Churners were those who signed up for multiple credit \ncards to take advantage of sign-on bonuses and low intro-\nductory rates; these credit cards would often go unused after \nthe rewards were spent.\nThe new Chase Sapphire Reserve card was launched  \nin August 2016. It carried a $450 annual fee, offered  \n3 points per dollar spent on travel and dining, a greater \npoints-per-dollar conversion rate toward travel, annual travel Chase Sapphire\nChase Bank, a commercial and consumer banking subsidiary \nof the largest u.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, offers services \nsuch as personal banking, credit cards, mortgages, and \nauto financing.

Serving nearly half of u.S. households, Chase \nBank has over 93 million cardholders and 5000 branches \nnationwide.\nIn 2006, Chase Bank initiated a substantial market \nresearch project in order to strengthen its credit card opera-\ntions. The project focused on deeply understanding the \nvarious consumer segments in the credit card market. When \nsegmenting the market, credit card companies often use \ntwo types of demographics: age group and asset amount. \nIn addition, credit cards are differentiated by factors such as \nthe annual fee, rewards such as cash back and proprietary \nrewards (points), and factors such as interest rates, credit \nlines, and creditworthiness. Chase\u2019s market research project \nshowed that competing in the affluent customer segment of \nthe consumer credit card market would be valuable in build-\ning a stronger presence for the company. According to the \nresearch, this demographic represented 15 percent of u.S. \ncardholders at the time but generated over 50 percent of total \ncredit card spending.\nIn 2009, Chase Bank introduced five primary sub-brands \nin its credit card portfolio to address different market seg-\nments. These included JP Morgan for private banking cus-\ntomers, Chase Sapphire for affluent consumers, Chase Ink \nfor small business owners, Chase freedom for consumers \nwho prioritized cash back, and Chase Slate for consum-\ners focused on paying off credit card debt.
