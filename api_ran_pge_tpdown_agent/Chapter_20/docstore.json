Company has experienced a \nmassive global transformation. In 1999 its new chairman, Mong-Koo Chung, declared that Hyundai \nwould focus not on volume and market share but on quality. The company began to benchmark \nindustry leader Toyota, adopted Six Sigma processes, organized product development cross-\nfunctionally, partnered more closely with suppliers, and increased quality-oversight meetings. From \na place near the bottom of J. D. Power\u2019s study of U.S. new-vehicle quality in 2001\u2014ranking 32nd of \n37 brands\u2014Hyundai\u2019s luxury brand Genesis zoomed to number 1 by 2018. Hyundai also transformed \nits marketing. Its groundbreaking 10-year warranty sent a strong signal of reliability and quality, and Countries are increasingly multicultural, and products and services developed in one country are \nfinding wide acceptance in others. Consider the globalization of the auto industry. According \nto a J. D. Power study, vehicles in the 2018 study were manufactured in 25 countries, 11 of which \nweren\u2019t present in the study five years ago. Those 11 new homes to auto manufacturing were Brazil, \nChina, Finland, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey.1 Consider, \nfor example, the rapid ascent of Hyundai.Tapping into Global Markets20\nRefocusing from \nvolume and market \nshare to quality, \nbacked by a \ngroundbreaking \nwarranty, \ntransformed the \nimage of Hyundai \nMotor Company.\nSource: VDWI Automotive/\nAlamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1538, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d913f37-8321-4a4a-98e9-c75fbb037a18": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d913f37-8321-4a4a-98e9-c75fbb037a18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fb4c955c-4e40-41ae-b5bf-2c9a11e75b7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "cfdc68a70de75c0ef254239c8ada160baa9843e7959226aa4cdcb4a0152dc391", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce642d67-df67-476b-9582-a69a26cccca8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "720a405553ae0d358cddcd0e123d85f01c28dc5abd8edc3c3be065b615479241", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a31c3e24-e6f1-4fdd-a2e6-3e95aa37946b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7fb0afbc32f31d51558f0b928a6f30910cd52c5dd0f763e5a89f4346aec39fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "443\nPART 7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\n20.1  Explain how companies decide whether to go \nabroad.\n20.2  Discuss the factors that companies consider in \ndeciding which global markets to enter.20.3  Summarize the strategies companies use to \nenter global markets.\n20.4  Explain how companies can adapt their \nmarketing strategies for global markets.more consumers began to appreciate the value its stylish cars had to offer. The U.S. market was not \nthe only one receiving attention from Hyundai and its younger, more affordable brand sibling, Kia \n(in which Hyundai is a minority shareholder). Hyundai vehicles are sold in over 200 countries. The \ncompany employs more than 110,000 people around the globe and has manufacturing and research \nfacilities worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, China, Brazil, Germany, the Czech \nRepublic, Russia, and Egypt. Hyundai\u2019s new motto, \u201cExplore the Possibilities, \u201d captures the company\u2019s \nambition for innovation on a global scale.2\nAlthough opportunities to compete in international markets are significant, the risks can be high. \nCompanies selling in global industries have no choice, however, but to internationalize their opera -\ntions. In this chapter, we review the major decisions involved in expanding into global markets.\nDeciding Whether to Go Abroad\nU.S. retailers such as The Limited and Gap have become globally prominent. Dutch retailer Ahold \nand Belgian retailer Delhaize earn almost two-thirds and three-quarters of their sales, respectively, \nin nondomestic markets. Foreign-based global retailers in the United States include Italy\u2019s Benetton, \nSweden\u2019s IKEA home furnishings stores, and Japan\u2019s UNIQLO casual apparel retailer.\nSeveral factors draw companies into the international arena. First, certain international markets \nmight present better profit opportunities than the domestic market. Second, a company might need \na larger customer base to achieve economies of scale. A company might also decide to go abroad to \nreduce its dependence on any one market. Another reason for going abroad could be a company\u2019s \ndesire to counterattack global competitors in their home markets. A company\u2019s decision to go abroad \nmight also stem from a its desire to be able to serve its global customers who require international \nservice.\nAs cultures blend across countries, another benefit of global expansion is the ability to transfer \nideas and products or services from one market into another.

These risks involve \nnot understanding the nuances of the foreign country\u2019s business culture and the intricacies of \nforeign regulations; lacking skilled managers with international experience; and having business \ndisrupted by commercial and political changes such as tariffs, currency fluctuations, and even a \ngovernment change leading to expropriation of foreign property.\nThe world\u2019s top three retailers\u2014U.S.-based Walmart, UK-based Tesco, and France-based \nCarrefour\u2014all have struggled to enter certain overseas markets.

Fresh & Easy\u2019s 200 or so stores were roughly 10,000 square feet (about one-fifth the \nsize of a standard U.S. supermarket but much bigger than a convenience store), with a focus on \nfresh-food offerings. Despite its significant investment, after five unprofitable years and more than \n$1.6 billion in losses, Tesco decided to exit the market in 2013. A host of problems plagued the \nretailer. Its U.S. customers were not accustomed to British-style ready meals, self-service cash \nregisters, and unorthodox store layouts. Other complaints were that the product range was too \nnarrow, there was no bakery, the flower department was underwhelming, and the stores were \nphysically too cold. The United States was not the only trouble spot for Tesco. The company had \nexited Japan the preceding year and was encountering difficulty in Central and Eastern Europe. \nWhile it focused on geographic expansion, its core supermarket business in the United Kingdom \nwas neglected. Stores weren\u2019t properly staffed, fresh food was not properly maintained, and \nnew private-label products were not introduced. The attempt to add non-grocery items such as \nclothing and electronics proved futile in a recession, and entry into new areas like banking and \ntelephony was a distraction. After enduring six consecutive quarters of same-store sales declines \nin its home market, Tesco announced a $1.7 billion program to refresh its UK stores and a pull-\nback of its global ambitions.5\n>> After less-than-\nsuccessful attempts to \nexpand into U.S. and \nother markets around \nthe world threatened its \nUK stores, Tesco scaled \nback its global ambitions \nand concentrated on \nrefurbishing its UK \noutlets.\nSource: Ian Dagnall/Alamy Stock PhotoThe problems that plagued Tesco in the United Kingdom are a common downside of overly \naggressive global expansion.

If the company has concluded that going abroad is indeed the best course of \naction, it must then make a set of more specific decisions, including which markets to enter, how to \nenter these markets, which specific marketing program to use for each market, and how to structure \nthe marketing organization in each country. These decisions are illustrated in Figure 20.1 and discussed \nin the following sections.\nDeciding Which Markets to Enter\nIn deciding to go abroad, the company needs to define its marketing objectives and policies. What \nratio of international sales to total sales will it seek? Most companies start small when they venture \nabroad. Some plan to stay small; others have bigger plans.\nDETERMINING HOW MANY MARKETS TO ENTER\nThe company must decide how many countries to enter and how fast to expand. Typical entry strate -\ngies are the waterfall  approach, gradually entering countries in sequence, and the sprinkler  approach, \nentering many countries simultaneously. Increasingly, firms\u2014especially technology-intensive firms \nand online ventures\u2014are born global and market to the entire world from the outset.\nMatsushita, BMW, General Electric, Benetton, and The Body Shop followed the waterfall approach, \nwhich allows firms to carefully plan expansion and is less likely to strain human and financial resources. \nBut when first-mover advantage is crucial and a high degree of competitive intensity prevails, the \nsprinkler approach is better. Apple, Gillette, and Unilever used the sprinkler approach for some of \ntheir products. The main risks in the sprinkler approach are the substantial resources needed and the \ndifficulty of planning entry strategies for many diverse markets.\nThe company must also choose what countries to enter based on the product and on factors such \nas geography, income, population, and political climate. Competitive considerations come into play \ntoo. It may make sense to go into markets where competitors have already entered to force them to \ndefend their market share, as well as to learn how they are marketing in that environment.\nA critical consideration, without question, is market growth. Getting a toehold in a fast-growing \nmarket can be a very attractive option, even if that market is likely to be crowded with more competi -\ntors soon. KFC has entered scores of countries as a pioneer by franchising its retail concept and making \nits marketing culturally relevant.FIGURE 20.1 \nMajor Decisions \nin International \nMarketing\nDeciding on\nthe marketing\norganization\nDeciding whether\nto go abroad\nDeciding which\nmarkets to\nenter\nDeciding how\nto enter the\nmarket\nDeciding on\nthe marketing\nprogram\nKFC KFC is one of the most recognizable quick-service restaurant brands in the world, with \nmore than 21,000 restaurants around the world.

One key factor is their physical \nproximity . Many companies prefer to sell to neighboring countries because they understand these \ncountries better and can control their entry costs more effectively. It\u2019s not surprising that the two \nlargest U.S. export markets are Canada and Mexico or that Swedish companies first sold to their \nScandinavian neighbors.\nAt other times, cultural proximity  determines choices. Given more familiar language, laws, and \nculture, many U.S. firms prefer to sell in Canada, England, and Australia rather than in larger markets \nsuch as Germany and France. Companies should be careful, however, when choosing markets according \nto cultural proximity. Besides overlooking potentially better markets, they may only superficially \nanalyze real differences that put them at a disadvantage.\nIt often makes sense to operate in fewer countries, with a deeper commitment and penetration \nin each. In general, companies show preference for countries that have high market attractiveness and \nlow market risk and in which they possess a competitive advantage.\nIn assessing potential markets, it may often be necessary to consider the benefits of engaging \nunderserved populations.\nConsider how the following companies successfully entered developing markets by pioneering \nways to serve \u201cinvisible\u201d consumers.7 Grameenphone marketed cell phones to 35,000 villages  \nin Bangladesh by hiring village women as agents who leased phone time to other villagers, one call \nat a time.

Supply \nchain problems have posed a different challenge in Africa, KFC\u2019s next growth target. Without a \ndomestic supply of chickens, the company had to import them, which is illegal in Nigeria and \nKenya. To overcome the supply problem in Nigeria, it added fish to the menu. As it moved into \nmore African markets, the company made sure to localize its menu\u2014selling Ugali, a type of \nporridge, in Kenya and jollof rice in Nigeria\u2014as well as to showcase local culture on store walls \nand in its advertising.6>> KFC has managed \nto surmount global \nexpansion challenges \nby tailoring its menu \nand advertising to the \nlogistical and cultural \nrequirements of specific \nlocations.\nSource: lou-Foto/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2834, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "223e20d6-e7cf-4596-9b12-d7220c9e1397": {"__data__": {"id_": "223e20d6-e7cf-4596-9b12-d7220c9e1397", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "571f78e5-9152-489a-913b-721d8d5e1660", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "6dcb142f538b88326c3e8f8486860fee69726cefd40cd659adc9ed6c5bbec3f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1a35d9e-a6fb-46f7-8b47-bb63722c26a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "03dd6c68edfc2fa0cddda80cecf18b16602b74a2472ce736556b33f4b6348385", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "22cd87df-f4bf-45f9-8c8e-b40bfbe892ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c57dbe29ee5eee660d5d8403972762666792792ae1f8ac5c202730d7a8ba6182", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 20    |  TAPPING  INTO  GlOBA l MARKETS  447\nCompanies may also want to take into account the positive impact that successful relationships \nwith collaborators can have when assessing markets.

Its broad choices are indirect exporting, direct exporting, licensing, joint ventures,  and direct investment,  \nas shown in Figure 20.2. Each succeeding strategy entails more commitment, risk, control, and profit \npotential.\nWhen going global, firms often start by working with an independent agent and entering a nearby \nor similar country. Later, the firm establishes an export department to manage its agent relationships. \nStill later, it replaces agents with its own sales subsidiaries in its larger export markets. This increases \ninvestment and risk but also enlarges earning potential. Next, to manage subsidiaries, the company \nreplaces the export department with an international department or division. If markets are large and \nstable, or if the host country requires local production, the company will locate production facilities \nthere. By this time, the firm is operating as a multinational and optimizing its sourcing, financing, \nmanufacturing, and marketing as a global organization.\nWe discuss the different options for entering foreign markets in the following sections.\nINDIRECT AND DIRECT EXPORT\nCompanies typically start with exporting, specifically indirect exporting \u2014that is, they work \nthrough independent intermediaries. There are three types of organizations that act as intermedi -\naries between a company and an international market: domestic-based export agents, cooperative \norganizations, and export-management companies. Domestic-based export merchants  buy the manufac -\nturer\u2019s products and then sell them abroad. Domestic-based export agents,  including trading companies, \nseek and negotiate foreign purchases for a commission. Cooperative organizations  conduct exporting \nactivities for several producers\u2014often of primary products such as fruits or nuts\u2014and are partly \nunder their administrative control. Export-management companies  agree to manage a company\u2019s export \nactivities for a fee.\nIndirect export has two advantages. First, there is less investment: The firm doesn\u2019t have to develop \nan export department, an overseas sales force, or a set of international contacts. Second, there\u2019s less \nrisk: Because international marketing intermediaries bring know-how and services to the relationship, \nthe seller will make fewer mistakes.\nCompanies may eventually decide to handle their own exports. The investment and risk are some -\nwhat greater, but so is the potential return. Direct exporting  happens in several ways. It may involve Deere & Company  Deere & Company (also referred to as John Deere), a manufacturer \nof agricultural, construction, and forestry machinery, dates back to 1937 when John Deere \nestablished the namesake company in Illinois. Initially focused on serving the U.S. market, \nthe company is now the largest agriculture machinery company in the world, employing over \n60,000\u00a0people worldwide. Its most popular products include various types of tractors, corn \npickers, sugarcane and cotton harvesters, mowers, and golf course equipment, along with \naccessories and associated services. John Deere\u2019s 8R line was the first tractor line designed to \naccommodate the needs of different farmers in 130 countries worldwide. The 8R is powerful but \nagile and fuel-efficient, best suited for larger farms. At the same time, it is highly customizable to \nsuit the needs of growers in developing markets like Brazil and Russia, as well as the developed \nmarkets of the United States or Germany.

Finally, exporting might involve home-country-based travel -\ning export sales representatives.\nMany companies use direct or indirect exporting to \u201ctest the waters\u201d before building a plant and \nmanufacturing their product overseas. A company does not necessarily have to attend international \ntrade shows if it can effectively use the internet to attract new customers overseas, support existing \ncustomers who live abroad, source from international suppliers, and build global brand awareness.\nSuccessful companies adapt their websites to provide country-specific content and services, ide -\nally in the local language, to international markets with the highest potential. Finding free information \nabout trade and exporting has never been easier. Export-promotion offices in many states also have \nonline resources and allow businesses to link to their sites.\nLICENSING\nLicensing  is a simple way to engage in international marketing. The licensor issues a license to a \nforeign company to use a manufacturing process, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other item of \nvalue for a fee or royalty. The licensor gains market entry at little risk; the licensee gains production \nexpertise and/or a well-known product or brand name.\nThe licensor, however, has less control over the licensee than over its own production and sales \nfacilities. If the licensee is very successful, the licensing firm has given up profits, and if and when the \ncontract ends, it might find it has created a competitor. To prevent this, the licensor usually supplies \nsome proprietary product ingredients or components (as Coca-Cola does with its syrup). Perhaps the \nbest strategy is to lead in innovation so the licensee will continue to depend on the licensor.\nLicensing arrangements vary. Companies such as Hyatt and Marriott sell management contracts  to \nowners of foreign hotels to manage these businesses for a fee. The management firm may have the \noption to purchase some share in the managed company within a stated period.\nIn contract manufacturing , the firm hires local manufacturers to produce the product. Volk -\nswagen has a contract agreement with Russian automotive conglomerate GAZ Group, whereby GAZ \nwill build the Volkswagen Jetta, \u0160koda Octavia, and \u0160koda Yeti models in Nizhny Novgorod for the \nRussian market. Toshiba, Hitachi, and other Japanese television manufacturers use contract manufac -\nturing to service the Eastern European market. Contract manufacturing reduces the company\u2019s control \nover the process and risks loss of potential profits. However, it offers a chance to start faster, with the \nopportunity to partner with or buy out the local manufacturer later.\nFinally, a company can enter a foreign market through franchising , a more comprehensive form \nof licensing. The franchisor offers a complete brand concept and operating system. In return, the fran -\nchisee pays certain fees to the franchisor. Quick-service operators such as McDonald\u2019s, Subway, and \nBurger King have franchised all over the world, as have service and retail companies like 7-Eleven, \nHertz, and Best Western Hotels.\nJOINT VENTURES\nJust doing business in another country may require the firm to license its product, form a joint \n venture  with a local firm, or buy from local suppliers to meet \u201cdomestic content\u201d requirements. \nMany firms have developed global strategic networks, with victory going to those who build the better \none. The Star Alliance brings together 28 airlines\u2014including Lufthansa, United Airlines, Singapore \nAirlines, SAS, and Avianca\u2014in a huge global partnership that enables travelers around the globe to \nmake nearly seamless connections to hundreds of destinations.\nHistorically, foreign investors have often joined local investors in a joint venture company in which \nthey share ownership and control. A joint venture may be necessary or desirable for economic or politi -\ncal reasons. The foreign firm might lack the financial, physical, or managerial resources to undertake \nthe venture alone, or the foreign government might require joint ownership as a condition for entry.\nThe value of a partnership can extend far beyond increased sales or access to distribution. Good \npartners share \u201cbrand values\u201d that help maintain brand consistency across markets. For example, the \nfierce commitment of McDonald\u2019s to product and service standardization is one reason why its retail \noutlets are so similar around the world.

If the host country \nrequires high severance pay for local employees, reducing or closing operations can be expensive.  \nA company might also be unable to successfully adapt its offering to the needs and preferences of local \ncustomers. Consider the challenges faced by Starbucks when it entered Australian markets.\nStarbucks  Despite its phenomenal success in the United States and many other countries \naround the globe, Starbucks did not flourish in Australia. The first Starbucks opened its doors \nin Australia in 2000, and the firm quickly grew to nearly 90 locations.

Another drawback is the potential \nmismatch between the corporate cultures of the two organizations\u2014a not unlikely scenario in global \nacquisitions. Acquisition also represents a longer-term commitment by the company to maintain a \npresence in the country in which the acquired company operates. Consequently, the decision to acquire \nanother firm involves careful consideration of its pros and cons of acquisition compared to other forms \nof global market entry.\nDeciding on the Global Marketing Program\nInternational companies must decide how extensively to adapt their marketing strategy to local \nconditions. At one extreme is a standardized marketing program  worldwide, which promises the \ngreatest consistency across individual countries. At the other extreme is an localized marketing \nprogram  in which the company, consistent with the marketing concept, believes consumer needs vary \nand tailors its marketing to each target group. Oreo cookies offers a good example of the latter strategy.\nOreo  In launching its Oreo brand of cookies worldwide, Kraft chose to adopt a consistent \nglobal positioning, \u201cMilk\u2019s Favorite Cookie.\u201d Although not necessarily highly relevant in all \ncountries, it did reinforce generally desirable associations like nurturing, caring, and health. \nTo help ensure global understanding, Kraft created a brand book in an Oreo-shaped box that \nsummarized brand management fundamentals\u2014what needed to be common across countries, \nwhat could be changed, and what could not. At first, Kraft tried to sell the U.S. Oreo everywhere. \nWhen research showed cultural differences in taste preferences\u2014Chinese found the cookies too \nsweet, whereas Indians found them too bitter\u2014new formulas were introduced across markets.

It ignores \ndifferences in areas such as the customer needs, wants, and usage patterns for products; customer \nresponse to marketing programs and activities; the different competitive environment; and the specif -\nics of the legal, cultural, and political context.\nGLOBAL PRODUCT STRATEGIES\nDeveloping global product strategies requires knowing what types of products or services are easily \nstandardized and what are appropriate adaptation strategies. There are three basic global product \nstrategies: straight extension, product adaptation, and product innovation.\nStraight Extension.  Straight extension introduces the product in the foreign market without \nany change. This strategy is tempting because it requires no additional research and development \nexpense, manufacturing retooling, or promotional modification. Straight extension has been success -\nful for cameras, consumer electronics, and many machine tools.\nMany high-end and luxury products also rely on product standardization because quality and \nprestige often can be marketed similarly across countries. Culture and wealth factors influence how \nquickly a new product takes off in a country, although adoption and diffusion rates are becoming more \nalike across countries over time. Food and beverage marketers find it more challenging to standardize, \nof course, given widely varying tastes and cultural habits.20\nStandardization can backfire if consumers differ in product knowledge, preferences, and usage \nbehavior. Campbell Soup Company lost an estimated $30 million introducing condensed soups in \nEngland; consumers saw expensive small cans and didn\u2019t realize water needed to be added. Here are \nsome other famous global marketing missteps:\nHallmark cards failed in France, where consumers dislike syrupy sentiment and prefer writing \ntheir own cards.\nPhilips became profitable in Japan only after reducing the size of its coffeemakers to fit smaller \nkitchens and its shavers to fit smaller hands.\nCoca-Cola withdrew its big two-liter bottle in Spain after discovering that few Spaniards owned \nrefrigerators that could accommodate it.\nTang, from General Foods, initially failed in France when it was positioned as a substitute for \norange juice at breakfast. The French drink little orange juice and almost never at breakfast.\nKellogg\u2019s Pop-Tarts failed in Britain because fewer homes have toasters than in the United States \nand the product was too sweet for British tastes.\nThe U.S. campaign for Procter & Gamble\u2019s Crest toothpaste initially failed in Mexico. Mexicans \ndid not care as much about the decay-prevention benefit or the scientifically oriented advertising \nappeal.\nGeneral Foods squandered millions trying to introduce packaged cake mixes to Japan, where only \n3 percent of homes at the time were equipped with ovens.\nS. C. Johnson\u2019s wax floor polish initially failed in Japan. It made floors too slippery for a culture in \nwhich people do not wear shoes at home.\nRather than fully customizing its products, a company may position its offerings differently across \nmarkets. In its medical-equipment business, Philips traditionally reserved high-end, premium products \nfor developed markets and emphasized products with basic functionality and affordability in develop -\ning markets. Increasingly, however, the company is designing, engineering, and manufacturing locally \nin emerging markets like China and India.\nWith a growing middle class in many emerging markets, many firms are assembling product \nportfolios to tap into different income segments. French food company Danone has many high-end \nhealthful products, such as Dannon yogurt, Evian water, and Bl\u00e9dina baby food, but it also sells prod -\nucts priced much lower targeting consumers with \u201cdollar-a-day\u201d food budgets.\nProduct Adaptation.  Differences in consumer behavior, as well as historical market factors, \nhave led marketers to position products differently in different markets. Because of all these differences, \nmost products require at least some adaptation.21 Even Coca-Cola is sweeter or less carbonated in cer -\ntain countries. Rather than assuming it can introduce its domestic product \u201cas is\u201d in another country, a \ncompany should review alterations to the following elements and determine which changes, if adopted, \nwould add more revenue than cost: product features, labeling, colors, ingredients, packaging, brand", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4524, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0e00ea0-b97e-4bf8-bfe1-ca947f11a1a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0e00ea0-b97e-4bf8-bfe1-ca947f11a1a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aff4e60d-29e6-46bc-899e-afea6b169594", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "7fedd54666f646ff178c2d4b40e3373c4be867a90b35fc02b8eac79fcc9af629", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85c8cab6-afac-404d-b57a-50134762f252", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "ccc0cafc26dfeaf3aba33edbb4a23738c2b82dbcaeb1253d578b8aed0a6218dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fcd4e041-2ef8-47a7-9539-228b6aa3fc5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36fce4517cbc0339bd08609c85bc88a9232cd0da59f534558f7f75d52ed4b713", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "454 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nname, sales promotion, prices, and advertising message, media, and creative execution. Consider the \nfollowing examples:\nHeineken beer is a high-end super-premium offering in the United States but a more middle-of-\nthe-road brew in its Dutch home market.\nHonda automobiles connote speed, youth, and energy in Japan but quality and reliability in the \nUnited States.\nThe Toyota Camry is the quintessential middle-class car in the United States but is at the high end \nin China, even though the cars in the two markets differ only cosmetically.\nProduct adaptation alters the product to meet local conditions or preferences. Depending on the \nsimilarity of customer preferences across different markets, product adaptation can occur on several \nlevels. A company can produce a regional version  of its product. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts has been introducing \nmore regionalized products, such as Coco Leche donuts in Miami and sausage kolaches in Dallas. \nA big hit in developing markets in Latin America, Mexico, and the Middle East, the powdered drink \nTang has added local flavors like lemon pepper, mango, and soursop. Alternatively, a company can \nproduce a country version  of its product. Kraft blends different coffees for the British (who drink coffee \nwith milk), the French (who drink it black), and Latin Americans (who want a chicory taste). In some \ncases, a company can produce a city version \u2014for instance, a beer to meet Munich\u2019s or Tokyo\u2019s tastes. A \ncompany can also produce different retailer versions , such as one coffee brew for the Migros chain store \nand another for the Cooperative chain store, both in Switzerland.\nSome companies have learned adaptation the hard way. The Euro Disney theme park, launched \noutside Paris in 1992, was harshly criticized as an example of U.S. cultural imperialism that ignored \nFrench customs and values, such as the serving of wine with meals. As one Euro Disney executive \nnoted, \u201cWhen we first launched, there was the belief that it was enough to be Disney. Now we realize \nour guests need to be welcomed on the basis of their own culture and travel habits.\u201d Renamed Disney -\nland Paris, the theme park eventually became one of Europe\u2019s biggest tourist attractions\u2014even more \npopular than the Eiffel Tower\u2014by incorporating a number of local touches.22\nProduct Invention.  Rather than using or adapting its current products, a company might choose \nto develop new products for its global markets. For example, to address the need of less developed \ncountries for low-cost, high-protein foods, companies such as Quaker Oats, Swift, and Monsanto have \nresearched these countries\u2019 nutrition requirements, formulated new foods, and developed advertising \nto gain product trial and acceptance.\nMcDonald\u2019s allows countries and regions to customize their basic layout and menu staples. \nMcDonald\u2019s aficionados can get fried shrimp in Switzerland, Sausage \u2018n Egg Twisty Pasta in Hong \nKong, Mozzarella Dippers\u2014a spin on mozzarella sticks\u2014in the UK, and the classic Georgie Pie in New \nZealand. McDonald\u2019s in Portugal offers a soup alternative to burgers, including bean and spinach soup. \nOther product innovations include Japan\u2019s chicken veggie burger, made from chicken, soybeans, and \nvegetables; the many vegetarian items available in India, from the McVeggie to the Veg Pizza McPuff, \nwhich features tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and an array of vegetables; Mexico\u2019s McMollette, an \nopen-faced breakfast sandwich with beans, cheese, and sauce; Germany\u2019s McToast pancakes, spread \nwith chocolate and folded up like a sandwich; and the McKroket in the Netherlands, a patty containing \nstew and beef topped with mustard sauce.

The use of artificial intelligence \nsoftware helps identify counterfeit storefronts and sales online by detecting advertisements similar to \nthose of legitimate brands and unauthorized internet sites that plaster brand trademarks and logos on \ntheir homepages. It also checks for keywords such as cheap, discount, authentic,  and factory variants,  as well \nas colors that products were never made in and prices that are far too low.\nGLOBAL BRAND STRATEGIES\nWhen entering global markets, a company must decide how to position its brand, as well as whether \nand how much to adapt the brand to the specifics of each particular market. It also must consider \nthe potential country-of-origin effects that are likely to influence the way the brand is perceived in \ndifferent markets around the world.\nBrand Adaptation.  When they launch products and services globally, marketers may need to \nchange certain brand elements. Even a brand name may require a choice between phonetic and seman -\ntic translations. When Clairol introduced the \u201cMist Stick,\u201d a curling iron, in Germany, it found that \nmist  is slang for manure . In China, Coca-Cola and Nike have both found sets of Chinese characters that \nsound broadly like their names but offer some relevant meaning at the same time (\u201cCan Be Tasty, Can \nBe Happy\u201d and \u201cEndurance Conquer,\u201d respectively).26\nNumbers and colors can take on special meaning in certain countries. The number four is con -\nsidered unlucky throughout much of Asia, because the Japanese and Chinese word for the number \nsounds like the word for \u201cdeath.\u201d Some East Asian buildings skip not only the fourth floor but often \nevery floor that has a four in it (14, 24, 40\u201349). Nokia doesn\u2019t release phone models containing the \nnumber four in Asia. Purple is associated with death in Burma and in some Latin American nations, \nwhite is a mourning color in India, and in Malaysia green connotes disease. Red generally signifies luck \nand prosperity in China.27\nBrand slogans or ad taglines sometimes need to be changed too: When Coors put its brand slogan \n\u201cTurn it loose\u201d into Spanish, some read it as \u201csuffer from diarrhea.\u201d A laundry soap ad claiming to wash \n\u201creally dirty parts\u201d was translated in French-speaking Qu\u00e9bec to read \u201ca soap for washing private parts.\u201d \nPerdue\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cIt takes a tough man to make a tender chicken\u201d\u2014was rendered into Spanish as  \n\u201cIt takes a sexually excited man to make a chicken affectionate.\u201d28\nCountry-of-Origin Effects.  Country-of-origin perceptions are the mental associations and \nbeliefs triggered by a country. Government officials want to strengthen their country\u2019s image to help \ndomestic marketers export and to attract foreign firms and investors. Marketers want to use positive \ncountry-of-origin perceptions to sell their products and services.\nGlobal marketers know that buyers hold distinct attitudes and beliefs about brands or products \nfrom different countries. These perceptions can stem from a variety of factors, including the attributes \nof the product, the meaning of the brand, and the country of origin (\u201cIf it\u2019s French, it must be stylish\u201d). \nCoca-Cola\u2019s success against local cola brand Jianlibao in China was partly due to its association with \nU.S. modernity and affluence. Consider the experience of Digicel:\nDigicel  launched in 2001, Jamaica-based Digicel has conquered politically unstable \ndeveloping countries such as Papua New Guinea, Haiti, and Tonga with mobile telecommunication \nproducts and services appealing to poor and typically overlooked consumers. The company \nstrives for 100 percent population coverage with its networks, bringing affordable mobile service \nto local and rural residents who have never before had the opportunity for coverage. It operates \nin 31 markets in the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia Pacific. To be locally relevant, Digicel \nsponsors local cricket, rugby, and other high-profile sports teams in each of these areas. Well-\nknown champion Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt is the chief Digicel Brand Ambassador for various \nadvertising and promotions across the region. The company also runs a host of community-based \ninitiatives in each market through the educational, cultural, and social development programs of \nits Digicel Foundation. The company\u2019s marketing efforts in Fiji are instructive. Pitched in a fierce \nbattle with incumbent Vodafone only two years after entry, Digicel Fiji even added a shade of light \nblue from the bottom of the Fiji national flag to its own red logo to reflect the company\u2019s pride in \nits contributions to Fijian life and sport, as reflected in its campaign \u201cFiji Matters to Us.\u201d29", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d244ae98-f256-4928-a1f8-3ec095d07556": {"__data__": {"id_": "d244ae98-f256-4928-a1f8-3ec095d07556", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6472607a-bc8c-405d-a149-2ed79ba8efd0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "613a90b7ec36877dcaef87ef831447e873b804bba8b2052ebc06152219144d9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3956380b-e322-4f0a-ab37-d38327af2370", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap20.pdf"}, "hash": "45f3627ec9f889738c2ca106bafe3d43ea59eb671f657226759fa20318ff1527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "975fa5d5-d7dd-43c4-99ff-d0d44099b374", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8d4d355492c8ce5c5978250553c68840c812d26c28920a85780ceca6004e7c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "456 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nThe mere fact that a brand is perceived as successful on a global stage\u2014whether it sends a quality \nsignal, taps into cultural myths, or reinforces a sense of social responsibility\u2014may lend credibility and \nrespect.30 Research studies have found that certain countries enjoy a reputation for certain goods: Japan \nfor automobiles and consumer electronics; the United States for high-tech innovations, soft drinks, \ntoys, cigarettes, and jeans; France for wine, perfume, and luxury goods.\nWhen consumers do not know where the products and brands come from, they often make infer -\nences about their origin.

To create this image, he came up with \nH\u00e4agen-Dazs\u2014a fabricated name that sounded cold, crisp, luxurious, and Danish. Yet the name \nis not Danish (in fact, the umlaut does not exist in that language), and the name is as meaningless \nin Danish as it is in English. But the arresting name, reinforced by the map of Scandinavia \nthat appeared on the cartons in which the product was sold, set the ice cream apart from its \ncompetitors and evoked an immediate association with shimmeringly clear, cold Scandinavian \nclimes. The added cachet of the quirky name contributed to building a reputation for H\u00e4agen-\nDazs as a richly textured luxury product that consumers perceived as being the best to be had.31\nMarketers must look at country-of-origin perceptions from both a domestic and a foreign per -\nspective. In the domestic market, these perceptions may stir consumers\u2019 patriotic notions or remind \nthem of their past. As international trade grows, consumers may view certain brands as symbolically \nimportant to their own cultural identity or as playing an important role in keeping jobs in their country. \nMore than three-quarters of U.S. consumers said that, given a choice between a product made at home \nand an identical one made abroad, they would choose the U.S. product.32\nMany brands have gone to great lengths to weave themselves into the cultural fabric of their for -\neign markets.

Haier is another global brand working \nhard to establish local roots in other countries.\nHaier  As China\u2019s leading maker of refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners, \nHaier was well known and respected in its home market for its well-designed products. For rural \ncustomers, Haier sold extra-durable washing machines that could wash vegetables as well as \nclothes; for urban customers, it made smaller washing machines to fit in tiny apartments. At the \nturn of the 21st century, the company set its sights on a much bigger goal: building a truly global \nbrand. Unlike most other Asian companies, which chose to enter Asian markets before considering \nWestern markets, Haier decided to target the United States and Western Europe first. The company \nfelt success there would make greater success possible elsewhere in the world. In the United \nStates, Haier established a beachhead by tapping a neglected market\u2014mini-fridges for homes, \noffices, dorms, and hotels\u2014and securing distribution at Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and other \ntop retailers. After some initial success, the company began to sell higher-end refrigerators and \nother appliances, such as air conditioners, washing machines, and dishwashers. Its goal is to \nbe seen as a \u201clocalized U.S. brand,\u201d not an \u201cimported Chinese brand.\u201d Thus, Haier invested in a \nmanufacturing plant in South Carolina and became a marketing partner with the National Basketball \nAssociation. By 2018, the company\u2019s revenue from overseas markets reached 40\u00a0percent of Haier\u2019s \ntotal revenue, and Haier is now the world\u2019s top-selling home appliance brand.33\nGLOBAL PRICING STRATEGIES\nThe same Gucci handbag may sell for $200 in Italy, $300 in the United States, and $400 in China. Why? \nGucci must add the cost of transportation, tariffs, importer margin, wholesaler margin, and retailer \nmargin to its factory price. Price escalation from these added costs and currency-fluctuation risk \nmight require the price to be two to five times as high for the manufacturer to earn the same profit. \nIn addition, prices reflect customers\u2019 willingness to pay for the benefits provided by the company\u2019s \noffering.\nCompanies have two basic choices for setting prices in different countries:\n\u2022 Set a uniform price everywhere.  PepsiCo might want to charge $1 for Pepsi everywhere in the world, \nbut then it would earn quite different profit rates in different countries. Also, this strategy would \nmake the price too high in poor countries and not high enough in rich countries.\n\u2022 Set a market-based price in each country.  PepsiCo could charge what each country could afford, but \nthis strategy ignores differences in the actual cost from country to country. It might also motivate \nintermediaries in low-price countries to reship their Pepsi to high-price countries.\nMarket-based pricing can lead to scenarios in which one unit charges another unit in the same \ncompany a transfer price for goods it ships to its foreign subsidiaries. If the company charges a sub -\nsidiary too high  a price, it may end up paying higher tariff duties, although it may pay lower income \ntaxes in the foreign country. If the company charges its subsidiary too low a price, it can be accused of \ndumping\u2014charging either less than its costs or less than it charges at home in order to enter or win a \nmarket. Various governments are watching for abuses and often force companies to set a price similar \nto prices charged by other competitors for the same product or a similar one.\nCountries with overcapacity, cheap currencies, and the need to export aggressively have pushed \ntheir prices down and devalued their currencies. Sluggish demand and reluctance to pay higher prices \nmake selling in these markets difficult. For example, when the Swedish home furnishings giant IKEA \nopened its first store in Beijing in 2002, local stores were selling copies of its designs at a fraction \nof IKEA\u2019s prices. The only way to compete in China\u2019s challenging pricing market was to drastically \nslash prices. By stocking its Chinese stores with Chinese-made products, IKEA has been able to slash \nprices as low as 70 percent below their level outside China. Although it still contends with persistent \nknockoffs, IKEA maintains sizable stores in 24 locations in China and continues opening new ones.34\nGLOBAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES\nCompanies vary in the extent to which they adapt their marketing communication for each local \nmarket.

GE\u2019s global \u201cEcomagination\u201d ad campaign substitutes \ncreative content in Asia and the Middle East to reflect cultural interests there. Even in the high-tech \nspace, local adaptations may be necessary.35 A company can also develop a global pool of ads from \nwhich each country selects the most appropriate\u2014an approach adopted by Coca-Cola and Good -\nyear. Finally, some companies allow their country managers themselves to create country-specific \nads\u2014within guidelines, of course.\nCompanies that adapt their communications wrestle with a number of challenges. They first must \nensure that their communications are legally and culturally acceptable. U.S. toy makers were surprised \nto learn that in many countries (Norway and Sweden, for example), no TV ads may be directed at \nchildren under 12. To foster a culture of gender neutrality, Sweden also prohibits sexist advertising\u2014a \ncommercial that spoke of \u201ccars for boys, princesses for girls\u201d was criticized by government advertising \nregulators.36\nA number of countries are taking steps to eliminate super skinny and airbrushed models in ads. \nIsrael has banned underweight models from print and TV ads and runway shows. Models must have a \nbody-mass index (BMI)\u2014a calculation based on height and weight\u2014of greater than 18.5. According \nto that BMI standard, a female model who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall can weigh no less than 119 pounds.37\nFirms next must check their creative strategies and communication approaches for appropriate -\nness. Comparative ads, though acceptable and even common in the United States and Canada, are less \nfrequent in the United Kingdom, unacceptable in Japan, and illegal in India and Brazil. The EU seems \nto have very low tolerance for comparative advertising and prohibits bashing rivals in ads.\nCompanies also must be prepared to vary the appeal of their messages. In advertising its hair care \nproducts, Helene Curtis observed that middle-class British women wash their hair frequently, Spanish \nwomen less so. Japanese women avoid over-washing for fear of removing protective oils. Effective \nmessaging in these countries must be cognizant of these differences. Language can vary, too\u2014the \nlocal language, another language such as English, or some combination. Personal selling tactics also \nmay need to change. The direct, no-nonsense approach favored in the United States (\u201cLet\u2019s get down \nto business\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d) may not work as well in Europe or Asia as an indirect, subtle \napproach.38\nGLOBAL DISTRIBUTION STRATEGIES\nWhen multinationals first enter a country, they prefer to work with local distributors who have good \nlocal knowledge, but friction often arises later.39 The multinational complains that the local distrib -\nutor doesn\u2019t invest in business growth, doesn\u2019t follow company policy, and doesn\u2019t share enough \ninformation. The local distributor complains of insufficient corporate support, impossible goals, \nand confusing policies. The multinational must choose the right distributors, invest in them, and set \nperformance goals to which both parties can agree.\nDistribution channels across countries vary considerably. To sell consumer products in Japan, \ncompanies must work through one of the most complicated distribution systems in the world. They \nsell to a general wholesaler, who sells to a product wholesaler, who sells to a product-specialty whole -\nsaler, who sells to a regional wholesaler, who sells to a local wholesaler, who finally sells to retailers. All \nthese distribution levels can double the consumer\u2019s price or triple the importer\u2019s price. Taking these \nsame consumer products to tropical Africa, the company might sell to an import wholesaler, who sells \nto several local wholesalers, who sell to petty traders working in local markets.\nAnother difference is the size and character of retail units abroad. Large-scale retail chains domi -\nnate the U.S. scene, but much foreign retailing is in the hands of small, independent retailers. Millions \nof Indian retailers operate tiny shops or sell in open markets. Markups are high, but the real price comes \ndown through haggling.

They harm distributor relationships, tarnish the \nmanufacturer\u2019s brand equity, and undermine the integrity of the distribution channel. They can even \npose risks to consumers if the product is damaged, relabeled, obsolete, without warranty or support, \nor just counterfeit.

Its opposite, femininity, reflects \na preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the \nweak, and quality of life.\n\u2022 Uncertainty Avoidance Index.  Uncertainty avoid-\nance reflects the degree to which the members of \na society feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and \nambiguity.

It also must consider the country-\nof-origin effects that are likely to influence the way the \nbrand is perceived in the particular market.\n7.

The level \nof adaptation can vary from minor variations in the \nmarketing program to entirely different pricing and \ncommunication policies for each target country.\n8.

Going abroad involves two major types of risks: general \nrisks associated with entering a new market and specific \nrisks associated with doing business in a different \ncountry. When deciding to go abroad, a company must \ncarefully assess the risk\u2013reward ratio for each global \nmarket it considers entering.\n2. Deciding whether to go abroad is the first of several \ndecisions a company must make when developing \nits global strategy. If the company has concluded that \ngoing abroad is indeed the best course of action, it must \nthen make a set of more specific decisions, including \nwhich markets to enter, how best to enter these markets, \nthe specific marketing program for each market, and \nthe most effective way to structure the marketing \norganization in each country.\n3. Once a company decides to target a particular country, \nit must choose the best mode of entry with its brands. Its \nbroad choices are indirect exporting, direct exporting, \nlicensing, joint ventures, and direct investment, ordered \nin terms of ascending commitment, risk, control, and \nprofit potential.\n4.

The name IKEA is an acronym for Ingvar Kamprad\u2019s \nname; Elmtaryd, the farm where he grew up; and Agunnaryd,  \nhis hometown in Sweden. Kamprad started the business by \nselling pens, wallets, and watches door to door. Eventually, \nhe added furniture to his portfolio, which was mostly sold \nthrough mail orders. IKEA found initial success in selling \nfurniture because of its low prices. In 1953, IKEA opened its \nfirst mobile showroom in Almhult, Sweden. The showroom \ndemonstrated the quality and functionality of its low-cost \nfurniture. The popularity of IKEA\u2019s first showroom inspired \nthe company to open its first retail location 5 years later  \nin the same city. The profitability of IKEA\u2019s Almhult \nshowroom spurred the spread of IKEA across Europe, \nstarting with Norway in 1963. Enjoying success in European \ncountries, the company expanded across the world, \nreaching the United States, Asia, and Australia by the early \n21st century.\nIKEA\u2019s business model is based on mass production of \nthe same types of products, which allows it to benefit from \nlarge economies of scale. By securing low costs from suppli-\ners, IKEA is able to charge low prices to consumers. Products \nare designed to be sleek, functional, and minimalistic so that \nthey will appeal to the greatest number of budget-minded \nshoppers. In addition, IKEA keeps its prices low by assign-\ning customers the responsibility of furniture assembly. IKEA \nfurniture is packed neatly and tightly into cardboard boxes. \nIKEA attempts to remove as much air as possible from this \n\u201cflat packing\u201d to allow furniture to fit inside shipping contain-\ners without wasting any space, thus reducing the costs of \nshipping.\nDespite its success in Europe, IKEA has faced prob-\nlems replicating the business model globally. To solve these \nissues, IKEA identified strategic challenges in each market \nand has adjusted accordingly to overcome them. For exam-\nple, one of IKEA\u2019s main value propositions in Europe and \nNorth America is its low-cost furniture. In China, however, \nIKEA\u2019s furniture is priced slightly higher than the average. \nIKEA realized that the same value proposition did not hold, \nso it began targeting young middle-class customers, who \nwere on average wealthier, better educated, and more aware \nof Western style. IKEA also began locally sourcing materi-\nals and manufacturing. This enabled it to stay competitive in \nprice. IKEA also emphasized its position as a good-quality, \nWestern-style brand.\nIKEA employs extensive market research to improve \nits sales in different markets by tailoring aspects such as product design and offering services. For example, IKEA\u2019s \nresearch has shown that the world\u2019s population is mov-\ning into apartments and homes with smaller living spaces. \nAccordingly, IKEA has designed products such as lamps and \ntables that have built-in wireless charging to save space from \nwire clutter. When research showed that the DIY packaging \nof IKEA products met with negative reception in China, IKEA \nbegan offering delivery and assembly fees. IKEA also opened \nstores in popular areas near transportation lines (as opposed \nto suburbs) in Asian cities, because many lack access to \ncars. IKEA showrooms provide model bedrooms, dining \nrooms, and family rooms and suggest how to furnish them, \nan important consideration given that home ownership in \nChina has gone from practically zero 25 years ago to over  \n70 percent today. Young couples are especially drawn to \nIKEA\u2019s stylish, functional modern styles.\nBy understanding each country\u2019s different consumers \nand cultural nuances, IKEA is also able to create one-size-\nfits-all solutions instead of tweaking its products for different \nmarkets. Many customers spend time in IKEA\u2019s full-size \nsample rooms.
