Dyson, became frus -\ntrated with how soon his vacuum cleaner lost suction. He quickly found the problem, which was that \nthe vacuum cleaner\u2019s bag rapidly became blocked with dust, constricting the airflow and reducing \nthe suction. Dyson realized that this was not just a problem with his vacuum cleaner but was also \na flaw in the way all vacuum cleaners were designed. Determined to solve the problem and design \na machine that \u201cnever loses suction\u201d (which later became the advertising tagline for his vacuum \ncleaners), Dyson designed a vacuum cleaner that, instead of using a bag, relied on centrifugal force The development of new offerings shapes the company\u2019s future. Without investing in develop -\ning new offerings, a company is destined to rely on acquiring new products developed by other \ncompanies to ensure sustained growth. The development of new offerings is the engine that drives \na company\u2019s success, enabling it to challenge industry norms and apply imaginative solutions that \nengage and delight customers.

Such innovation does \nnot come quickly or cheaply. It took more than four years, some 600 prototypes, research on more \nthan 1,000 miles of human hair, and $71 million to develop the dryer.1\nThis chapter provides an overview of the process of developing new market offerings. Because the \nterm new products  is commonly used in reference to new market offerings, we use these terms are used \ninterchangeably. Thus, the following discussion is relevant not only to new products and services but \nalso to the development of the business models of an enterprise.\nThe Process of Developing New Market \nOfferings\nInnovation is the key to developing viable new offerings. Innovation is not limited to the development \nof new products or services. It can involve a new technology, a new approach to brand building, a \nnew pricing mechanism, a new way of managing incentives, new channels of communication, or a \nnovel distribution method. Innovation is particularly important in industries that are characterized by \nhigh technological uncertainty, high market uncertainty, fierce competition, high investment costs, \nand short product life cycles. Innovative offerings disrupt existing business models and make com -\npanies\u00a0that fail to adapt to changing market conditions superfluous by devising new ways to create \nmarket value.\nTHE INNOVATION IMPERATIVE\nIn an economy characterized by rapid change, continuous innovation is a necessity. Companies that \nfail to develop new products leave themselves vulnerable to changing customer needs and tastes, \nshortened product life cycles, increased domestic and foreign competition, and lack of awareness of \nthe potential market opportunities opened up by new technologies.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2978, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "602ea4bb-06b0-45b5-895c-445032b6ed74": {"__data__": {"id_": "602ea4bb-06b0-45b5-895c-445032b6ed74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2fa947b-2b47-418c-b849-b77ac26b3e71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "66cb12b0748b731018f0a07ef54fe4d93e1494d7e98795c936e71b1189ca5964", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "509eee06-409c-4826-8a10-85f48053eeab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "b5186203ddcd1f5edfac71c9eec6a1ac2b028958194316abed0552df8c2c9e96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "268da6b0-2ff7-4e67-a272-6ea0b0dd0027", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e64dc0436b9c7fa9aa4711be218e0a4d4f042ce44027f77512f0802f23313dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "398 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nHighly innovative firms are able to repeatedly identify and quickly seize new market opportunities. \nThey create a positive attitude toward innovation and risk taking, \u201croutinize\u201d the innovation process, \npractice teamwork, and allow their people to experiment and even fail. One such firm is W. L. Gore.\nW. L. Gore  Best known for its GORE-TEX high-performance fabrics, W. L. Gore has \nintroduced breakthrough versions of guitar strings, dental floss, medical devices, and fuel \ncells\u2014while constantly reinventing the uses of the polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). \nSeveral principles guide the company\u2019s new-product development. First, it works with potential \ncustomers. Its thoracic graft, designed to combat heart disease, was developed in close \ncollaboration with physicians. Second, Gore has a distinctly egalitarian culture; it lets employees \nchoose projects and appoints few product leaders and teams. The company likes to nurture \n\u201cpassionate champions\u201d who convince others that a project is worth their time and commitment, \nand leaders have positions of authority because they have followers. Third, all research associates \nspend 10 percent of their work hours on \u201cdabble time,\u201d developing their own ideas. Promising \nideas are judged according to a \u201cReal, Win, Worth\u201d exercise: Is the opportunity real? Can we win? \nCan we make money? Fourth, Gore knows when to let go, although dead ends in one area can \nspark innovation in another: Elixir acoustic guitar strings were the result of a failed venture into \nbike cables. Even successful ventures may need to move on. Glide shred-resistant dental floss \nwas sold to Procter & Gamble because Gore knew retailers want to deal with a company selling \na family of health care products. W. L. Gore employs nearly 10,000 people in dozens of countries \naround the globe and has revenue of more than $3.5 billion.2\nInnovation ranges from minor improve -\nments or revisions of existing products to \nnew-to-the-world items that create an entirely \nnew market. Fewer than 10 percent of all new \nproducts can be considered truly innovative \nand new to the world. Most new-product \nactivity is concentrated on improving exist -\ning products. This form of continuous inno -\nvation can broaden a brand\u2019s meaning and \nforce competitors to play catch-up. Many \nof the supermarket product launches in the \npast decade have been brand extensions, \nsuch as Tide Pods, Gillette Fusion ProShield, \nDowny Unstopables, Colgate Total Clean-  \nIn-Between, and Oreo Thins. At Sony, modifi -\ncations of established products have accounted \nfor over 80 percent of new-product activity. \nIn fact, most established companies focus on \n incremental innovation , entering new mar -\nkets by tweaking products for new customers, \nusing variations on a core product to stay one \nstep ahead of the market, and creating interim \nsolutions for industry-wide problems.\nThe focus on minor variations of existing \nproducts is due in part to the fact that it is \nincreasingly difficult to identify blockbuster \nproducts that will transform a market. \nNonetheless, many companies continue to \npursue new-to-the-world innovations. These \ninnovations are typically associated with \ngreat risk and cost, but if they succeed, they \ncan improve the corporate image, create a \ngreater sustainable competitive advantage \nfor the company, and produce significant \nfinancial rewards.3>> Product development at W. L. Gore entails working closely with customers, \n letting employees choose their projects, giving leadership positions to passionately \ncommitted employees, allowing researchers space to develop their own ideas, and \nknowing when to call a halt to a venture. \nYOU STAY DRY, \nPROTECTED AND \nFOCU SED OUTSIDE\ngore-tex .comExper ience moreWITH GORE-TEX\u00ae\nPRO SHELL INSIDE.\nThe question isn\u2019t if you\u2019re going to climb in \nunpredictable we ather, it\u2019s how.

For the speed, convenience, and variety offered, users are willing to pay 10 times the \ncost of a traditionally brewed cup of coffee. This has helped Keurig sales to exceed $11 billion and its \nrevenue-based market share of the single-cup coffee market to reach 30 percent.4\nSuccessful new-product launches are exceptions rather than the rule. New products fail at rates \nestimated to be as high as 95 percent. The most common reasons include ignored or misinterpreted \nmarket research, overestimates of market size, high development costs, poor product performance, \ninadequate pricing, ineffective communication, insufficient distribution support, proactive com -\npetitive response, lack of organizational support for the new offering, and inadequate return on the \ncompany\u2019s investment. The different reasons for failure can be summed up in one sentence: The new \noffering fails to create superior value for its target customers in a way that sufficiently benefits the \ncompany and its collaborators.\nMANAGING INNOVATION\nInnovation does not happen in a vacuum. Innovative products are created by individuals, many of \nwhom work for both small and large enterprises. Therefore, creating an environment that fosters \ninnovation and encourages the development of new products is paramount.5 Companies handle the \norganizational aspect of innovation in different ways. Some of the popular approaches to managing \ninnovation are outlined as follows:\n\u2022 Departments in charge of current offerings.  A common approach to foster and manage \ninnovation is to assign responsibility for developing new products and services to managers in \ncharge of a given product category, brand, or market. The advantage of this approach is that these \nmanagers have a solid understanding of customer needs, the competitive environment, and the \nprocesses involved in designing, communicating, and delivering the company\u2019s products to its \ncurrent customers. On the downside, managers in charge of offerings that already exist are often \nfocused on these offerings and may lack the skills, knowledge, and motivation to develop suc -\ncessful new products.\n\u2022 New-product departments.  Large companies often establish a new-product department headed \nby a manager with substantial authority and access to top management, along with responsibility \nfor generating and screening new ideas, working with the research and development department, \nand carrying out field testing and commercialization. Eli Lilly put every  department engaged in \nthe process of turning molecules into medicine\u2014from the research and development staff to the \nteam that seeks FDA approval\u2014under one roof to improve efficiency and cut development time.\n\u2022 Innovation centers.  Some firms open innovation centers in new geographic locations to better \ndesign new products for those regions. For example, Microsoft has over 100 innovation centers \nworldwide forging partnerships with local government, universities, and industry collaborators. \nIn the same vein, the networking giant Cisco has built a network of innovation centers located \naround the world, each serving as a hub to build solutions with partners and start-ups, to engage in \nrapid prototyping, as well as to invest in and partner with start-ups, accelerators, and universities.\n\u2022 Venture teams.  Another approach to driving innovation involves assigning new-product \ndevelopment to venture teams\u2014cross-functional groups charged with developing a specific \nproduct or business. These intrapreneurs  are relieved of other duties and given a separate budget \nand a longer time frame than is typical. They are also often organized in a \u201cskunkworks\u201d setting\u2014\ninformal workplaces, sometimes garages, where entrepreneurial-minded teams work to develop \nnew products. For example, as it transformed itself from a PC company into a solutions company \nin the cyber-security and data center design and management business, Dell established separate \nheadquarters for its new units, with marching orders to think entrepreneurially.6\n\u2022 Communities of practice.  Another organizational arrangement for new-product development \ninvolves creating forums in which employees from different departments are encouraged to share \ntheir knowledge and skills. For example, Japanese pharmaceutical maker Esai Co. has formed more \nthan 400 innovation communities. One of these innovation centers helped develop an easy-to-\nswallow, jelly-like medication for Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Grocery retailer Supervalu commissioned \n29 innovation community-of-practice projects, 22 of which ended up being implemented by the \ncompany.7\n\u2022 Cross-functional teams.  Creating project-specific teams combining different skillsets is another \npopular approach to fostering innovation.

Cross-functional \nteams composed of both engineers and marketers help ensure that a company\u2019s research and \ndevelopment efforts are not driven to create a \u201cbetter mousetrap\u201d when potential customers do \nnot need or want one.\nTHE STAGE-GATE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING NEW \nOFFERINGS\nNew-product development is commonly represented as a sequence of actions (stages) separated by \nhurdles (gates) that the new offering must overcome.8 The stage-gate approach divides the innovation \nprocess into stages, with a gate or checkpoint at the end of each stage. The ultimate goal of using a \nstage-gate approach to new-product development is to ensure market success in a way that minimizes \nrisk and optimizes allocation of the company\u2019s resources.\nStage-gate systems have evolved over the years as users have made them more flexible, adap -\ntive, and scalable, with improved built-in governance, integrated portfolio management, incorporated \naccountability and continuous improvement, and ongoing input from a wide range of sources both \ninside and outside the company. By using a stepwise approach of formulating, testing, realigning, and \npivoting, a company aims to separate the wheat from the chaff, weeding out bad ideas and investing \nin the ones that are most likely to produce the desired outcome. For example, at Tata Steel, about 50 to \n100 ideas are generated for every one that makes it to implementation, and at any point in time, 50 to \n70 product-development projects are in the pipeline before some clear the final-phase gate.9\nThere is no single stage-gate format; companies vary in the ways they define different stages of \nproduct development and the hurdles that the new offering must overcome. At the same time, there \nare several similarities between these approaches that can be distilled into an overarching stage-gate \nframework  for managing the process of developing new offerings. This framework presents a stream -\nlined version of the stage-gate approach, which comprises five key stages\u2014 idea generation , concept devel -\nopment , business-model design , offering development , and commercial deployment  \u2014separated by hurdles that \naim to validate the actions taken in the previous step. This stage-gate framework for developing new \nofferings is depicted in Figure 18.1.\nThe five stages of the stage-gate approach to developing new offerings can be summarized as \nfollows:\n\u2022 Idea generation.  The starting point for developing a new offering is uncovering an unmet cus -\ntomer need and coming up with an idea about how to fulfill this need better than the available \nalternatives. The initial idea outlines in broad strokes the ways in which the company can address \nthe focal customer need, without going into much detail about the specifics of the market offer -\ning. Idea generation is followed by an assessment of the soundness of the idea and validation of \nits key assumptions.\n\u2022 Concept development.  Following validation of the idea, the next step is the development of an \ninitial version (prototype) of the offering that has the core functionality of the proposed offering. \nThe developed concepts are then validated by assessing their technological feasibility and poten -\ntial to fulfill the uncovered customer need.\n\u2022 Business-model design.  The validated concept then becomes the core of a business model that \ndefines the offering\u2019s target market, the value created by the offering in this market, and the key \nattributes of the offering. The business model is validated on the basis of the degree to which it \nis able to fulfill the identified customer need in a way that sufficiently benefits the company and \nits collaborators.\n\u2022 Offering implementation.  The validated business model is still only a plan; the company has \nnot developed a market-ready version of the offering. To fulfill the needs of its target customers \nFIGURE 18.1 \nThe Stage-Gate \nFramework  \nfor Developing  \nNew Offerings\nIdea\ngenerationConcept\ndevelopment\nIdea\nvalidationBusiness model\ndesignOffering\ndevelopmentCommercial\ndevelopment\nConcept\nvalidationBusiness model\nvalidationOffering\nvalidation", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4321, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad1e8b59-1293-4fc6-954c-9294aaaecb4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad1e8b59-1293-4fc6-954c-9294aaaecb4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05b4a737-9563-4f20-960a-5137998e56c0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "cccbffd065eae267fc627eb56f05a2aed8dafede3b81c9967923f1e7df67f7cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66a6a698-56f1-482c-a567-155d245bf68d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "a21aa9af091328cbf0def7d8818745a4b0e35b638924efbf6e557f8901f229d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d458979a-d439-46bc-8e2a-00c67dbfbb88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3749d13f2d910d3d3ca113f7f600190901f9c5449385e110f1b2e1b8e0e8ed3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 18    |  DEvELOPING  NEW MARkET OFFERINGS  401\nand create value for its stakeholders and collaborators, the company must develop the resources \nneeded to create the offering and then develop a market-ready version of it.\n\u2022 Commercial deployment.  The market-ready version of the offering is then commercially \ndeployed, meaning that it is communicated and made available to target customers. Commer -\ncial deployment often begins with launching the offering in selected markets before making the \noffering available to the entire target market. The commercial deployment is concomitant with \ncontinuous market testing and optimizing of the product to better meet the needs of the target \ncustomers, respond to changes in the market environment, and take advantage of any changes in \nthe underlying technology, know-how, and business processes.\nThe stage-gate approach encompasses three aims. Its goal is to develop: (1) a desirable  offering that \ntarget customers will find attractive, (2) a technologically feasible  offering that the company will find \ndoable, and (3) a viable  offering that will create value for the company and its collaborators. Desirability, \nfeasibility, and viability are integral to the process of developing an offering, although these factors \nplay different roles. The offering\u2019s desirability is typically paramount in the idea-generation phase of \nproduct development. Both desirability and feasibility share the focus during concept development. \nAnd business-model design aims to ensure that all three of these criteria are met before implementing \nthe final version of the offering and bringing it to market.\nThe high uncertainty and risk associated with new-product development implies that for every \nsuccessful innovation there are many innovative ventures that did not pan out. The high rate of failure \nof new-product development projects suggests that in order to end up with a viable market offering, \na company must start with a number of new ideas that, through a series of screening, pivoting, and \nrealignments will produce a successful outcome. In this context, having hurdles (gates) is important \nfor managing resource allocation, investing in projects that have a high probability of succeeding, and \nscreening out projects that cannot be validated at the different stages of the new-product development \nprocess.\nThus, at the beginning of the process, the company might consider a large number of ideas at a \nrelatively low cost. Many of these ideas are screened out; only a few proceed to the concept-development \nstage, which requires a relatively larger investment in prototyping and testing. As the projects go \nthrough the different stages of the development process, the number of viable alternatives is reduced \nto a few options (or often a single option) to be commercialized. At the same time, the investment \nper project increases, with the last two stages\u2014commercialization and commercial deployment\u2014\ntypically requiring the most of the company\u2019s resources.\nThe stage-gate approach outlined previously represents a streamlined version of the process of \ndeveloping a new offering. On many occasions, the development of a new offering might not follow a \npredefined series of orderly, well-delineated steps but might instead entail actions that do not follow \nthe linear format of the stage-gate framework. I is not uncommon for a new-offering development \nproject to pass the idea-generation stage only to fail to overcome some of the subsequent hurdles. \nIn such cases, the company must go back to the drawing board and perhaps even reevaluate the idea \nand/or the concept underlying the entire project. Note, however, that even though the new-product \ndevelopment process might involve multiple iterations rather than a linear process in which each stage \nnaturally transitions into the next, the stage-gate framework outlined previously offers a set of action -\nable guidelines that can streamline the process of developing new offerings.\nTHE STAGE-GATE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING NEW \nOFFERINGS: AN ILLUSTRATION\nThe stage-gate approach to business-model development can be illustrated with the following exam -\nple. Consider a food-processing company seeking to introduce a new product that will increase its \nmarket presence and fuel its revenue growth. The five stages of developing a new offering can be \ndelineated as shown here.\nIdea Generation and Validation.

Note that these ideas affect not only the way the product would be formulated but also the \nmarket in which it would compete. An instant-breakfast drink would compete against bacon and eggs, \nbreakfast cereals, coffee and pastry, and other breakfast alternatives. A snack drink would compete \nagainst soft drinks, fruit juices, sports drinks, and other thirst quenchers.\nAfter evaluating the pros and cons of different options, the company decides to go ahead with \nthe first idea and develop an instant-breakfast drink. Next, the product idea must be fleshed out and \nturned into a specific product concept.\nConcept Development and Validation.  To turn the idea into a product concept, the \n company has to articulate the specific attributes of its market offering: What will be the particular \nproduct  formulation? What ingredients will it involve and how will they be mixed? What brand  name \nand associations will identify this product? What are the price  points at which this offering will be sold? \nWhat incentives  will be associated with this product? How will the company communicate  this offering to \nits target customers? How will this product be delivered  to its target customers?\nTo address these questions, the company may conduct market research to examine how its \nproduct will stand in relationship to other breakfast options.

The \ncompany might also examine the extant market offerings\u2014its own breakfast products as well as \nproducts offered by its competitors. Finally, the company might consider the likely size of the market \nfor its product: Are there many customers whose needs the company\u2019s offering can address better \nthan the competition?\nBased on its evaluation of the customer market, the competitive offerings, and its own goals and \nresources, the company might decide to develop a mid-price product emphasizing nutrition and con -\nvenience. At this stage, the product concept is defined as \u201ca powdered mixture added to milk to make \na tasty instant breakfast that provides all daily nutrition needs in three flavors (chocolate, vanilla, and \nstrawberry) and individual packets, six to a box, at $2.99 a box.\u201d The product concept can be thought \nof as the value proposition the company will offer to its target customers.\nBusiness-Model Design and Validation.  Following the development and validation of the \nproduct concept, the company must make the case for why customers will buy the company\u2019s offering \nand how the company and its collaborators will benefit from launching the offering. To this end, the \ncompany must articulate (1) the specifics of the target market (size of the market, core competitors, \nand key collaborators), (2) the value the offering creates for target customers, the company, and its \ncollaborators, and (3) the key attributes of the offering (product, brand, price, incentives, communica -\ntion, and distribution).\nThe target market  for the product consists of adults who are short on time and seek a convenient, \nnutritious, and moderately priced breakfast meal. The customer demand estimates show that this is \na sufficiently large market to enable the company to reach its revenue and profit goals. The competi -\ntive analysis further shows that even though there are several large competitors in this space, most \nof them compete at either the high end or the low end of the market, so there is an opportunity for a \nmid-range-priced breakfast offering.\nThe value  that the company\u2019s offering creates in this market can be defined along three key \n dimensions\u2014customer value, collaborator value, and company value.\n\u2022 For target customers \u2014strapped-for-time middle-class families with children\u2014the offering will \n create value by providing a convenient, nutritious, and moderately priced breakfast meal.\n\u2022 For collaborators \u2014suppliers and distributors\u2014the offering will create value by generating \n additional sales at competitive rates.\n\u2022 For the company stakeholders , the offering will create value by providing a new stream of revenue and \nprofit. It will also allow the company to gain market position and build a strong brand that can be \nused as a platform for additional offerings. Specifically, the company plans initially to sell 500,000 \ncases for a 2.5 percent share of the market, with a loss in the first year not exceeding $1.3\u00a0million. \nOver the course of five years, the company intends to gain a 12 percent market share and realize \nan after-tax return on investment of 12 percent.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4954, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b755b9f7-49a3-454d-a983-ae6850c9c36d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b755b9f7-49a3-454d-a983-ae6850c9c36d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a83befcb-999d-4b70-9407-56895c2b44c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "970274206ebdfaa9d0ae9b526dc4b5afd2227f03607fcda3a2b9b8eb15799a33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d458979a-d439-46bc-8e2a-00c67dbfbb88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "4f744525f7db2a8acfb7d428fa8b97d2b71dfc70c838e90eab7d868edce73335", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c68794fb-16dc-47c0-9391-a044f6ce1d3a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0aeb13a2938d363382405b875758916d63a2003f0e1a7cb65afe9817a683544", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 18    |  DEvELOPING  NEW MARkET OFFERINGS  403\nFollowing definition of the target market and the offering\u2019s value proposition, the company  \nmust build on the initial concept of the market offering  and define the attributes of the new  \noffering in greater detail. In this context, the key attributes of the company offering might be defined \nas follows:\nThe product will be offered in chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors, in individual \n packets of six to a box, at a retail price of $2.99 a box. There will be 48 boxes per case, and \nthe case\u00a0price to distributors will be $78. To ensure trade support, retailers will be offered \none case free for every four cases bought during the first two months, plus allowances for \n cooperative advertising. Free samples will be distributed in stores. Coupons for 50 cents off \nwill appear in newspapers and online. The total sales promotional budget will be $15\u00a0  million. \nOne-third of an advertising budget of $6 million will go into television and two-thirds into \nonline, equally split between outbound and inbound communication. Advertising copy \nwill emphasize the benefit concepts of nutrition and convenience. During the first year, \n$100,000\u00a0will be spent on marketing research to buy store audits and consumer-panel infor -\nmation to monitor  market reaction.\nOffering Implementation and Market Testing.  Following the design of a viable busi -\nness model, the company embarks on developing the offering\u2014that is, creating the actual prod -\nuct that will be made available in the market. To this end, the company must first ensure that it \nhas the resources  needed to make the product concept a reality. For example, the company might \nhave to procure the manufacturing facilities and ensure the availability of the ingredients needed to \n produce the breakfast meal created by the food engineers in the company\u2019s research and develop -\nment department.\nOnce the necessary resources have been secured, the company can proceed with implementing the \noffering \u2014turning its new-product concept of a breakfast meal into a market-ready product. To this end, \nthe company must produce the actual breakfast meal, design its packaging, create its brand identity, \nset retail and wholesale prices, define sales promotions for retailers and consumers, secure the com -\nmunication channels that will inform target customers about the company\u2019s product, and assemble \nthe distribution channels that will deliver this product to target customers.\nFollowing the development of the offering, the company conducts a market test  to validate its \noffering. Specifically, the company chooses Columbus, Ohio\u2014a popular location for testing new fast-\nfood products because it is reasonably representative demographically of the rest of the nation and is \na contained market with reasonable media rates. Based on the results of the market test, the company \nmodifies its offering by tweaking the product formula, streamlining product packaging, and updating \nits brand identity.\nCommercial Deployment.  Following the development of the offering, the company is ready \nfor commercial deployment. To minimize risk and the initial outlay of resources involved in launch -\ning the product, and to ensure its ability to further modify the product based on market response, the \ncompany chooses to deploy its product in selected markets . To ensure early success of the offering and \ngenerate a stream of revenue, the company chooses to focus on a subset of its target customers who \nare most likely to adopt its offering and whom the company can reach to communicate and deliver its \nproduct in an effective and cost-efficient manner. In addition, rather than launching all three flavors \nof its breakfast meal, the company decides to launch its most popular flavor\u2014chocolate\u2014first and \nintroduce the other flavors at a later point.\nOnce the product has been successfully launched in the primary market, has been well received \nby consumers, and has created a stream of revenue to partially offset the costs of developing the new \noffering, the company expands  the initial market to include all customers who might benefit from the \nnew breakfast meal. The company then scales up production, begins promoting its product beyond \nthe primary market, and ensures that the offering is available across the entire target market. As its \ntarget market broadens, the company also broadens the available product assortment and launches the \nother breakfast meal flavors. In addition, it considers launching volume packs to deliver greater value \nto customers who have adopted its offering and consume it on a regular basis.\nThe key aspects of the five components of the stage-gate model\u2014 idea generation, concept development, \nbusiness-model design, offering implementation,  and commercial deployment \u2014are discussed in more detail in \nthe following sections.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4896, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c68794fb-16dc-47c0-9391-a044f6ce1d3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c68794fb-16dc-47c0-9391-a044f6ce1d3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "705b014e-aefe-4eb7-a7c8-d5825225f0f6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "95ef257f55305838c03d6dc9be25671d2363ea7e5601ac212639a172ff68bb62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b755b9f7-49a3-454d-a983-ae6850c9c36d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "dc5ac6ee503d0ff36e173b093a9bffeba07fbb68a7995d0b39c3896fa629e7fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94298395-3dc4-44be-9e4e-e9959b299f98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afc985c60631773e7730d8d3a3bdf0f4c961786515652e64f9065c567b6269a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "404 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nIdea Generation\nThe search for viable ideas is the starting point of new-product development. Some of the greatest \nopportunities and highest leverage for new products can be found by uncovering unmet customer \nneeds that the company can fulfill better than the completion.\nGENERATING VIABLE IDEAS\nSuccessful innovations result from identifying a novel approach to address an unmet market need. \nInnovation marries a customer need with a creative idea that addresses this need. Depending on the \nimpetus of the innovation, there are two approaches to idea generation: market-driven, or top-down, \nand invention-driven, or bottom-up.\nTop-down idea generation  begins with identifying a market opportunity followed by devel -\noping an offering specifically designed to address this opportunity. The market opportunity must \naddress an important problem faced by potential customers that it can solve better than the avail -\nable alternatives can. Thus, top-down idea generation starts with a market analysis that aims to \nidentify an important unmet need that the company can fulfill in a way that is superior to its \ncompetitors.\nA number of successful products have resulted from top-down idea generation. Motiv realized \nthat many consumers found fitness tracker bracelets and other wearable devices too bulky and uncom -\nfortable, to say nothing of lacking in style. So it bundled a step counter, heart-rate monitor, and sleep \ntracker in a discreet and stylish ring that not only looks good but is water resistant and withstands the \nelements. Varidesk products allow users to both sit and stand while doing computer and other office \ntasks. The products were a direct result of widely publicized concerns about the effects of constant \nsitting on long-term health. Learning thermostats from Nest filled the need for temperature control \nthat didn\u2019t require constant programming, yet saved energy and money and kept the home atmosphere \ncomfortable. The Nest smart home-security devices that followed targeted consumers who didn\u2019t want \nthe hassle and ongoing expense of having an outside home-monitoring system installed, yet wanted \nto implement security measures.\nBottom-up idea generation  is the opposite of top-down generation: It starts with an invention \nand then seeks to identify an unmet market need. With bottom-up idea generation, the invention is \ndriven by technological innovation rather than by an identified market need. Because it is rooted \nin technology, the bottom-up approach is more likely to be employed by research scientists than \nby marketing managers. And the market applications of technology innovation often come about \naccidentally.\nAmong the technologically innovative products that have resulted from bottom-up idea genera -\ntion are Evista , which failed as a contraceptive but was turned into a multibillion-dollar drug to treat \nosteoporosis. Strattera  started out as an unsuccessful antidepressant before it became a top-selling atten -\ntion deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug. The iconic toy Slinky  was the accidental outcome of \na naval engineer\u2019s attempt to design a meter to monitor power on battleships, after tension springs fell \nto the floor and kept bouncing. An electrical engineer\u2019s research on the use of radio frequency to offset \nhypothermia occasioned the discovery that a cooled heart could be restarted by stimulation\u2014and led \neventually to invention of the pacemaker.\nTo develop a product that will ultimately become a market success, bottom-up idea generation \nmust address a viable market opportunity. Innovative technology is not in itself a good reason for \ndeveloping a new offering. New technologies can, of course, contribute to market success, but the \nkey driver of success is the company\u2019s ability to parlay this technology into a product that effectively \naddresses an unmet market need. For example, the iPod was not the first Mp3 player that featured a \nhard drive that could store a great number of songs. Such devices were available on the market prior \nto the iPod, many at a lower price. Yet only when Apple launched the iPod did the entire category of \nhard-drive-based portable music players explode.\nTo turn a technological invention into a viable business idea, the company must identify an unmet \ncustomer need that this invention can address better than the competition. Thus, even though success -\nful products can spring from technological invention, top-down innovation is the preferable method of idea \ngeneration .

This process \ninvolves assessing the offering\u2019s desirability  and viability  based on whether the offering is likely to \n successfully address an important unmet customer need (idea desirability) in a way that will simul -\ntaneously benefit the company (idea viability).\nCompanies are prone to two types of errors when they evaluate proposed ideas for new offer -\nings. The first error involves the failure to reject an idea that has little or no merit, which will probably \nresult in an unsuccessful market offering. The second error is based on an opposite miscalculation\u2014\nthe rejection of a good idea. The high rate of new-product failures might lead to the conclusion that \nfailure to reject bad ideas is more prevalent than rejecting promising ideas. This is not necessarily the \ncase. Many new-product failures can undoubtedly be attributed to poor ideas, but the steep rate of \nsuch failures can also be caused by a high incidence of rejecting good ideas (Figure 18.2), along with \nthe many technological and market risks inherent in new-product development. A good idea that is \npoorly executed also runs the risk of failure.\nThe growth projections of many companies have been held hostage to the erroneous belief that it \nwould be an easy task to educate customers to appreciate the benefits of offerings that did not address \na problem (pain point) they faced. TiVo is a prime example. The company introduced the first digital \nvideo recorder at the turn of this century, fully anticipating that it would revolutionize the television \nindustry and that customers would be quick to adopt it. The TV revolution did materialize, but at a \ndistinctly slower rate than the company predicted. After the competition moved in, TiVo was left with \na sliver of the digital video recording market. TiVo\u2019s miscalculation: failing to understand that consum -\ners were fairly satisfied with the way they watched TV and did not see the value of TiVo\u2019s offering or \nfeel a strong urge to acquire it. For consumers, it was a nice-to-have product, but they did not feel the \nneed to have it.\nMARKET RESEARCH TOOLS FOR IDEA GENERATION \nAND\u00a0VALIDATION\nExploratory research is a mainstay of idea generation and validation.10 This form of research helps \nto identify unmet customer needs, formulate research questions (hypotheses), and generate ideas. \nTypically used in the initial stages of new-product development, exploratory research strives to attain \na general understanding of available market opportunities, rather than quantifying the obtained \ninsights or establishing causal relationships. Common market research tools for idea generation and \nvalidation involve observing and interviewing customers, interviewing employees and experts, analyzing the com -\npetition, and crowdsourcing .\n\u2022 Observing customers.  Examining people\u2019s behavior in their natural environment can be \nan effective way to gain insights into customer needs and determine how best to address these \nneeds. This can include observing both physical and online behavior\u2014such as the way customers \n evaluate, buy, and consume the products and services they use, the websites they visit, the content \non which they focus the most, and the information they share online.\n\u2022 Interviewing customers.  Questioning customers to uncover their unmet needs and gather \ninsights about novel ways in which these needs can be fulfilled is a logical place to start the search \nfor new ideas. After all, customer acceptance is a key factor in the success of a new offering. Yet, \neven though customers are an important source for generating new ideas, they are not always \nable to articulate their needs clearly and suggest viable new products. As Henry Ford famously \nsaid, \u201cIf I\u2019d asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.\u201d Being overly \nfocused on consumers who may not really know what they want, or what is possible, can result \nin shortsighted product development and miss potential breakthroughs. This is one of the reasons \nwhy some companies, including Apple and IKEA, tend to take consumer input with a grain of FIGURE 18.2 \nWhy Good Ideas Fail: \nForces Fighting New \nIdeas\nSource: With permission of Jer -\nold Panas, Young & Partners Inc.\"It's not the way\nwe do things.\"\n\"We've done all\nright without it.\"\"I've got a great idea!\"\n\"We've tried it before.\"\n\"This isn't the right time.\"\n\"Let's discuss it at\nour next meeting.\"", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4717, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be5775a9-309a-460f-8cfc-7031ec056fb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "be5775a9-309a-460f-8cfc-7031ec056fb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cd75dd8-e60f-495f-9ae0-6f82bd1d67af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "20a87383f15c77ee1a5f285fa3fa1fd957d68bb68b1676c33a8c091280f2a4eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94298395-3dc4-44be-9e4e-e9959b299f98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "ae0afe80b81a4fa57067d4eaa0709ff917b3b8829c1e1948240755645d5c3b4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "66c54ca2-deb7-4c5c-a248-b1048ca1dae8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a92393ca25b6614bb4a64ccfb53808bd180ab985dc23e4ef8cbb78158ccbb1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "406 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nsalt in the belief that focusing on customers\u2019 current needs can lead to incremental rather than \nbreakthrough innovation.11\n\u2022 Interviewing employees.  Employees can be a source of ideas for developing new products and \nservices. For example, Toyota reports that its employees submit 2 million ideas annually (about \n35 suggestions per employee), over 85 percent of which are implemented. LinkedIn launched an \nin-house incubator that allows any employee to organize a team and pitch a project to a group \nof executives. The company has also created \u201chackdays\u201d\u2014one Friday a month when employees \nwork on creative projects.\n\u2022 Interviewing experts.  Encouraged by the open innovation movement, many firms are going \noutside their boundaries to tap external sources of new ideas, including scientists, engineers, pat -\nent attorneys, university and commercial laboratories, industrial consultants and publications, \nchannel members, marketing and advertising agencies, and even competitors.\n\u2022 Analyzing the competition.  Companies can find good ideas by researching the products \nand services of other companies, discovering what customers like and dislike about these prod -\nucts. In addition, they can acquire competitors\u2019 products, reverse-engineer them, and design \nbetter ones. Knowing competitors\u2019 strengths and weaknesses can help the company establish \nthe optimal brand positioning for a new product and the right points of parity and points of \ndifferences.12\n\u2022 Crowdsourcing.  The traditional company-driven approach to product innovation is giving \nway to a world in which companies are turning to crowdsourcing to generate new ideas and \nto co-create products with consumers. Crowdsourcing  lets companies engage outsiders in \nthe new-product development process in rich and meaningful ways and receive either unique \nexpertise or a different perspective on the problem that might otherwise be overlooked.13 For \nexample, when Baskin-Robbins ran an online contest to pick its next flavor, 40,000 consumers \nentered. The winning entry combined chocolate, nuts, and caramel and was launched as Toffee \nPecan Crunch.14\nBecause different methods have their own advantages and shortcomings, companies often \nuse combined approaches to generate new ideas. For example, when Procter & Gamble was \nlooking to create a dishwashing detergent \u201csmart enough\u201d to reveal when the right amount of \nsoap has been added to a sink full of dirty plates, it reached out to a global network of volunteer \ntinkerers, including professionals, retired scientists, and students. As it happened, an Italian \nchemist working from her home laboratory had pioneered a new kind of dye that turns dishwater \nblue when a certain amount of soap is added. For $30,000 in prize money, the company had a \nsolution.15\nConcept Development\nConcept development embodies a potentially viable idea by creating an initial version, or prototype, \nof the company\u2019s offering. The prototype  is a working model of the offering that aims to flesh out the \noriginal idea and weed out potential problems before the actual offering is created. Concept develop -\nment improves the chances of market success by evaluating consumer response to the offering\u2019s core \nbenefits in order to create a product with maximum market potential.\nPROTOTYPING\nConcept development typically evolves from a description of the product\u2019s core features into the \nscaled-down prototype that introduces the offering\u2019s core concepts to target consumers.

As such, the prototype addresses only the most \nimportant aspect(s) of the potentially viable product or service.\nThe complexity of prototypes can vary widely.

Other prototypes might be much more \nadvanced and may at times even approach the final version of the offering.\nThe level of prototype complexity is usually geared to various stages of the new-product develop -\nment process. During the idea-generation and concept-development stages of the offering, simpler, \nmore basic prototypes usually suffice. On the other hand, the more advanced stages of product devel -\nopment typically call for more refined prototypes. This is particularly true when the validated product \nconcept is almost ready to be translated into a marketable offering.16\nFirms rigorously test prototypes to see how they perform in different applications and to ensure \nthat the final product will be well received in the market. There are two types of prototype tests: alpha \ntesting , which involves an evaluation of the product within the firm, and beta testing , which tests \nthe product with customers.\nFor example, Vibram, which makes soles for different types of shoes designed for sports that \ninclude skateboarding, cycling, and rock climbing, employs a team of experts to alpha test its products. \nThe company evaluates its products under the most extreme conditions by executing tests directly \nin the field and employing a series of procedures. One Vibram executive described the way it tests \nproducts:\nIf our chemist creates a new compound targeted towards road running applications, first \nwe perform a battery of lab tests to understand the compound\u2019s physical properties.  \nNext, we bring natural environments and surfaces into the laboratory and calculate \n information. Then lastly shoes are distributed to our tester team who will document \nthings like weather/temp, distance, location, and running surfaces, etc. They\u2019ll comment \non the differences in the grip of the soles. We then compile the results and make a decision  \non validation.17\nBeta testing can bring consumers into a laboratory or give them samples to use at home. Procter \n& Gamble has on-site labs such as a diaper-testing center where dozens of parents bring their babies \nto take part in the studies. To develop its Cover Girl Outlast all-day lip color, Procter & Gamble invited \n500 women to come to its labs each morning to apply the lipstick, record their activities, and return \neight hours later in order that the remaining lip color could be measured. This resulted in a product \nthat included a glossy moisturizer women could apply on top of the color without looking in a mirror. \nMicrosoft has an \u201cInsider Program\u201d that rolls out versions of its new products months in advance to \ncustomers and developers who might be interested in what the next iteration of the Windows operat -\ning system will look like.\nBusiness products can also benefit from market testing. Expensive industrial goods and new \ntechnologies normally undergo alpha and beta testing. During beta testing, the company\u2019s technical \npeople observe how customers use the product, a practice that often exposes unanticipated problems \nof safety and servicing and alerts the company to customer training and servicing requirements. The \ncompany can also observe how much value the equipment adds to a customer\u2019s operation as an input \nto subsequent pricing.\nCONCEPT VALIDATION\nConcept validation  typically assesses the soundness of the core concept underlying the proposed \noffering by addressing the technological feasibility  of the offering and the way target customers view its \ndesirability.  Thus, to validate the concept, a manager should answer two key questions: Can a functional \nprototype and, later, a fully functional version of the offering be built?  and Does it fulfill the identified customer \nneed better than the alternative options?\nConcept development and validation are typically guided by experimental studies designed to \ntest the prototypes produced by the company. To this end, a study might involve varying one or more \naspects of the prototype and observing the effect of these changes on customers\u2019 reactions to the \noffering\u2014a process also referred to as A/B testing. Based on the outcome of the experiment, the com -\npany either proceeds to develop a business model for the offering or goes back to the drawing board \nto formulate new ideas and concepts that incorporate the knowledge gained from the test. Another \ncommonly used approach is conjoint analysis , which involves asking respondents to evaluate a series \nof different combinations of attributes of an offering in order to determine the value that consumers \nplace on specific attributes of this offering.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4693, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8ef9ef1-c943-4b68-9aa5-7ef11b36a3f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8ef9ef1-c943-4b68-9aa5-7ef11b36a3f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebd5df1f-bf42-43f9-b79a-26bf59fb21b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "f0c62b8c00e2c1acaca3f7511af12506044018bdb88ad1368344b0e7b7405c27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66c54ca2-deb7-4c5c-a248-b1048ca1dae8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "ba21550656c7d7f4541733194738a40d4200a9c1b1a08c612852c332f7394ed1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7fb7068-8181-4187-9dd2-5f79ebd0d346", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32ef90bcc0136f8f5d4f93bb846d8296d49099e3b9aff47b898fd73f2139499d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "408 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nBusiness-Model Design\nUp to this point, the product has existed only in the form of a description, a drawing, or a proto -\ntype. The next step represents a jump in investment that dwarfs the costs incurred so far, requiring \nthe company to determine whether the product idea can be translated into a commercially feasible \noffering. Business-model design  also takes the offering\u2019s viability \u2014its value-creating capacity\u2014into \nconsideration, in addition to concept development\u2019s focus on the technological feasibility  and the desir -\nability  of the offering. If the business model is validated, the concept can move to the development \nstage. If the business-model analysis suggests that the offering is unlikely to create market value for \nthe company and its customers, the offering concept (and sometimes the underlying idea) must be \nrevised and reevaluated.\nDESIGNING THE BUSINESS MODEL\nDesigning the business model involves three key components\u00a0(discussed in detail in Chapter 2 ): iden -\ntifying the target market, articulating the offering\u2019s value proposition in that market, and delineating \nthe key attributes of the market offering (Figure 18.3):\n\u2022 The target market  is the market in which the company has chosen to create value with its offer -\ning. Included in the target market are the target customers that the company has identified as \npotential purchasers of the offering, competitors that are also vying for the target customers, col -\nlaborators that will help the company distribute the offering and serve the target customers, the \ncompany itself, and the context of the market in which the company operates.\n\u2022 The value proposition  details the type of value that the company plans to create for its target \ncustomers and collaborators in the market, as well as the way in which the company plans to \ncapture some of this value for itself.\n\u2022 The market offering  describes how the company will create, communicate, and deliver value \nto its target customers, collaborators, and the company stakeholders. This involves specifying \nthe product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and distribution aspects of the \ncompany\u2019s offering.\nThe creation of market value is the ultimate goal of the business model. Accordingly, the success \nof an offering is determined by the degree to which it can create value for its target customers, col -\nlaborators, and the company. Thus, the design of a business model for a new offering is guided by three \nkey questions: Does the offering create value for target customers? Does the offering create value for the company \ncollaborators?  and Does the offering create value for the company?\nFIGURE 18.3 \nThe key Components \nof a Business Model \nof a New Offering\nSource: Alexander Chernev, \nStrategic Marketing Management: \nTheory and Practice  (Chicago, IL: \nCerebellum Press, 2019)\nTarget market Market offering\nCustomers\n Product\nService\nBrand\nPrice\nIncentives\nCommunication\nDistributionCompany\nContext\nValue propositionCompetitorsCollaborators\nCollaborator valueCustomer value\nCompany value", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3100, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7fb7068-8181-4187-9dd2-5f79ebd0d346": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7fb7068-8181-4187-9dd2-5f79ebd0d346", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7010ff96-29c6-47ac-aa91-f013785f9008", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "1ec206d3e02ae447694ce1e91dffcf0bc6efc55ed45abce0bee009c99e757465", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8ef9ef1-c943-4b68-9aa5-7ef11b36a3f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "f0c62b8c00e2c1acaca3f7511af12506044018bdb88ad1368344b0e7b7405c27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5786e92d-fba7-4f13-8901-61056dcc3864", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d76e00b0c461704abd7c497ee475455dd25f652a41e64d2c941f400e5204680e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 18    |  DEvELOPING  NEW MARkET OFFERINGS  409\nThe key principles involved in developing the value proposition and the process of creating cus -\ntomer, company, and collaborator value were discussed in detail in Chapter 2.\nBUSINESS-MODEL VALIDATION\nBusiness-model validation aims to assess the offering\u2019s ability to create market value on three key \ndimensions: desirability, feasibility, and viability.\n\u2022 Desirability  indicates the extent to which target customers perceive the offering to be attractive. \nThe desirability of an offering hinges on its ability to deliver the benefits sought by customers \nat a reasonable expenditure of money, time, and effort. The inability to achieve an optimal bal -\nance of benefits and costs can hinder an offering\u2019s desirability. An example is Crystal Pepsi, a \nclear, caffeine-free alternative to regular colas: The offering failed to gain traction in the market, \ndespite a massive promotional campaign, because consumers did not find the concept of clear \ncola appealing.\n\u2022 Feasibility  indicates the extent to which the company can create an offering that delivers the func -\ntionality desired by customers. Feasibility hinges on both current technologies and a company\u2019s \nexpertise in using these technologies. For example, a perpetual motion machine that can operate \nindefinitely without an energy source is not a feasible concept.\n\u2022 Viability  indicates the extent to which an offering can create value for the company. For most \ncompanies, a viable offering is one that is able to generate profits. Thus, viability is typically a func -\ntion of expected revenues and the cost structure of an offering; an inability to balance revenues \nand costs often is an indication of impending market failure. Pets.com lost money on most sales \nand ultimately was unable to stay in business despite high name recognition and a high-profile \npromotional campaign.\nBecause a company\u2019s success is based on the desirability, feasibility, and viability of its offerings, \nto create a sustainable business model a manager must answer the following three questions: Do target \ncustomers find the offering desirable, and does it create value for these customers? Is it feasible for the offering to be built \nas planned?  and Is the offering viable\u2014that is, able to create value for the company and its collaborators?\nAn offering\u2019s desirability, feasibility, and viability are interrelated. An offering that customers do \nnot find desirable would probably not be viable because it would not create sufficient customer demand \nto create value for the company. An offering that is not technologically feasible would be likely to prove \nundesirable because it would not be able to meet customer needs.\nAn important aspect of validating a company\u2019s business model in general, and an offering\u2019s viabil -\nity in particular, is ensuring that the offering addresses a need that is perceived to be important to a cus -\ntomer segment is large enough to create value for the company. In this context, demand forecasting\u2014a \nprocess that involves identifying the size of the potential market for the company\u2019s offering\u2014is an \nintegral aspect of developing new offerings.18\nDemand forecasts  are built on one of three information bases: what people say, what people do, \nor what people have done. Using what people say requires surveying buyers\u2019 intentions, composites of \nsales force opinions, and expert opinions. Building a forecast on the basis of what people do means put -\nting the product into a test market to measure buyer response. To use the final basis\u2014what people have \ndone\u2014firms analyze records of past buying behavior or use time-series analysis or statistical demand \nanalysis. Different approaches to demand forecasting are discussed in detail later in this chapter.\nOffering Implementation\nImplementing the offering turns the concept into a reality. It involves two key aspects: developing the \nnecessary resources  to put the business model into action and developing the market offering .\nDEVELOPING THE CORE RESOURCES\nTo succeed, a company must have the necessary resources to implement its business model. Often, at \nthe time a company develops the offering\u2019s concept and designs its business model, it does not have \nall of the resources necessary to create and launch the market offering. Thus, after the business model \nhas been designed, the logical next step is to develop the necessary resources by building, outsourc -\ning, or acquiring them.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4496, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5786e92d-fba7-4f13-8901-61056dcc3864": {"__data__": {"id_": "5786e92d-fba7-4f13-8901-61056dcc3864", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c39d87f-f1e4-411a-82fa-1462f4dbf8b6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "b496b4bd7f64274aacd7c2c3771c6c684eba5a4433b0e3e843a6054557ef9ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7fb7068-8181-4187-9dd2-5f79ebd0d346", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap18.pdf"}, "hash": "a74c56de9db3ce1e995d14945e6f95beefbc824a03fcd8b9841e645bbe2e3a21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10824506-cf36-4040-98ba-b803b4ee8be9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "268ccfe03c2de2c4b3da3e36c7e20c6520ad065017b8025698bfcb552d8917e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "410 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nResources required to launch a new offering involve factors such as business facilities  that include \nprocuring and preparing manufacturing equipment, creating call centers to service customers, and \ndeveloping an information technology infrastructure; supply channels  to obtain the materials needed to \ncreate the offering; distribution channels  through which the offering will be delivered to target customers; \nskilled employees  who can contribute the required technological, operational, and business expertise; and \naccess to capital  to secure the financial resources needed to implement the business model.\nTo gain the resources needed to successfully launch the new offering, a company might adopt \none of two different strategies. First, the company might create its own resources either by internally \ndeveloping its assets and capabilities or by acquiring the necessary resources from a third party. Alter -\nnatively, rather than building its own resources, a company might choose to collaborate with other \nentities that have the resources required to help develop, manufacture, distribute, and promote the \noffering, and leverage these resources without assuming ownership of them.\nDEVELOPING THE MARKET OFFERING\nDeveloping the market offering involves turning the prototype into a market-ready commodity. This \ninvolves not only creating the final product and service but also building the brand, setting both retail \nand wholesale prices, determining the type of sales promotions to be used, and developing a plan to \neffectively communicate the benefits of the offering and make it available to target customers.\nThe development of an offering often involves advanced prototyping and market testing to ensure \nthat the offering will succeed in creating market value. The amount of prototyping and testing needed \nis influenced by a variety of factors, such as product novelty, product complexity, and the investment \nrequired to modify the offering after it has been launched. New-to-the-world products warrant more \nmarket testing than products that involve slight modifications from what is already available in the \nmarket. More complex products are more likely than simpler products to benefit from market testing. \nProducts that will require high levels of investment in modification after launch (e.g., retooling the \nmanufacturing plant to modify the design of a car) are in greater need of advance prototyping and \nmarket testing than products that can be modified relatively easily post launch.\nAn important decision involved in test marketing is determining in which markets and with which \ncustomers the offering should be tested. A number of considerations come into play for this decision. \nMany major global consumer-goods makers such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Philips, and Nikon like to test in South \nKorea because its consumers are known to be demanding but fair-minded, and its well-developed \nmarketing infrastructure helps ensure that products are in good enough shape to enter other global \nmarkets. Gucci tests many of its luxury products in China because consumer preferences there are \nindicative of where the luxury market is heading.\nMany companies skip test marketing despite its benefits and rely on faster and more economical \ntesting methods. Starbucks regularly launches products before they have been deemed \u201cperfect,\u201d based \non the philosophy espoused by chief digital officer Adam Brotman: \u201cWe don\u2019t think it is okay if things \naren\u2019t perfect, but we\u2019re willing to innovate and have speed to market trump a 100% guarantee that it\u2019ll \nbe perfect.\u201d The company\u2019s mobile payments app had a number of flaws that needed correcting dur -\ning its first six months after launch, but it now generates three million mobile transactions a week.19 \nGeneral Mills prefers to launch new products in 25 percent of the country, an area too large for rivals \nto disrupt. Managers review retail scanner data, which tells them within days how the product is doing \nand what corrective fine-tuning is needed.\nWhen developing a new offering, a company can create a fully functional, full-scale version of the \nproduct prior to launching it in the market. Alternatively, a company might develop a streamlined ver -\nsion that incorporates only features that are essential to fulfilling the customer need. The development \nof a streamlined version of the offering\u2014referred to as a minimum viable offering\u2014 enables the company \nto test the offering\u2019s market performance before proceeding to develop the full-scale offering.\nCommercial Deployment\nCommercialization  informs target customers about the company\u2019s offering and makes the offering \navailable to these customers. Because large-scale rollouts are characterized by greater uncertainty and \nhigher costs, companies often choose to launch the offering in a few select markets before making \nit available to all target customers.

In addition to enhanc -\ning agility, selective market deployment requires fewer company resources to launch the offering and \nhas the potential to bring in revenues to help defray the cost of the subsequent market expansion.\nThe subset of target customers to which the offering will initially be made available is referred to \nas the primary target . The primary target typically involves customers who are most likely to buy \nthe company\u2019s offering and who will help the company to refine the offering and generate an initial \nstream of revenue.\nSome products catch on immediately (roller blades), whereas others take a long time to gain accep -\ntance (diesel engine autos).

Realizing there were far too many unused tickets for \nsporting events, theater events, and concerts, they decided to set up an \u201ceBay for tickets\u201d where \nsellers could set a price higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. StubHub would \ntake a 10 percent cut from the buyer and a 15 percent cut from the seller on every purchase. The \nservice had to negotiate state laws restricting ticket reselling, but by 2006 it was making $100 \nmillion in revenue, split between sports (75 percent), concerts (20 percent), and theater (5 percent) \nin a market estimated to be worth $4 billion in the United States.

During market expansion, a company typically moves upstream \non the path of least resistance and the path of least resources to attract customers who are more dif -\nficult to reach and who are less likely to recognize the value of the company\u2019s offering. As a result, the \ncompany will probably expend more time, effort, and resources during market expansion than during \ninitial market deployment.\nBroader markets usually involve a wider range of customers, which frequently necessitates \nintroducing variants of the offering to accommodate the different needs and preferences of all target \ncustomers. Thus, a company might enter the market with a single offering that appeals to its most \nlikely adopters, and then introduce variations that appeal to the wider range of customer needs within \nthe expanded target market. The increased assortment of company offerings associated with market \nexpansion, in turn, calls for additional resources to ensure the market success of these offerings.\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\nindividual adopts new ideas relatively earlier or later than \nother consumers.

They are unlike enthusiasts in \nthat they do not adopt technological innovations \nfor their own sake. And they differ from visionaries \nin that they apply technology to enhance existing \nbusiness models rather than to change them.\n\u2022 Conservatives  (late majority) are pessimistic about \nderiving significant benefits from emerging tech -\nnological innovations and thus are slow to adopt \nthem.\n\u2022 Skeptics  (laggards) tend to be very critical of tech -\nnological innovations and are unlikely to adopt them \ndespite their benefits.\nRogers\u2019 model assumes that the adoption of \ninnovations is a continuous process and that after the \ninnovation reaches market saturation in one segment, it \nwill roll over into the next segment. Moore\u2019s model, on \nthe other hand, argues that the adoption of innovations \nis a discontinuous process involving certain \u201cgaps\u201d \nand that the adoption of an innovation by one segment \ndoes not necessarily mean that the innovation will be \nadopted by another segment. This is because different \nconsumer groups exhibit different patterns of adoption, \neach of which requires a different marketing strategy. \nFor example, the fact that technology enthusiasts  \nhave embraced an innovation does not imply that  \nit will be widely adopted by visionaries, who may  \nview the technological innovation in a completely  \ndifferent light.\nMoore defines the largest gap in the innovation-\nadoption process as the one that exists between the \nearly adopters, the segment made up of technology \nenthusiasts and visionaries, and the mainstream market \nof technology pragmatists, conservatives, and skeptics. \nHe defines this as the \u201cchasm\u201d and views it as the most \nsignificant challenge in developing technology innova -\ntions and the key hurdle that technology pioneers must \novercome if they are to succeed in having their offerings \nwidely accepted.23sensitive and are willing to adopt the product if given \npersonalized solutions and good service support. \nEarly adopters are defined as the 13.5 percent of \nadopters following the innovators.\n\u2022 The early majority  includes deliberate pragmatists \nwho adopt the new technology after its benefits have \nbeen proved and much adoption has already taken \nplace. The early majority makes up the mainstream \nmarket and includes the next 34 percent of adopters.\n\u2022 The late majority  encompasses skeptical conserva-\ntives who are risk averse, technology shy, and price \nsensitive. The late majority consists of the next 34 \npercent of adopters following the early majority.\n\u2022 Laggards  are tradition bound and resist an innova-\ntion until the status quo is no longer defensible. The \nlaggards make up the remaining 16 percent of the \nadopter population.\nEach group requires a different type of marketing \nif the firm wants to move its innovation through the full \nproduct life cycle.

Furthermore, because individuals are assigned \nto one of the five categories based on relatively stable \npersonality traits, this model does not account for the fact \nthat a customer who is an innovator in one domain might \nbe a laggard in another.

Designing the business model  involves three key \ncomponents: identifying the target market, articulating \nthe offering\u2019s value proposition in that market, and \ndelineating the key attributes of the market offering. \nThe target market delineates the market in which a \ncompany\u2019s offering aims to create value.

Two popular frameworks examine customers\u2019 reaction \nto new offerings. Rogers\u2019 model  depicts the number \nof new adoptions, rather than total adoptions, at \na given point in time and divides customers into \nfive categories\u2014innovators, early adopters, early \nmajority, late majority, and laggards\u2014based on \nthe timing of new-product adoption. Building on \nRogers\u2019 model, Moore\u2019s model  argues that in the case of \ntechnology products, the adoption of innovations is \na discontinuous process marked by distinct adoption \ngaps, the largest of which is the gap between the \nearly adopters (enthusiasts and visionaries) and the \nmainstream market.summary\n1. Innovation is the key to developing viable new \nofferings. Innovation can involve a new technology, \na new approach to brand building, a new pricing \nmechanism, a new way of managing incentives, new \nchannels of communication, or a novel distribution \nmethod. Innovative offerings disrupt existing business \nmodels and make companies that fail to adapt to \nchanging market conditions superfluous by devising \nnew ways to create market value.\n2. Successful new-product development requires the \ncompany to establish an effective organization for \nmanaging the development process, which can \ninclude product managers (of either the new product \nor existing products), committees, departments, or \nventure teams. Increasingly, companies are adopting \ncross-functional teams, connecting to individuals \nand organizations outside the company through \ncrowdsourcing and other means, and developing \nmultiple product concepts.\n3. New-product development is an iterative process  of \ndiscovering a novel idea and translating this idea \ninto a viable, successful market offering. New-\nproduct development is represented as a sequence \nof actions (stages) separated by hurdles (gates) that \nthe new offering must overcome. The stage-gate \napproach divides the innovation process into five key \nstages\u2014 idea generation , concept development , business-model \ndesign , offering development , and commercial deployment \u2014\nseparated by gates that serve to validate the actions \ntaken in the previous step.\n4. Innovation begins with generating an idea  that pinpoints \nan unmet market need and suggests a novel way to \naddress this need. There are two basic methods of idea \ngeneration: top-down idea generation, which begins \nwith identifying a market opportunity, and bottom-up \nidea generation, which starts with an invention and \nthen seeks to identify an unmet market need that it \nwill satisfy. Top-down idea generation is the preferred \napproach for developing new offerings.\n5. Concept development  embodies a potentially viable idea \nby creating an initial version, or prototype, of the \ncompany\u2019s offering. Concept development aims to \nreduce market and implementation risk by designing \nthe offering in an expeditious and resource-efficient \nway.

WeChat is primarily used for messaging and com -\nmunication, similar to Facebook and WhatsApp, and com -\nbines the functionality of apps like Twitter, PayPal, Reddit, \nand Uber. Users can also play video games, send money, \nvoice chat, read news, share posts, order a taxi, and much \nmore. WeChat\u2019s user base consists of over one billion daily \nactive users, including companies, celebrities, and even \nhospitals that use the application as a promotional platform. \nMany Chinese cannot imagine life without this ubiquitous \napplication.\nWeChat began in 2010 as a social media and instant \nmessaging application for smart phones. CEO Ma Huateng \nrecognized that the future dominant platform for social \nmedia and messaging would be mobile phones rather \nthan personal computers. He tasked an engineering team \nof fewer than 10 members to develop the first version of \nWeChat. The prototype version was capable only of sending \ntext messages and pictures. Because instant messengers \nand SMS texting applications already existed with these \nfeatures, consumers initially didn\u2019t see the app\u2019s value. \nWeChat\u2019s reception changed in May 2011 when the team \nupgraded the app to support voice messaging, which \nappealed to adults who were not used to typing on smart \nphones. Chinese businesspeople also found the increased \nfunctionality useful.\nWeChat\u2019s user base skyrocketed in 2012 to over \n100\u00a0million. There were two main reasons for this. First, \noverall Chinese smart-phone unit sales grew exponentially. \nIn 2010, there were over 35 million smart-phone unit sales; \nby 2012, smart-phone unit sales had increased over fivefold \nto more than 210 million, which meant that a greater number \nof users were able to download and utilize the app. Second, \nWeChat growth was fueled by several innovations and fea-\ntures that provided a better user experience compared to \ncompetitor applications. WeChat introduced unique features \nlike Shake, which randomly connected users who were shak-\ning their phones at the same time, and Message in a Bottle, \nwhich allowed users to send messages to random recipients. \nWeChat\u2019s expanded platform also allowed users to read and \nshare blog posts on Official Accounts and play games on the \ngaming platform. Competitor services like Feixin did not offer \ntheir application to users who did not have China Mobile, and \nMiTalk failed to provide a stable user experience, so WeChat \novertook the messaging and social media market.\nSource: Piotr Swat/Alamy Stock Photo\nWeChat added payments to the platform in 2013. \nInitially, WeChat Pay was limited to microtransactions for \ngames, virtual items for avatars, and mobile subscriptions. \nTencent later expanded the payment platform and created \nWeChat Wallet, which lets users pay for goods and services \nat certified merchants and transfer money to other users. \nFour years after its introduction, WeChat Pay had over \n600\u00a0million users.\nWeChat Pay has improved the way Chinese users give \neach other hongbao, red envelopes filled with money, a pop-\nular tradition for the Lunar New Year. Users of the WeChat \nRed Packet can send their friends and loved ones hongbao in \nfun and addictive ways. For example, a user can put $5 from \nher or his WeChat Wallet into a virtual red envelope and have \nit distributed equally among five friends. Users can also have \nthe first two recipients who tap the screen split the money in \nequal proportions or in a random cut. Red Packet became a \nmassive success during the 2014 Lunar New Year, with more \nthan 40 million hongbao sent to 8 million recipients. WeChat\u2019s \nRed Packet has grown to become a messaging medium in \nitself, with Chinese users frequently sending each other yuan \namounts that have special meanings. For example, the num-\nber \u201c520\u201d is Chinese slang for \u201cI love you.\u201d\nOne of WeChat\u2019s biggest selling points was the \nimplementation of mini programs  within the application. Mini \nprograms, introduced in 2017, are best described as apps \nwithin the WeChat app. Mini programs are typically less \nthan 10 megabytes that run instantly on WeChat without \nhaving to be downloaded from an app store.
