The \nwater would always be chosen as the priority over food.\nAs the observations continued, a \npattern emerged. Maslow could see, on \na physiological level, that if the mon-\nkeys didn\u2019t have food, but had water, the group was less aggressive than \nthose that had the water taken away \nfrom them.\n1 The same held true with \nsafety needs. If all of the physiologi-\ncal needs were met, then the monkeys\u2019 \nbehavior became more profound when \nit came to establishing social roles and \ndominance.\nMaslow later transitioned this idea \nover to human behavior and was able to establish physiological needs over \nsafety needs, safety needs over belongingness needs, belong-ingness needs over esteem needs, and esteem needs. The needs, in turn, form the first four components of the pyra-\nmid, and are addressed as deficit needs. Self-actualization, \nthe fifth component, addresses the need of being, which defines one\u2019s own place in the universe. \nWhen an individual does not have enough of something, \nhe or she has a deficit, ultimately creating what Maslow has \ntermed \u201cdeficit needs.\u201d\n1 When individuals eat and drink, \nfor example, the need for water and food is met, so there is no longer a motivating factor to obtain water or food, \nand the deficit need has temporarily been satisfied.

Being needs are internal, and are at the very top of \nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy pyramid, which ties into self-actualiza-\ntion.\n2 An example here might be drawing one\u2019s own conclu-\nsions of where and who he or she is spiritually.

Despite its relative fragility, the human body can live for many years. Every single detail is so integral, from how the body processes oxygen through millions and millions of tissue cells, to the thousands of miles of arteries that carry blood and nutrients to those tis-sues. With this being said, there is still the need to meet the very basic essentials of life: the body must take on oxygen, water and food. Before any further growth can take place, this very basic need has to be met. This is what Maslow addresses as a physiological need\u2014the need for the body to work in unison to accomplish the task of basic survival. \nPhysiological needs are influenced generally through the \ncravings that we have. If a person is thirsty, he or she finds a drinking fountain. Similarly, if the individual is hungry, he or she will find food. If the body is being deprived of oxygen, it will surely react. If there is a vitamin deficiency, the body has subtle ways of fulfilling that need.\nOne example of how the body regulates itself on a physi-\nological level is by homeostasis. Homeostasis simply means to regulate. A part of the human brain, called the hypothala-mus, plays an important role in keeping the body regulated by controlling the body\u2019s thermostat, which is controlled by the release of several hormones called gonadotropins. \nIf a female produces too much estrogen, the hypothala-\nmus releases a hormone called luteinizing hormone that triggers ovulation, therefore acting like a shut-off switch for the amount of estrogen present. If the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxin, the hypothalamus produces a hormone to switch off the flow of the thyroxin. These are \njust a few examples of homeostasis at work, however, there \nare many circulatory hormones that are needed to maintain normal bodily functions.\nAnother prime example is the release of the \u201cfight or \nflight\u201d hormones that are secreted by the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands. If there is a need for the body to defend itself, these hormones will surge into action to prepare the body for fight or flight. These hormones, although they play an important role, are kept in compliance by regulatory mechanisms within the brain.\n3\nThroughout life, the idea of physiological needs remains \nconsistent. The need to maintain adequate physiological balance will always be essential, and may kick into action in very different ways at various different times, whether the individuals experiencing it are aware of it or not. For example, how would anyone ever get a good night\u2019s sleep if they had to literally think about their breathing pattern, heart rate or blood pressure on a conscious level? Sure some people may have to get up during the night to use the rest-room or grab a glass of water, but remember that this is all part of how the body regulates itself.\nThe notion that physiological needs tie into other, more \ncomplex needs of the hierarchy is very relevant. Maslow \nThroughout life, the idea of physiological \nneeds remains consistent. The need to main-tain adequate physiological balance will always be essential\u2026 \nThe basic principles of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy have  \nbeen observed in primates.\n\u00a9 2009 \nAssociation of Surgical Technologists \nFor reprint permission: publications@ast.org", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3574, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab43533d-7953-4fcf-8628-425e3d128e69": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab43533d-7953-4fcf-8628-425e3d128e69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6d0cdfa-b48d-4632-9971-9b78e0532c9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "hash": "c9eeb530d13c81e3578a38253b48aaeb535002b183c09e620ce11b91e8ff7013", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b87d22f-e1e0-4fa9-a4be-0e1571e9c064", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "hash": "c6f13eb54b0fb8544c4b22f9721aee16e9de67ae8a008aa4e1e16947eedc1e36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a397077c-07c9-4d45-b1fa-4154a2b32aff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d733afd9b85beb2d866714f6b3ef195f78e9efee690d1a79b327db14cad11fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "|     the surgical technologist     |     AUGUST 2009   350believed that once the physiological needs are met in suf-\nficient detail, people move on to address these more com-\nplex needs. Safety and security make up the next platform \nof the pyramid.\nSA F E T Y  N E E D S\nMuch like physiological needs require maintenance \nthroughout life, so does the need to feel secure. This need is \nmore psychological. With that being said, safety needs may \nbe different for each individual, depending on where he or \nshe is in life. For a child, this need may manifest as the need \nfor a safe family environment.4 There has to be security in \nthe home, with warmth and love. When a family is dysfunc-\ntional, it makes it difficult for that child to move up to the \nnext level of social needs because fear is often present.\nFor adults, this need may be economic in nature. If a \nperson loses his or her job, for example, fear and anxiety will have an impact on that person\u2019s social life, and may \ncause him or her to regress.\n5 Additionally, adults are not \nimmune to the need of safety. In some parts of the world, where there is chaos, people are stuck at this level of need-\ning to feel safe. The goal of consistently meeting the need for \nsafety is to have stability in one\u2019s life. It is the idea of being \nable to walk around the block at night without the worry of being mugged. It is the idea of feeling secure in the work-\nplace. It is conclusive that fear hinders one\u2019s ability to move \non to the more advanced platforms of Maslow\u2019s pyramid. \nB\nE L O N G I N G  N E E D S\nAdvancing up the hierarchy pyramid, the next level repre-\nsents the need to belong on a social level. The social level generally becomes the priority only after the physiological \nand safety needs have been sufficiently met and maintained. \nA sense of belonging can be felt when an individual becomes more focused on the desire to build relationships with others. \nThis includes the desire for a romantic partner, to have close \nfriends, and maybe to get married and have children.\n1 Again, this need will change depending on where an \nindividual is in his or her life. For a young child, approval-\nseeking behaviors may become more commonplace. The \nchild may engage in activities to get his or her parents\u2019 atten-\ntion by exploring or asking lots of questions. In a sense, the \nchild needs to feel an emotional or social connection with his or her parents. As the child evolves into a teenager, he \nor she will more than likely become more socially active in \npeer groups. Generally, whatever gets reinforced, supported, \nor accepted by these peer groups will often determine which \ntype of group the adolescent will affiliate him or herself \nwith. This idea can be noticed at any \npoint throughout an individual\u2019s life. \nAs youths mature into adulthood, \nthey tend to affiliate with those indi-\nviduals or groups who accept them. \nA sense or a need to belong, at any \nstage, is influenced by several factors. Some of these influences, for example, are socio-economic influences: the \neducation level of parents and family, \nthe neighborhood in which the child grows up and the type of schools where they are educated, as well as the children \nwho attend those schools. Whatever type of behavior is learned and accepted, based on these variables, is likely the \nbehavior that will form a particular individual\u2019s character \nand self-esteem.\nThe level of belonging must be established because of its \neffect on one\u2019s self-esteem. If the level of belonging in the hierarchy model is low, or an individual is viewed negatively \nby peers in that group, he or she may develop social anxiety \nand may withdraw toward a level of people in which he or \nshe fits in socially.

Relieving any anxiety or fear will help put more emphasis on social development, and with this will come a healthier self-esteem. \nES T E E M  N E E D S\nO\nnce the needs of physiology, safety and belonging have \nbeen met, the individual will now move on to the needs of \ntheir self-esteem. Self-esteem, like all the prior needs, must also be maintained. This is the highest platform in the cate-gory of deficit needs.\n1 The process of growth, when address-\ning one\u2019s self-esteem, builds the bridge to one\u2019s awareness. Self-esteem begins to establish itself in life as early as age two. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy addresses two levels of self-esteem. One of those is a lower level and the other is a higher level. \nThe lower form of self-esteem is directly related to an \nindividual\u2019s ego, meaning that there is a strong need to be respected by others.\n4 Within this lower form, the individual \nstill remains focused on acceptance by others. This lower form of self-esteem is met when an individual has estab-lished a level of status, recognition, fame, reputation and appreciation, just to name a few. These areas in a person\u2019s life take work to maintain. They may also require some rein-forcement or validation of some kind in order for this lower form of self-esteem to be maintained.The higher form of self-esteem that Maslow address-\nes is that of self-respect. This higher form of self-esteem requires less maintenance because through accomplish-ment, it becomes a permanent part of who the individual is. We can say that once a person has gained respect for himself or herself, it is much harder to lose that respect or to have it taken away. People on the higher end of self-esteem generally like who they are. The idea of confidence in ability, the mastery of something, or the competence that is established in what these people do, supports this higher form of self-esteem. \nThese forms  of self-esteem should not be confused with \nan individual having  high or low self-esteem. Individuals \nwith low self-esteem often have a low opinion of themselves and their self-image. As a result, inferiority complexes are present in the individual. With this idea in mind, Maslow \ncontends that the majority of people\u2019s psychological problems are due to low self-esteem. The realism here is that if a person don\u2019t like himself or herself, or who he or she is or what he or she has accomplished, then that person will be more critical of himself or her-self. Through that process, negative self talk is born, and can create a barrier to achieving personal success.\nHow does low self-esteem  impact \nthese lower and higher forms of self-esteem in general? If an individual has low self-esteem, the lower form of self-esteem affects the individual on a social level. The individual may, for example, constantly attempt to seek \nor validate feedback and acceptance on a social level from his or her peers. With regard to the higher form of self-esteem, in the individual with low self-\nesteem may display a lack of respect for himself or herself and the expectations that they place upon themselves would be unrealistic, or perhaps in some cases these expectations would be placed by others rather than being placed by the individuals themselves.\nIt is amazing that all of the prior needs within Maslow\u2019s \nhierarchy, including physiological, safety, and even belong-ingness needs are frequently met, especially in modern soci-ety and developed countries. Imagine if more people just had a little respect for themselves in the grand scheme of things. \n                     Maslow\u2019s hierarchy is a two-way street. A person can spend a lifetime  \n                     traveling between the two extremes.\n\u00a9 2009 \nAssociation of Surgical Technologists \nFor reprint permission: publications@ast.org", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3976, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42aaa132-8d2d-4138-b16c-36db22799eff": {"__data__": {"id_": "42aaa132-8d2d-4138-b16c-36db22799eff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e6a9371-66cc-4c2e-9e2c-db059348dfe7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "hash": "f47431d62d984138597629113aaaf0701ee4cd259fd91f075023591412a682ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8625931a-33ab-439d-9922-13894302d9bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap26.pdf"}, "hash": "1b133e2dd1e4d2529e09998592e0e9f89664db685839d8b429f4689ee52b943f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1afcdc0e-8fff-4a73-930f-d19079e278b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b133ce58792f53e68b24818a38a686eb9868823e442b0d354a7d93d331bad77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "|     the surgical technologist     |     AUGUST 2009   352SE L F - A C T U A L I z A T I O N\nSelf-actualization is defined by Maslow as the single com-\nponent of being within the hierarchy model. Being, in this \nsense, means not being a part of the deficit needs as they \nappear within the lower chain of the hierarchy.1 This need \nis independent\u2014there must be some accomplishment of all the other deficit needs, which are best defined as what we \nappear to be, according to the standards of society. Self-\nactualization is the internal dialogue that everyone estab-\nlishes at some point in their lives. In order to do that, there must be some establishment or satisfaction of the prior \nneeds. Once all of the previous needs have been met, an \nindividual can direct his or her focus toward a true calling. \nUsually when a person is hungry, or they don\u2019t feel safe, or \nthey feel unloved, the focal point leans towards resolving those issues, therefore disrupting the focus on self-actualiz-\ning. With self-actualization, being able to pinpoint how one \ntruly feels about something is often a little more challenging \nto figure out, or it can be the determining factor of how well \nhe or she is connected with his or her self and abilities. \nPeople who are self-actualizers are focused on what \nmatters most in defining who they are. Once self-respect is \ngained, the individual can take a more proactive approach to bettering themselves, as well as being able to remain \nfocused on resolving any dilemmas that may arise regarding \nthe deficit stages. Self-actualizers may be more generative in \nthe sense that the focus is no longer as much about pleas-\ning others as it is giving back or sharing this part of who they are.\n6 In other aspects, it can also appear to be spiritual. \nLooking at one\u2019s life as to who he or she is in the universe \nis a good example. Once a person is able to come to terms \nwith who they are, and they are ultimately satisfied with \nthat, then they have truly reached the point of being able \nto self-actualize.\nWith this level of intuition comes a sense of peace, which \nin turn serves as a motivator to focus on more advanced tasks in life, such as supporting the moral and ethical stan-dards in life. There is a more in-depth focus on bettering \noneself and expanding one\u2019s knowledge and talents. The \nreal definition to self-actualizing is getting to know oneself, while being okay and unconditionally accepting of whatever \nit is that he or she discovers. The question every individual \nmust face is, do you like and accept who you are? Once \nthat question is answered, then self-respect is gained. Once \nan individual establishes that respect for his or herself, no one can take that away. In this context, Abraham Maslow is \njustified in establishing self-actualization in a category by \nitself that quantifies the need of being  separately from the \nneed of deficit . \nT\nH E  C O N T R O V E R S Y \nAs we take a look at Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy pyramid, there is some controversy as to how it relates directly to humanistic psychology. Is there enough evidence to sup-\nport this hierarchy when it comes right down to how people \ndevelop emotionally? Maslow set forth \nwith the notion that these stages along \nthe course of development match up \nwith how people experience psycho-\nlogical growth. \nThe primary contention is that \nanyone in society can regress back to, or value an alternative aspect of the \nhierarchy pyramid in a way that is \nnot parallel with Maslow\u2019s model. For \nexample, some cultures may be more fixated on belong-\ning over safety, or esteem over belonging.\n5 To answer these \nchallenges, many experts believe that Abraham Maslow\u2019s \nhierarchy doesn\u2019t always follow in sequence with how it \nwas intended. If the notion of self-esteem, for example, is \nthought to develop in children as early as two years of age, \nthen why does Maslow address esteem needs so high up in the hierarchy pyramid? Humanistic psychology does chal-\nlenge some of these notions, even though Maslow was a \nbeliever in humanistic psychology.\nAnother oft-challenged aspect of his work is that Maslow \nhimself defined self-actualizers as people of great accom-plishment, such as former presidents, dignitaries and great \ndiscoverers.

How does this impact human behavior? Looking back at the very basics of physiological needs for example, people need to feel good. It does not matter if a person is employed as a janitor or a top-notch cardiac sur-geon, if he or she is diagnosed with a disease that impacts them physically, he or she is likely to regress back towards satisfying any physiological needs that may come about. The affected individual\u2019s attitude towards the prognosis of this disease will likely contribute towards a shift in his or her priorities. Emotionally, the feelings of love and belonging may be impacted in the sense that they may want to ensure that their loved ones are safe when they pass.\nWith regard to esteem, for some, there may be a great \nsense of loss, while others may come to terms with the fact. With that being said, there are circumstances that affect each individual with regard to where he or she stands in the hierarchy pyramid.\nIs everyone a self-actualizer? Yes. For each individual, \nthis experience is different. It is experienced at differ-ent depths depending on individual life experiences. The more in touch one is with one\u2019s inner self, the better he or she can control, and often master, one\u2019s self-talk. It is also important to remember that all individuals are constantly impacted by the forces of life, some of which are far beyond personal control. When the opportunity arises to experi-ence this hierarchy, and the needs of deficit are fully met, it allows the individual to make a closer connection with the concept of self-actualization. Also, when these deficit needs are met, self-actualization, in a sense, is likely to become even more enhanced.\nThe bottom line is that everyone is effected emotion-\nally at every level of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs. If early life experiences as a child are positive, and needs are being met, that individual will excel in the area of self-confidence and self-esteem at much faster rate. It helps to establish a strong foundation for life. Later, the individual is able to establish a much stronger set of coping mechanisms when one of the deficit needs isn\u2019t being met. Additionally, when adverse circumstances confront the individual, he or she is often better-equipped with the ability to problem solve and confront the challenge confidently.\nConversely, if early life experiences as a child are nega-\ntive, and needs are not met, that individual\u2019s foundation isn\u2019t as secure, and he or she is not as likely to excel in self-confidence and self-esteem, rather, he or she is likely to get trapped a state of constantly seeking approval from peers. He or she may develop a fear of making mistakes.\nThe majority falls somewhere in between what is posi-\ntive in life and what is negative. Ultimately, individuals who develop a strong, well-established foundation are likely to be emotionally strong and can exercise a stronger sense of self control. Those whose foundation is shaky and not very stable will focus more on protecting it, therefore having less confidence in that foundation.\nAB O U T  T H E  A U T H O R\nR\nobert A Poston, cst has been a \nsurgical technologist since 1993.
