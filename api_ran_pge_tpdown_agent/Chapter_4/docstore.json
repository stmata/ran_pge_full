The \n Caterpillar name, however, dates back to the early 1900s when Benjamin Holt, one of the  company\u2019s \n founders, designed a tractor crawler with wide, thick tracks instead of wheels. These tracks \n prevented the machine from sinking into California\u2019s deep, rich soil, which was impassable when \nwet. The new farm tractor crept along the farmland in such a way that one observer said it \u201ccrawled \nlike a  caterpillar. \u201d Holt sold the tractor under the Caterpillar brand, and after the merger, the newly \nformed company became Caterpillar Tractor Company. The company grew steadily at first, hitting a Business markets, although often less visible than consumer markets, are substantially larger than \nconsumer markets.

Since then, Caterpillar Inc., or CAT, has grown into the largest manufacturer of earth-  moving \nequipment and engines in the world. Today, Caterpillar ranks number one or number two in every \nindustry it serves. Its products have a reputation for high quality and reliability, and the  company has \nmaintained a strong focus on innovation while expanding its product portfolio. Its  distinctive yellow \nmachines are found all over the globe and have helped make the brand a U.S. icon.1\nSome of the world\u2019s most valuable brands belong to business marketers: ABB, Caterpillar, DuPont, \nFedEx, HP, IBM, Intel, and Siemens, to name a few. Many principles of basic marketing also apply to \nbusiness marketers. They need to embrace holistic marketing principles, such as building strong loyalty \nrelationships with their customers, just like consumer marketers. But they also face some unique chal -\nlenges in selling to other businesses. In this chapter, we will highlight some of the crucial similarities \nand differences for marketing in business markets.2\nThe Organizational Buying Process\nOrganizational buying is the decision-making process by which formal organizations establish the \nneed for purchased products and services and by which they identify, evaluate, and choose among \nalternative brands and suppliers.3\nUNDERSTANDING BUSINESS MARKETS\nBusiness markets  consist of all the organizations that acquire goods and services used in the pro -\nduction of products or services that are sold, rented, or supplied to others. Any firm that supplies \ncomponents for products is in the business-to-business (B2B) marketplace. Some of the major \n industries making up the business market are aerospace; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; chemi -\ncal;  computer; construction; defense; energy; mining; manufacturing; construction; transportation; \ncommunication; public utilities; banking, finance, and insurance; distribution; and services.\nMore dollars and items change hands in sales to business buyers than to consumers. Consider the \nprocess of producing and selling a simple pair of shoes.4 A broad spectrum of materials and material \ncombinations are used today in shoe manufacturing. Leathers, synthetics, rubber, and textile materials \nare counted among the basic upper materials. Each material has its own specific character, which differs \nnot only in appearance but also in physical properties, service life, and treatment needs. The choice \nof shoe material significantly influences the life of the footwear and in many cases dictates its use. For \nleather shoes, hide dealers must sell hides to tanners, who sell leather to shoe manufacturers, who sell \nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b187299-ad67-4621-965d-4a3d0eccd1cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b187299-ad67-4621-965d-4a3d0eccd1cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e0c0d3a7-52c7-48af-b5f3-d6ac60f4ba1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "905329eefa3a6e339f94d90bff4caacb11cb656b981b65824095b6784f3fe32b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40240629-c55f-4530-8c9e-f9ae3a4b73fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "7f6772dba4fa2b2acb5af66ce76f09ba06293a5b6000a2a3ef0ffa6125c0b750", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "675240f5-4ffe-4f73-bea3-31a185adf54d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52a820e88541272bf5ddb48f1ec76e454dc375486354d5379a5943dfb4cb667f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "80 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nshoes to wholesalers, who sell shoes to retailers, who finally sell them to consumers. Each party in the \nsupply chain also buys many other goods and services to support its operations.\nGiven the highly competitive nature of business-to-business markets, the biggest enemy to mar -\nketers here is commoditization, whereby customers perceive products from different companies as \noffering identical benefits.5 Commoditization eats away margins and weakens customer loyalty. It \ncan be overcome only if target customers are convinced that meaningful differences exist among the \nproducts in the marketplace and that the unique benefits of the firm\u2019s offerings are worth the additional \ncost. Thus, a critical step in business-to-business marketing is to create and communicate relevant \ndifferentiation from competitors.\nBusiness marketers face many of the same challenges as consumer marketers, especially when it \ncomes to understanding their customers and what they value. The well-respected Institute for the Study \nof Business Markets (ISBM) notes that the three biggest hurdles for B2B marketing involve integrating \nsales and marketing departments, managing innovation, and gathering and utilizing customer and \nmarket insights. Four additional imperatives cited by ISBM are demonstrating marketing\u2019s contribution \nto business performance, engaging more deeply with customers and customers\u2019 customers, identify -\ning the right mix of centralized versus decentralized marketing activities, and finding and grooming \nmarketing talent and competencies.6\nBusiness markets contrast sharply with consumer markets in some ways, however.

The business marketer normally deals with far fewer and buyers of much \nlarger quantities than the consumer marketer does, particularly in such industries as aircraft \nengines and defense weapons. The fortunes of Goodyear tires, Cummins engines, Delphi control \nsystems, and other automotive part suppliers depend in large part on getting big contracts from \njust a handful of major automakers.\n\u2022 Close supplier\u2013customer relationships . Because of the smaller customer base and the size, impor -\ntance, and power of the customers, suppliers are frequently expected to customize their offerings \nfor individual business customer needs. On an annual basis, Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries pur -\nchases more than $7 billion in materials and services from thousands of suppliers. PPG rewards its \nsuppliers for superior performance on attributes such as product quality, delivery, documentation, \ninnovation, responsiveness, and continuous improvement. With the Supplier Added Value Effort \n($AVE) program, PPG challenges its suppliers of maintenance, repair, and operating goods and \nservices to deliver on annual value-added and cost-savings proposals equaling at least 5 percent \nof their total annual sales to PPG.7 Business buyers also often select suppliers that also buy from \nthem. A paper manufacturer might buy chemicals for its pulp and paper making from a chemical \ncompany that in turn buys a considerable amount of paper from the manufacturer.\n\u2022 Professional purchasing . Business goods are often purchased by trained purchasing agents, who \nmust follow their organizations\u2019 purchasing policies, constraints, and requirements. Much of \nthe documentation used in business buying\u2014for example, requests for quotations, proposals, \nand purchase contracts\u2014are not typically found in consumer buying. Many professional buyers \nbelong to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which seeks to improve the profession\u2019s \neffectiveness and status. This means business marketers must provide more technical data about \ntheir product and its competitive advantages.\n\u2022 Multiple buying influences . More people typically influence business-buying decisions. Buying \ncommittees that include technical experts and even senior management are common in the pur -\nchase of major goods. Business marketers need to send well-trained sales representatives and \nteams to deal with these equally well-trained buyers.\n\u2022 Derived demand . The demand for business goods is ultimately derived from the demand for con -\nsumer goods. For this reason, the business marketer must closely monitor the buying patterns \nof end users. Pittsburgh-based Consol Energy\u2019s coal and natural gas business largely depends \non orders from utilities and steel companies, which, in turn, depend on consumer demand for \nelectricity and for steel-based products such as automobiles, machines, and appliances. Business \nbuyers must also pay close attention to economic factors like the level of production, investment, \nand consumer spending, as well as to the interest rate. Business marketers can do little to stimulate \ntotal demand. They can only fight harder to increase or maintain their share.\n\u2022 Inelastic demand . The total demand for many business goods and services is inelastic\u2014that is, \nit is not much affected by price changes. Shoe manufacturers are not going to buy much more \nleather if the price of leather falls or much less if the price rises (unless they find satisfactory sub -\nstitutes).

Demand is also inelastic for business goods that represent a small \npercentage of the item\u2019s total cost, such as shoelaces.\n\u2022 Fluctuating demand . The demand for business goods and services tends to be more volatile than \nthe demand for consumer goods and services. A given percentage increase in consumer demand \ncan lead to a much larger percentage increase in the demand for plant and equipment. Demand \nfor plant and equipment is more volatile because it reflects the normal year-to-year replacement \ndemand as well as the need to satisfy increased or decreased consumer demand.\n\u2022 Geographically concentrated buyers . For years, more than half of U.S. business buyers have been \nconcentrated in seven states: New York, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, and \nMichigan. The geographic concentration of producers often helps to reduce costs. At the same \ntime, business marketers need to monitor regional shifts of certain industries, such as the auto -\nmobile industry, which is no longer concentrated around Detroit.\n\u2022 Direct purchasing . Business buyers often buy directly from manufacturers rather than through \nintermediaries, especially items that are technically complex or expensive, such as agricultural \nequipment, industrial machinery, and aircraft.\nTYPES OF BUYING DECISIONS\nThe business buyer faces many decisions in making a purchase. How many depends on the com -\nplexity of the problem being solved, the newness of the buying requirement, the number of people \ninvolved, and the time required to complete the purchase. There are three types of business-buying \nsituations: the straight rebuy, the modified rebuy, and the new buy.8\n\u2022 Straight rebuy . In a straight rebuy, the purchasing department reorders items like office sup -\nplies and bulk chemicals on a routine basis and chooses from suppliers on an approved list. The \nsuppliers make an effort to maintain product and service quality and often propose automatic \nreordering systems to save time. Suppliers attempt to offer prospective customers something new \nor exploit dissatisfaction with a current supplier. Their goal is to get a small order and then enlarge \ntheir purchase share over time.\n\u2022 Modified rebuy . The buyer in a modified rebuy wants to change product specifications, prices, \ndelivery requirements, or other terms. This usually requires additional negotiation and can lead \nto a new purchase agreement or, in some cases, to a disruption of the business relationship and \na change in suppliers.\n\u2022 New buy . A new-buy purchaser faces some risk when acquiring a product or service for the first \ntime (e.g., an office building, a new security system). The greater the risk or cost, the larger the \nnumber of buying-decision participants, the greater their information gathering\u2014and the longer \nthe time it takes to make a decision.9\nThe business buyer makes the fewest decisions in the straight-rebuy situation and the most in \nthe new-buy situation. Over time, new-buy situations become straight rebuys and routine purchase \nbehavior.\nNew-buy purchasing is the marketer\u2019s greatest opportunity and challenge. The buying process \npasses through several stages: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. Mass media can be \nmost important during the initial awareness stage, salespeople often have their greatest impact at the \ninterest stage, and technical sources can be most important during evaluation. Online selling efforts \nmay be useful at all stages.\nIn the new-buy situation, the buyer must determine product specifications, price limits, delivery \nterms and times, service terms, payment terms, order quantities, acceptable suppliers, and the selected \nsupplier. Different participants influence each decision, and the order in which these decisions are \nmade varies.\nBecause of the complicated selling required, many companies use sales force consisting of their \nmost effective salespeople. The brand promise and the manufacturer\u2019s name recognition will be impor -\ntant in establishing trust and persuading the customer to consider change. The marketer also tries to \nreach as many key participants as possible with information and assistance.\nOnce a customer has been acquired, a company\u2019s sales force continually seeks ways to add value to \nits market offer to facilitate rebuys. EMC (now Dell EMC) has successfully acquired a series of computer \nsoftware leaders to reposition the company to manage and protect\u2014not just store\u2014information, thus \nhelping companies \u201caccelerate their journey to cloud computing.\u201d One hardware product once made \nup 80 percent of its sales, but Dell now gets the majority of its revenue from software and services.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4759, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "562e72b9-2921-4441-a61f-beb325082919": {"__data__": {"id_": "562e72b9-2921-4441-a61f-beb325082919", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92b10908-aea9-4c23-8628-dfd421e6ddb3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "fc9b1c74a24ebf75dfc9868dfbb80a15fb5d6bc4d84041d1745b884e74293a44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "675240f5-4ffe-4f73-bea3-31a185adf54d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "c76b59bc4b23b71ebfaf1ba10c506b147c058f274513b1cac7ef8fbebb5b11c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13250102-0ef8-4c04-a168-f3749a655cad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac92d1b73ed18b523f63a03256e993ef659fc8f1be214b3ee29955995d4f63cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "82 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nThe Buying Center\nWho buys the trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods and services needed by business organizations? \nPurchasing agents are influential in straight-rebuy and modified-rebuy situations, whereas other \nemployees are more influential in new-buy situations. Engineers are usually influential in selecting \nproduct components, and purchasing agents dominate in selecting suppliers.10\nTHE COMPOSITION OF THE BUYING CENTER\nThe decision-making unit of a buying organization is often referred to as the buying center.  It consists \nof \u201call those individuals and groups who participate in the purchasing decision-making process, who \nshare some common goals and the risks arising from the decisions.\u201d11 The buying center includes \nall members of the organization who play one or more of seven roles in the purchase decision process.\n\u2022 Initiators \u2014Users or others in the organization who request that something be purchased.\n\u2022 Users \u2014Those who will use the product or service. In many cases, the users initiate the buying \nproposal and help define the product requirements.\n\u2022 Influencers \u2014People who influence the buying decision, often by helping to define specifications \nand providing information for evaluating alternatives. Technical people are particularly important \ninfluencers.\n\u2022 Deciders \u2014People who decide on product requirements or on suppliers.\n\u2022 Approvers \u2014People who authorize the proposed actions of deciders or buyers.\n\u2022 Buyers \u2014People who have formal authority to select the supplier and arrange the purchase terms. \nBuyers may help shape product specifications, but their major role is to select vendors and nego -\ntiate terms and price. In more complex purchases, buyers might include high-level managers.\n\u2022 Gatekeepers \u2014People who have the power to prevent sellers or information from reaching members \nof the buying center. For example, purchasing agents, receptionists, and telephone operators may \nprevent salespersons from contacting users or deciders.\nSeveral people can occupy a given role such as user or influencer, and one person may play mul -\ntiple roles.12 A purchasing manager, for example, is often buyer, influencer, and gatekeeper simulta -\nneously. She can decide which sales reps can call on other people in the organization, what budget \nand other constraints to place on the purchase, and which firm will actually get the business, even \nthough others (deciders) might select two or more potential vendors that can meet the company\u2019s \nrequirements.\nA buying center typically has five or six members and sometimes dozens. Some may be outside \nthe organization, such as government officials, consultants, technical advisors, and members of the \nmarketing channel.\nTHE ROLE OF THE BUYING CENTER \nIN\u00a0THE\u00a0ORGANIZATION\nIn the past, purchasing departments occupied a humble position in the management hierarchy, in \nspite of often managing more than half of the company\u2019s costs. Recent competitive pressures have \nled many companies to upgrade their purchasing departments and elevate administrators to vice-\npresidential rank. These new, more strategically oriented purchasing departments have a mission to \nseek the best value from fewer and better suppliers.\nSome multinationals have even elevated purchasing departments to \u201cstrategic supply depart -\nments\u201d with responsibility for global sourcing and partnering. At Caterpillar, purchasing, inventory \ncontrol, production scheduling, and traffic have been combined into one department. Here are two \nother companies that have benefited from improving their business-buying practices:\nRio Tinto  Rio Tinto is a world leader in finding, mining, and processing the earth\u2019s mineral \nresources, with a significant presence in North America and Australia. Coordinating with its \nsuppliers was time consuming, so Rio Tinto embarked on an electronic commerce strategy with \none key supplier. Both parties have reaped significant benefits. In many cases, orders are filled \nin the supplier\u2019s warehouse within minutes of being transmitted, and the supplier can now use a \npay-on-receipt program that has shortened Rio Tinto\u2019s payment cycle to about 10 days.13", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4181, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13250102-0ef8-4c04-a168-f3749a655cad": {"__data__": {"id_": "13250102-0ef8-4c04-a168-f3749a655cad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4328dcb0-70e5-47de-b2b4-ac4919df00b6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "20e3600ec853c8c5cd840fa3bce17a9bd014a861df1d6bd2a024389830d87478", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "562e72b9-2921-4441-a61f-beb325082919", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "fc9b1c74a24ebf75dfc9868dfbb80a15fb5d6bc4d84041d1745b884e74293a44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0acac55a-6489-44eb-93a5-3fe663141727", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "644b17685ddaa080579700f7f1349e8483d0e6ebdab44508f2b2d179b16e65ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 4    |  ANAlyzING BUSINESS  MARKETS  83\nThe upgrading of purchasing departments means business marketers must upgrade their sales \nstaff to match the higher caliber of today\u2019s business buyers.\nBUYING CENTER DYNAMICS\nBuying centers usually include participants with differing interests, authority, status, and suscep -\ntibility to persuasion, and sometimes with very different decision criteria. Engineers may want to \nmaximize the performance of the product, production people may stress ease of use and reliability \nof supply, financial staff will focus on the economics of the purchase, purchasing may be concerned \nwith operating and replacement costs, and union officials may emphasize safety issues.\nBusiness buyers also have personal motivations, perceptions, and preferences influenced by \ntheir age, income, education, job position, personality, attitude toward risk, and culture. Some are \n\u201ckeep-it-simple\u201d buyers, or \u201cown-expert,\u201d \u201cwant-the-best,\u201d or \u201cwant-everything-done\u201d buyers. Some \nyounger, highly educated buyers are technically proficient and conduct rigorous analyses of com -\npetitive proposals before choosing a supplier. Other buyers are \u201ctoughies\u201d from the old school who \npit competing sellers against one another. And in some companies, the purchasing powers-that-be \nare legendary.\nPurchasing decisions are ultimately made by individuals, not organizations.15 Individuals are \nmotivated by their own needs and perceptions in attempting to maximize the organizational rewards \nthey earn (pay, advancement, recognition, and feelings of achievement). However, organizational needs \nlegitimize the buying process and its outcomes.\nBusinesspeople are not buying just \u201cproducts.\u201d They are buying solutions to two problems: the \norganization\u2019s economic and strategic problem and their own personal need for achievement and \nreward. In this sense, industrial buying decisions are both \u201crational\u201d and \u201cemotional,\u201d serving the needs \nof the organization as well as those of the individual.16\nResearch by one manufacturer of industrial components found that even though top execu -\ntives at its small- and medium-size customers were comfortable buying from other companies, they \nappeared to harbor subconscious insecurities about buying the manufacturer\u2019s product. Constant \nchanges in technology had left them concerned about issues such as product performance, reliabil -\nity, and compatibility. Recognizing this unease, the manufacturer retooled its selling approach to \nemphasize a more emotional appeal and the way its product line enabled the customer\u2019s employees \nto improve their performance, relieving management of the perceived complications and stress of \nusing its components.17\nSELLING TO BUYING CENTERS\nSuccessful business-to-business marketing requires that marketers determine not only the types of \ncompanies on which to focus their selling efforts but also whom to concentrate on within the buying \ncenters in those organizations.\nOnce marketers identify the type of businesses on which to focus marketing efforts, they must \nthen decide how best to sell to these businesses. Who are the major decision participants? What deci -\nsions do they influence, and how deeply? What evaluation criteria do they use? Consider the following \nexample:\nA company sells nonwoven disposable surgical gowns to hospitals. The hospital staff who \nparticipate in the buying decision include the vice president of purchasing, the operating-\nroom administrator, and the surgeons. The vice president of purchasing analyzes whether \nthe hospital should buy disposable or reusable gowns. If disposable, the operating-room \nadministrator compares various competitors\u2019 products on absorbency, antiseptic quality, \ndesign, and cost and normally buys the brand that meets functional requirements at the \nlowest cost. Surgeons influence the decision retroactively by reporting their satisfaction with \nthe chosen brand.Medline Industries  Medline Industries, the largest privately owned manufacturer and \ndistributor of health care products in the United States, used software to integrate its view of \ncustomer activity across online and direct sales channels. The results? The firm enhanced \nits product margin, improved customer retention, reduced revenue lost to pricing errors, and \nincreased the productivity of its sales representatives.14", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4362, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0acac55a-6489-44eb-93a5-3fe663141727": {"__data__": {"id_": "0acac55a-6489-44eb-93a5-3fe663141727", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04db412b-56df-4d83-b330-be2a564c18b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "220881ba733eb10ff2372bb81eb52d411df92660fa4151a1db7ab8ca16421ceb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13250102-0ef8-4c04-a168-f3749a655cad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "233c54445b0321080d02353cbdd438dfc93c7949d3ecdbc3399e62cf3e1dbece", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5cb51c19-acf2-4342-ae0f-41a56df5d4f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f3f5feb2e1b2d09c1ae36fe2819b93ee3282e1ee6a599323ab958d796cec7a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "84 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nThe business marketer is not likely to know exactly what kind of group dynamics take place dur -\ning the decision process, though whatever information he or she can obtain about personalities and \ninterpersonal factors is useful.\nSmall sellers concentrate on reaching the key buying influencers. Larger sellers often go for \n in-depth selling to reach as many participants as possible. Their salespeople virtually \u201clive with\u201d high-\nvolume customers. Companies must rely more heavily on their communications programs to reach \nhidden buying influencers and keep current customers informed.18\nBusiness marketers must periodically review their assumptions about buying center participants. \nTraditionally, SAP sold its software products to CIOs at large companies. A shift in selling focus from \nCIOs to individual corporate units lower on the organizational chart significantly raised the volume \nof software license sales to new SAP customers.\nInsights into customers and buying centers are critical. GE\u2019s ethnographic research into the plastic-\nfiber industry revealed that the firm wasn\u2019t in a commodity business driven by price, as it had assumed. \nInstead, it was in an artisanal industry whose customers wanted collaboration at the earliest stages of \ndevelopment. This resulted in GE completely reorienting the way it interacted with companies in the \nindustry. Ethnographic research also can be very useful in developing markets, especially in far-flung \nrural areas where marketers often do not know the consumers well.\nIn developing selling efforts, business marketers can also consider their customers\u2019 customers, or \nend users, if appropriate. Many B2B sales are to firms that use the products they purchase as compo -\nnents in products they sell to the ultimate consumers. Business marketers can seek out opportunities \nto interact with their customers\u2019 customers and improve their offerings or even their business model. \nWhen Xsens, a Dutch supplier of three-dimensional motion-sensor technology, helped solve the prob -\nlems of one of its customers\u2019 customers, it also developed a new operating procedure that improved the \naccuracy of its products by an order of magnitude.19\nUnderstanding the Buying Process\nThe business-buying process encompasses a number of explicit stages. One popular model delin -\neates eight distinct stages of the decision process in business markets.20 These stages are shown in \nFigure\u00a0 4.1, and the important considerations in each of the eight stages are discussed in more detail \nin the following sections. Note that in modified-rebuy or straight-rebuy situations, some stages are \ncompressed or bypassed. For example, the buyer normally has a favorite supplier or a ranked list of \nsuppliers and can skip the search and the proposal solicitation.\nPROBLEM RECOGNITION\nThe buying process begins when someone in the company recognizes a problem or need that can be \nmet by acquiring a good or service. The recognition can be triggered by internal or external stimuli. \nThe internal stimulus might be a decision to develop a new product that requires new equipment and \nmaterials, or it might be a machine that breaks down and requires new parts. Or purchased material \nmay turn out to be unsatisfactory and cause the company to search for another supplier, lower prices, \nor better quality. Externally, the buyer may get new ideas at a trade show, see an ad, receive an e-mail, \nread a blog, or take a call from a sales representative who offers a better product or a lower price. \nBusiness marketers can stimulate problem recognition by direct marketing in many different ways.\nNEED DESCRIPTION\nNext, the buyer determines the needed item\u2019s general characteristics and the required quantity. The \ngoal here is to identify the specific need(s) that the company aims to fulfill and the benefits it seeks \nto receive from the offering. For standard items, this is simple.

On the downside, online business buying may tend to erode supplier\u2013\nbuyer loyalty and create potential security problems.\nPROPOSAL SOLICITATION\nThe buyer next invites qualified suppliers to submit written proposals. After evaluating these propos -\nals, the buyer will invite a few suppliers to make formal presentations.\nBusiness marketers must be skilled in researching, writing, and presenting marketing propos -\nals that describe value and benefits in customer terms. In addition, oral presentations must inspire \nconfidence and must position the company\u2019s capabilities and resources so they stand out from the \ncompetition.\nProposals and selling efforts are often team efforts that leverage the knowledge and expertise of \ncoworkers. Pittsburgh-based Cutler-Hammer, part of Eaton Corp., developed \u201cpods\u201d of salespeople \nfocused on a particular geographic region, industry, or market concentration.\nSUPPLIER SELECTION\nBusiness buyers seek the highest benefit package (economic, technical, service, and social) in rela -\ntionship to a market offering\u2019s costs. The strength of their incentive to purchase is a function of the \ndifference between perceived benefits and perceived costs.23 The attributes that buyers commonly \nuse to evaluate vendors include price, reputation, reliability, and agility. Before selecting a supplier, \nthe buying center will specify and rank desired supplier attributes, often using a supplier-evaluation \nmodel to rate suppliers based on their performance on the attributes valued by the buyer.\nBusiness marketers must therefore ensure that customers fully appreciate how the firm\u2019s offer -\nings are different and better. To this end, sellers often present or \u201cframe\u201d their offerings in a way that \nenables them to underscore the benefits they provide. It can be as simple as making sure customers \nrecognize all the benefits or cost savings afforded by the firm\u2019s offerings or becoming more influen -\ntial in the customers\u2019 thinking about the economics of purchasing, owning, using, and disposing of \nproduct offerings.\nTo develop compelling value propositions, business marketers need to better understand how \nbusiness buyers arrive at their valuations.24 The choice of attributes and their relative importance vary \nwith the buying situation. Delivery reliability, price, and supplier reputation might be important for \nsome companies. For others, the most important attributes might be technical service, supplier flex -\nibility, and product reliability. Clearly identifying a company\u2019s priorities when choosing a supplier and \nidentifying suppliers that meet these criteria are key to market success.\nCompanies are increasingly reducing the number of their suppliers. There is even a trend toward \nsingle sourcing, though companies that use multiple sources often cite the threat of a labor strike, \nnatural disaster, or any other unforeseen event as the biggest deterrent to single sourcing. Companies \nmay also fear that single-source suppliers will become too comfortable in the relationship and lose \ntheir competitive edge.\nCONTRACT NEGOTIATION\nAfter selecting suppliers, the buyer negotiates the final order, which includes listing the technical \nspecifications, the quantity needed, the expected time of delivery, return policies, and warranties. \nMany industrial buyers lease rather than buy heavy equipment such as machinery and trucks. The \nlessee gains a number of advantages: the latest products, better service, conservation of capital, and \nsome tax advantages. The lessor often ends up with a larger net income and the chance to serve cus -\ntomers that could not afford outright purchase.\nFor maintenance, repair, and operating items, buyers are moving toward blanket contracts rather \nthan periodic purchase orders. A blanket contract establishes a long-term relationship in which the \nsupplier promises to resupply the buyer as needed, at agreed-upon prices, over a specified period of \ntime. Because the seller holds the stock, blanket contracts are sometimes called stockless purchase plans.  \nThey lock suppliers in tighter with the buyer and make it difficult for out-suppliers to break in unless \nthe buyer becomes dissatisfied.\nCompanies that fear a shortage of key materials are willing to buy and hold large inventories. They \nwill sign long-term contracts with suppliers to ensure a steady flow of materials.

For example, General Motors wants to buy from fewer suppliers, which must \nbe willing to locate close to its plants and produce high-quality components. Business marketers are \nalso setting up extranets with important customers to facilitate and lower the cost of transactions. \nCustomers enter orders that are automatically transmitted to the supplier.\nSome companies go further and shift the ordering responsibility to their suppliers, using sys -\ntems called vendor-managed inventory. These suppliers are privy to the customer\u2019s inventory levels \nand take responsibility for continuous replenishment programs. Performance Pipe, a division of \nChevron Phillips Chemical Company, supplies audio, lighting, and vision systems to the world\u2019s \nleading automakers. Its vendor-managed inventory program, with its 40 suppliers, resulted in signifi -\ncant time and cost savings and allowed the company to use former warehouse space for productive \nmanufacturing activities.25\nPERFORMANCE REVIEW\nThe buyer periodically reviews the performance of the chosen supplier(s) using one of three methods. \nThe buyer may contact end users and ask for their evaluations, rate the supplier on several criteria \nusing a weighted-score method, or aggregate the cost of poor performance to come up with adjusted \ncosts of purchase, including price. The performance review may lead the buyer to continue, modify, \nor end a supplier relationship.\nMany companies have set up incentive systems to reward purchasing managers for good buying \nperformance, leading them to increase pressure on sellers for the best terms.\nDeveloping Effective Business Marketing \nPrograms\nBusiness-to-business marketers are using every marketing tool at their disposal to attract and retain \ncustomers. They are embracing systems selling, adding valuable services to their product offerings, \nemploying customer reference programs, and utilizing a wide variety of online and offline commu -\nnication and branding activities.\nTRANSITIONING FROM PRODUCTS TO SOLUTIONS\nMany business buyers prefer to buy a total problem solution from one seller. This practice of systems \nbuying  originated with government purchases of major weapons and communications systems. The \ngovernment solicited bids from prime contractors that, if awarded the contract, became responsible \nfor bidding out and assembling the system\u2019s subcomponents from second-tier contractors. The prime \ncontractor thus provided a turnkey solution, so called because the buyer simply had to turn one key \nto get the job done.26\nSellers increasingly recognize that buyers like to purchase in this way, and many have adopted \nsystems selling  as a marketing tool. Technology giants such as HP, IBM, Oracle, and Dell are all tran -\nsitioning from specialists to competing one-stop shops that can provide the core technology necessary \nas businesses shift to the cloud.\nOne variant of systems selling is systems contracting, in which a single supplier provides the \nbuyer with all its maintenance, repair, and operating MRO requirements. During the contract period, \nthe supplier also manages the customer\u2019s inventory. Shell Oil manages the oil inventories of many \nof its business customers and knows when they require replenishment. The customer benefits from \nreduced procurement and management costs, as well as from price protection over the term of the \ncontract. The seller achieves lower operating costs thanks to steady demand and reduced paperwork.\nSystems selling is a key industrial marketing strategy in bidding for large-scale industrial projects \nsuch as the construction of dams, steel factories, irrigation systems, sanitation systems, pipelines, utili -\nties, and even new towns. Project engineering firms must compete on price, quality, reliability, and \nother attributes to win contracts. Suppliers, however, are not just at the mercy of customer demands. \nIdeally, they\u2019re active early in the process to influence the actual development of the specifications. \nOr they can go beyond the specifications to offer additional value in various ways, as the following \nexample shows.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4277, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "479a3cd6-da51-48de-a7ca-53bd55c58d5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "479a3cd6-da51-48de-a7ca-53bd55c58d5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2718ef5c-e17b-4152-9d56-e3a3338375b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "1abd89c3d5d9724909b65a4c9e29e49d078ab2578ab46b2ec27cd504d88497b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "078576c7-adc6-4daa-ab6f-eae02449f552", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "6d53a7a34cd2c80d03fd3fc16f7a836e64bcd21b9708c77ed056b215b1373ace", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "058e13ca-23cc-48ba-8690-b5b40e655774", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a4899af9bd8dcccc1eb9ad832e0c2748eb065ffc9149bbb6da60124f639c43d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "88 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nSelling to the Indonesian Government  The Indonesian government requested \nbids to build a cement factory near Jakarta. A U.S. firm made a proposal that included choosing \nthe site, designing the factory, hiring the construction crews, assembling the materials and \nequipment, and turning over the finished factory to the Indonesian government. A Japanese \nfirm, in its proposal, included all these services, plus hiring and training the workers to run the \nfactory, exporting the cement through its trading companies, and using the cement to build \nroads and new office buildings in Jakarta. Although the Japanese plan involved more money, \nit won the contract. Clearly, the Japanese viewed the problem not just as building a cement \nfactory (the narrow view of systems selling) but as contributing to Indonesia\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. They took the broadest possible view of the customer\u2019s needs, which is true \nsystems selling.\nENHANCING SERVICES\nServices play an increasing strategic and financial role for many business-to-business firms that sell \nprimarily products. Adding high-quality services to their product offerings allows companies to pro -\nvide greater value and establish closer ties with customers.\nA classic example is Rolls-Royce, which has invested heavily in developing giant jet engine models \nfor the new jumbo planes being introduced by Boeing and Airbus. An important source of profits for \nRolls-Royce, beyond selling engines and replacement parts, is the add-on \u201cpower by the hour\u201d long-\nterm repair and maintenance contracts it sells. Margins are higher because customers are willing to \npay a premium for the peace of mind and predictability the contracts offer.27\nTechnology firms are also bundling services to improve customer satisfaction and increase profits. \nLike many software firms, Adobe Systems is making the transition to a digital-marketing business \nwith cloud-based monthly subscriptions. For example, Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustra -\ntor, and InDesign have moved online to become subscription-based services. A particular benefit for \ncompanies offering such services is that the subscription model eliminates the need to constantly try \nto convince users who have purchased the product in the past to upgrade to the new version; in the \nsubscription model it happens automatically. Revenue is also increasing because the company is able \nto sell support services to its cloud customers.\nBUILDING BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS BRANDS\nBusiness marketers are increasingly recognizing the importance of their brands. Brands give managers \npeace of mind by ensuring product quality and thus make it easier to justify the purchase of established \nbrands to the company stakeholders. As the old saying goes: \u201cNobody gets fired for  buying\u00a0IBM.\u201d\nSwiss-based ABB is a global leader in power and automation technologies, with 110,000 employees \nin more than 100 countries. The company spends $1 billion in R&D annually to fuel a long tradition \nof groundbreaking and nation-building projects. ABB undertook an extensive rebranding project that \nevaluated five alternative positioning platforms, concluding that ABB should stand for \u201cPower and \nProductivity for a Better World.\u201d In a \u201cone company, one brand\u201d approach, magazines, posters, bro -\nchures, digital communication, and even exhibits were all revamped to give the brand a unified look \nand strengthen its global market position. Most of ABB business advertising contains images of actual \nprojects, with business-specific messages that explain technologies.28\nIn business-to-business marketing, the corporate brand is often critical because it is associ -\nated with so many of the company\u2019s products. At one time Emerson Electric\u2014a global provider of \npower tools, compressors, electrical equipment, and engineering solutions\u2014was a conglomerate of \n60 autonomous, and sometimes anonymous, companies. To achieve a broader presence so it could \nsell locally while leveraging its global brand name, Emerson aligned the brands under a new global \nbrand architecture and identity. Global consolidation cut the number of company websites in half, \nonline content and marketing campaigns were translated into local languages around the globe, and \nsocial media platforms were built out.29 SAS is another firm that recognized the importance of its \ncorporate brand.\nSAS With a huge \u201cfan club\u201d of IT customers in 147 countries, business analytics software and \nservices firm SAS seemed to be in an enviable position at the turn of the century. yet its image \nwas what one industry observer called \u201ca geek brand.\u201d To extend the company\u2019s reach beyond IT \nmanagers with PhDs in math or statistical analysis, the company needed to connect with C-level", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4779, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "058e13ca-23cc-48ba-8690-b5b40e655774": {"__data__": {"id_": "058e13ca-23cc-48ba-8690-b5b40e655774", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4502ecf9-ae43-4cdf-bfd8-cba3f33f8b54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "c3bc008bcdf9c2efc5ead718abcd34292489971a3320da54a5228a5d1972a054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "479a3cd6-da51-48de-a7ca-53bd55c58d5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "6840c64797e7e931694fcb1a9c9199e54669d238e5ec2ccfafa448c0a383fba0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a62afbb-a7f3-415e-8c40-1266e62ca412", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80b5b998640f05d393c671d2433102d25445138e31dd03f66e1ea0b53e84dff3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 4    |  ANAlyzING BUSINESS  MARKETS  89\n<< To shed its image \nas a brand solely for IT \nmanagers and achieve \nsolid growth, business \nanalytics software firm \nSAS geared a TV and \nprint ad campaign to \nexecutives who were \nunaware of the benefits \nof SAS software or the \nmerits of business ana-\nlytics in general.\nSource: Kristoffer Tripplaar/Alamy Stock Photo\nexecutives in the largest companies\u2014people who either didn\u2019t have a clue what SAS software \nwas or didn\u2019t think business analytics was a strategic issue.

The number of price-\noriented buyers can vary by country, depending on customer preferences for different service con -\nfigurations and the characteristics of the customer\u2019s organization.31\nMarketers can counter requests for a lower price in a number of ways, including the use of framing, \nas noted previously. They may also be able to show that the total cost of ownership\u2014that is, the life-cycle \ncost of using their product\u2014is lower than that for competitors\u2019 products. They can cite the value of the \nservices the buyer now receives, especially if it is superior to that offered by competitors.32 Research \nshows that service support and personal interactions, as well as a supplier\u2019s know-how and ability to \nimprove customers\u2019 time to market, can be useful differentiators in achieving key-supplier status.33\nImproving productivity helps alleviate price pressures. Some companies handle price-oriented \nbuyers by setting a lower price but establishing restrictive conditions such as limited quantities, no \nrefunds, no adjustments, and no services.34 Others seek solutions that increase benefits and reduce \ncosts enough to overcome any price concerns.

Suppose that Medline, a hospital sup -\nplier, signs an agreement with Highland Park Hospital promising $350,000 in savings over the first  \n18 months in exchange for getting a tenfold increase in the hospital\u2019s share of supplies. If Medline \nachieves less than this promised savings, it will make up the difference. If it achieves substantially more, \nit will participate in the extra savings. To make such arrangements work, the supplier must be willing to  \nhelp the customer build a historical database, reach an agreement for measuring benefits and costs, \nand devise a mechanism for resolving disputes.\nLowering the price and increasing benefits are not the only ways to overcome price pressures. \nIn some cases, the issue is not improving the offering but better communicating the benefits that the \noffering already delivers to customers. A popular approach to making the value of the offering more \ntransparent to customers is the economic value analysis . Economic value analysis (EVA) is a tool that helps \nmonetize the functional benefits of a company\u2019s offering, such as performance, reliability, and warranty.\nSuppose the buyer for a large construction company wants to buy a tractor for residential con -\nstruction from either Caterpillar or Komatsu. He wants the tractor to deliver certain levels of reliability, \ndurability, performance, and resale value. The competing salespeople carefully describe their respec -\ntive offers. The buyer decides Caterpillar has greater product benefits based on his perceptions of \nthose attributes. He also perceives differences in the accompanying services\u2014delivery, training, and \n maintenance\u2014and decides Caterpillar provides better service as well as a more knowledgeable and \nresponsive staff. Finally, he places higher value on Caterpillar\u2019s corporate image and reputation. He \nadds up all the economic, functional, and psychological benefits from these four sources\u2014product, \nservices, people, and image\u2014and decides he believes that Caterpillar delivers greater customer benefits.\nDoes he buy the Caterpillar tractor? Not necessarily. He also examines the total cost of transact -\ning with Caterpillar versus Komatsu, a cost that involves more than money. As Adam Smith observed \nmore than two centuries ago in The Wealth of Nations , \u201cThe real price of anything is the toil and trouble \nof acquiring it.\u201d Thus total customer cost also includes the buyer\u2019s time, energy, and psychological costs \nexpended in product acquisition, usage, maintenance, ownership, and disposal. The buyer evaluates \nthese elements, together with the monetary cost, to form a total customer cost. Then he considers \nwhether Caterpillar\u2019s total customer cost is too high compared to total customer benefits. If it is, he \nmight choose Komatsu. The buyer will choose whichever source delivers the highest perceived value.lincoln Electric welding wire for years, began to shop around for a better price, lincoln Electric \ndeveloped a package for working together to reduce costs.

First, it can increase total customer benefit by improving \nthe economic, functional, and psychological benefits of its product, services, people, and/or image. \nSecond, it can reduce the buyer\u2019s nonmonetary costs by reducing the time, energy, and psychological \ninvestment needed to acquire the product. Third, it can reduce its product\u2019s monetary cost to the buyer.\nSuppose Caterpillar concludes that the buyer sees its offer as worth $20,000. Further, suppose \nCaterpillar\u2019s cost of producing the tractor is $14,000. This means Caterpillar\u2019s offer generates $6,000 \nover its cost, so the firm needs to charge between $14,000 and $20,000. If it charges less than $14,000, \nit won\u2019t cover its costs; if it charges more, it will price itself out of the market.\nCaterpillar\u2019s price will determine how much value it delivers to the buyer and how much flows \nto Caterpillar. If the company charges $19,000, it is creating $1,000 of customer-perceived value and \nkeeping $5,000 for itself. The lower Caterpillar sets its price, the higher the customer\u2019s perceived value \nand, therefore, the higher the customer\u2019s incentive to purchase. To win the sale, the firm must offer \nmore customer-perceived value than Komatsu does.36\nMANAGING COMMUNICATION\nAlthough marketing communication is usually associated with consumer markets, it also plays an \nimportant role in business markets. Companies need to inform business customers about the ben -\nefits of their offerings as well as coordinating their activities with collaborators.37 As is the case in \nconsumer markets, business communications are increasingly moving into the online space, using \nsearch engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) to connect with buyers.\nHere are some examples of the way top firms are redesigning their online presence, employ -\ning search engine optimization, engaging in social media, and launching Webinars and podcasts to \nimprove their business performance through B2B marketing.\nChapman Kelly  A subsidiary of HMS Business Services, Chapman Kelly provides \nmedical, dental, and pharmacy claims and dependent auditing services to help firms reduce \ntheir health care and insurance costs. The company originally tried to acquire new customers \nthrough traditional cold calling and outbound selling techniques. After it redesigned its website \nand optimized the site so that the company\u2019s name moved close to the top of relevant online \nsearches, revenue nearly doubled.38\nMakino  Machinery manufacturer Makino builds relationships with end-user customers by \nhosting an ongoing series of industry-specific Webinars, averaging three a month. The company \nuses highly specialized content, such as how to get the most out of machine tools and how metal-\ncutting processes work, to appeal to different industries and different styles of manufacturing. \nIts database of Webinar participants has allowed the firm to cut marketing costs and improve its \neffectiveness and efficiency.39\nKinaxis  Canadian supply chain management company Kinaxis uses a fully integrated \napproach to communications\u2014including blogs, white papers, and a video channel that hinges \non specific keywords to drive traffic to its website and generate qualified leads. With research \nsuggesting that 93 percent of all B2B purchases start with search, Kinaxis puts much emphasis \non search engine optimization (SEO), reusing and repurposing content as much as possible to \nmake it relevant and user-friendly.40\nSome business-to-business marketers are adopting marketing practices from business-to-  consumer \nmarkets to build their brand.41 Xerox ran a fully integrated communication campaign to cleverly reinforce \nthe fact that 50 percent of its revenue comes from business services, not copiers.

Customers that are considering \ndropping six or seven figures on one transaction for big-ticket goods and services want all the informa -\ntion they can get, especially from a trusted, independent source.\nManaging Business-to-Business \nRelationships\nBusiness suppliers and customers are exploring different ways to manage their relationships.43  Loyalty is  \ndriven in part by supply chain management, supplier involvement, and purchasing  alliances.44 Business-\nto-business marketers are using more focused approaches to attract and retain customers, homing in on \ntheir targets, and developing one-to-one marketing approaches.45\nUNDERSTANDING THE BUYER\u2013SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP\nMuch research has advocated greater vertical coordination between buying partners and sellers so \nthat they can transcend merely transacting and instead create more value for both parties.46\nA number of forces influence the development of a relationship between business partners. Four \nrelevant forces are availability of alternatives, importance of supply, complexity of supply, and supply \nmarket dynamism. Based on these forces, buyer\u2013supplier relationships can range from basic buying and \nselling that involves simple, routine exchanges with moderate levels of cooperation and information \nexchange, to a collaborative relationship in which trust and commitment lead to true partnership.47\nOver time, however, relationship roles may shift.48 Some needs can be satisfied with fairly \nbasic supplier performance if buyers neither want nor require a close relationship with a supplier. \n Similarly, some suppliers may not find it worth their while to invest in customers with limited \ngrowth potential.\nOne study found that the closest relationships between customers and suppliers arose when \nsupply was important to the customer and there were procurement obstacles such as complex pur -\nchase requirements and few alternative suppliers.49 Another study suggested that greater vertical \ncoordination between buyer and seller through information exchange and planning is usually nec -\nessary only when high environmental uncertainty exists and specific investments are modest.50\nMANAGING CORPORATE TRUST, CREDIBILITY, \nAND\u00a0REPUTATION\nBuilding trust is one prerequisite to enjoying healthy long-term relationships.51 Tr ust  is a firm\u2019s will -\ningness to rely on a business partner. It depends on a number of interpersonal and interorganizational \nfactors, such as the firm\u2019s perceived competence, integrity, honesty, and benevolence. Personal inter -\nactions with employees of the firm, opinions about the company as a whole, and perceptions of trust \nwill evolve with experience.\nA firm is more likely to be seen as trustworthy when it provides full, honest information, when \nemployee incentives are aligned with customer needs, when it partners with customers to create mar -\nket value, and when it offers valid comparisons with competitive products.52\nBuilding trust can be especially tricky in online settings, and firms often impose more stringent \nrequirements on their online business partners than on others. Business buyers worry that they won\u2019t \nget products of the right quality delivered to the right place at the right time. Sellers worry about get -\nting paid on time\u2014or at all\u2014and debate how much credit they should extend. To this end, many firms \nuse automated credit-checking applications and online trust services to assess the creditworthiness of \ntrading partners.\nCorporate credibility  is the extent to which customers believe a firm can design and deliver products \nand services that satisfy their needs and wants. It reflects the supplier\u2019s reputation in the marketplace \nand is the foundation of a strong relationship. Corporate credibility depends on three factors. Corporate \nexpertise  reflects the extent to which a company is seen as able to make and sell products or conduct \nservices. Corporate trustworthiness  reflects the extent to which a company is seen as motivated to be \nhonest, dependable, and sensitive to customer needs. Corporate likability  reflects the extent to which a \ncompany is seen as likable, attractive, prestigious, and dynamic.\nIn other words, a credible firm is good at what it does; it keeps its customers\u2019 best interests in mind \nand is enjoyable to work with.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4403, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b114575-153f-4378-96d9-7120000778c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b114575-153f-4378-96d9-7120000778c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d24bfc2-660d-4fe4-93b4-ea62f23cc82e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "371c2cca8060e0f17ba164751f40fc9ca300e28e1226c9d2e6fdf574632378d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "38b6b9fd-4341-4d2e-a1e9-51f0f199b0bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap4.pdf"}, "hash": "61ecdb010680f7fec067c47a73bd0253552bc57f41d53e72327805cc8b444f20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18b78bc8-98e5-4096-8694-64eb58d87427", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ec33cb00f847fa45d7cf6ba91a8a82041a434bd6dff0066946a4c83623819e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 4    |  ANAlyzING BUSINESS  MARKETS  93\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNISM IN BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS\nResearchers have noted that establishing a customer\u2013supplier relationship creates tension between \nsafeguarding (ensuring predictable solutions) and adapting (allowing for flexibility for unanticipated \nevents). Vertical coordination can facilitate stronger customer\u2013seller ties but may also increase the \nrisk to the customer\u2019s and supplier\u2019s specific investments.53\nSpecific investments  are those expenditures tailored to a particular company and value-chain partner \n(investments in company-specific training, equipment, and operating procedures or systems).54 For \nexample, a manufacturer might invest in developing an order-placing and inventory-tracking system \ntailored to the needs of a particular retailer. Such specific investments help improve the effectiveness \nand cost efficiency of the collaboration between business entities.55\nSpecific investments, however, also entail considerable risk to both customer and supplier. Trans -\naction theory from economics maintains that because initial investments in specific investments can \nbe high, firms can be locked into a particular relationship. Furthermore, sensitive information on cost \nand processes may need to be exchanged. A buyer may be vulnerable to holdup because of switching \ncosts; a supplier may be more vulnerable because it has dedicated assets and/or technology/knowledge \nat stake. In terms of the latter risk, consider the following example.\nAn automobile component manufacturer wins a contract to supply an under-hood component \nto an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). A one-year, sole-source contract safeguards the sup -\nplier\u2019s OEM-specific investments in a dedicated production line. However, the supplier may also be \nobliged to work (noncontractually) as a partner with the OEM\u2019s internal engineering staff, using linked \ncomputing facilities to exchange detailed engineering information and coordinate frequent design and \nmanufacturing changes over the term of the contract. These interactions could reduce costs and/or \nincrease quality by improving the firm\u2019s responsiveness to marketplace changes. But they could also \nmagnify the threat to the supplier\u2019s intellectual property.\nWhen buyers cannot easily monitor supplier performance, the supplier might shirk or cheat and \nnot deliver the expected value. Opportunism  is a \u201cform of cheating or undersupply relative to an implicit \nor explicit contract.\u201d56\nA more passive form of opportunism might be a refusal or unwillingness to adapt to changing cir -\ncumstances or negligence in satisfying contractual obligations. When Peanut Corporation of  America, \na peanut-processing company with only $25 million in sales, was found to have a contaminated prod -\nuct, a $1 billion recall resulted because the ingredient was found in 2,000 other products. The com -\npany subsequently ceased all manufacturing and business operations, and its CEO was imprisoned for \nknowingly shipping tainted food.57\nOpportunism is a concern because firms must devote resources to control and monitoring that \nthey could otherwise allocate to more productive purposes. Contracts may be inadequate to govern \nsupplier transactions when supplier opportunism becomes difficult to detect, when firms make spe -\ncific investments in assets they cannot use elsewhere, and when contingencies are harder to anticipate. \nCustomers and suppliers are more likely to form a joint venture (which implies a greater level of com -\nmitment to the collaborative relationship than signing a simple contract) when the supplier\u2019s degree \nof asset specificity is high and monitoring the supplier\u2019s behavior is difficult.58\nThe presence of a significant future time horizon and/or strong solidarity norms typically causes \ncustomers and suppliers to strive for joint benefits. Their specific investments shift from expropriation \n(increased opportunism on the receiver\u2019s part) to bonding (reduced opportunism).59\nMANAGING INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS\nOur discussion has concentrated largely on the buying behavior of profit-seeking companies. Much of \nwhat we have said also applies to the buying practices of institutional and government organizations. \nHowever, we want to highlight certain special features of these markets.\nThe institutional market  consists of schools, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other insti -\ntutions that must provide goods and services to people in their care. Many of these organizations are \ncharacterized by low budgets and captive clienteles. For example, hospitals must decide what quality \nof food to buy for patients. The buying objective here is not profit because the food is provided as part \nof the total service package; nor is cost minimization the sole objective because poor food will cause \npatients to complain and hurt the hospital\u2019s reputation. The hospital purchasing agent must search \nfor institutional food vendors whose quality meets or exceeds a certain minimum standard and whose \nprices are low. In fact, many food vendors set up a separate sales division to cater to institutional buy -\ners\u2019 special needs and characteristics.

Aramark\u2014which provides food services \nfor stadiums, arenas, campuses, businesses, and schools\u2014also has a competitive advantage in provid -\ning food for the nation\u2019s prisons, a direct result of refining its purchasing practices and supply chain \nmanagement.\nAramark  Where Aramark once merely selected products from lists provided by potential \nsuppliers, it now collaborates with suppliers to develop products customized to meet the needs \nof individual segments. In the corrections segment, quality has historically been sacrificed to \nmeet limits on food costs that operators outside the market would find impossible to work with. \n\u201cWhen you go after business in the corrections field, you are making bids that are measured in \nhundredths of a cent,\u201d says John zillmer, the president of Aramark Food & Support Services, \u201cso \nany edge we can gain on the purchasing side is extremely valuable.\u201d Aramark sourced a series \nof protein products with unique partners at price points it never could have imagined before. \nThese partners were unique because they understood the chemistry of proteins and knew how \nto lower the price while still creating a product acceptable to Aramark\u2019s customers, allowing the \ncompany to drive down costs. Aramark replicated this process with 163 different items formulated \nexclusively for corrections. Rather than reducing food costs by the usual 1 cent or so per meal, \nAramark took 5 to 9 cents off\u2014while maintaining or even improving quality.60\nIn most countries, government organizations are a major buyer of goods and services. They \ntypically require suppliers to submit bids and often award the contract to the lowest bidder, some -\ntimes making allowance for suppliers known for superior quality or for completing contracts on time. \n Governments may also buy on a negotiated-contract basis, primarily for complex projects with major \nR&D costs and risks and projects for which there is little competition.\nBecause their spending decisions are subject to public review, government organizations require \nconsiderable paperwork from suppliers, who often complain about bureaucracy, regulations, decision-\nmaking delays, and frequent shifts in procurement staff. Different types of agencies\u2014defense, civilian, \nintelligence\u2014have different needs, priorities, purchasing styles, and time frames. In addition, vendors \noften do not pay enough attention to cost justification, a major activity for government procurement \nprofessionals. Companies hoping to become government contractors need to help government agen -\ncies see the bottom-line impact of products. Demonstrating useful experience and successful past \nperformance through case studies, especially with other government organizations, can be influential.\nJust as companies provide government agencies with guidelines about how best to purchase and \nuse their products, governments provide would-be suppliers with detailed guidelines describing how \nto sell to the government. Failure to follow the guidelines or to fill out forms and contracts correctly \ncan create a legal nightmare.\nFortunately for businesses of all sizes, the federal government has been trying to simplify the \ncontracting procedure and make bidding more attractive. Reforms place more emphasis on buying off-\nthe-shelf rather than customized items, communicating with vendors online to eliminate paperwork, \nand debriefing losing vendors to improve their chances of winning the next time around.\nSeveral federal agencies that act as purchasing agents for the rest of the government have launched \nweb-based catalogs that allow authorized defense and civilian agencies to buy everything from medical \nand office supplies to clothing online. The General Services Administration (GSA), for example, not \nonly sells stocked merchandise through its website but also creates direct links between buyers and \ncontract suppliers. A good starting point for any work with the U.S. government is to make sure the \ncompany is in the System for Award Management (SAM) database, which collects, validates, stores, \nand disseminates data in support of agency acquisitions.\n2.

Ma saw that small manufacturers and \nentrepreneurs in China had little access to overseas buyers at \nthe time. In addition, only large companies had the capability \nof tapping into Chinese manufacturing because of the harsh \nregulations. Alibaba.com was created to solve this issue by \nacting as a fast, simple, and efficient intermediary between \nChinese manufacturers and international buyers.

First, Ma believes \nthat Chinese sellers are extremely frugal. Sellers and  buyers \nwould not be interested in a marketplace that entails high \nmonetary costs. With this in mind, Alibaba made all of the \nbasic services on its platform free to use. The company earns \nrevenue through online advertisements and premium features \nthat sellers can opt to pay for, such as web design to customize \ntheir storefronts. Basic storefronts without customization can \nlook cluttered, incentivizing sellers to make theirs stand out. \nMa\u2019s second insight is that Chinese users are wary of trusting \nstrangers on online websites. To avoid this problem, Alibaba.\ncom established a service in which third parties verify the claims \nmade by sellers to ensure legitimacy. In addition, Alibaba cre -\nated the Alipay system, which takes buyers\u2019 money up front and \nputs it in escrow so that the seller can be assured of payment.\nAlibaba.com also benefits from the network-ranking \neffect. The impressive scale of Alibaba and its various plat-\nforms typically means it comes up as the top link when \nprospective buyers search for goods on Baidu, China\u2019s \nequivalent of Google. This results in a greater number of buy-\ners for Alibaba. More buyers create the need for more sellers, \nand more sellers create greater options and variety for new \nbuyers, forming a positive feedback loop. This feedback loop \nhas made it more difficult for both foreign and domestic rivals \nlike Tencent and Amazon to compete.\nCommunication issues often become major challenges \nfor many B2B marketplaces, so Alibaba has taken steps \nto improve communication between sellers and buyers. To address language barriers, Alibaba has created fifteen dif-\nferent language sites, ranging from Hebrew to Vietnamese, \nto help suppliers sell to non-English-speaking businesses. \nAlibaba\u2019s platform allows suppliers to create posts using local \nlanguages, or they can use the automatic translating tool \nservice to translate to/from English directly. To create better \ndirect communication between sellers and buyers, Alibaba \nalso offers the AliSuppliers mobile app, which allows sell-\ners to manage inquiries from buyers and adjust their orders \naccordingly. They can also chat with buyers using the Trade-\nManager function. The AliSource Pro tool, available to all \nbuyers, helps pair businesses and suppliers. Buyers can post \ndescriptions of the product(s) they\u2019re looking for, with specific \ndetails such as order quantity. Alibaba then reviews these \nposts and, within 24 hours, recommends suppliers based on \nthe listed specifications.\nThe Alibaba Group has invested extensive resources in \ndesigning its e-commerce marketplace to be accessible and \neasy to use, which has helped drive the company\u2019s mas-\nsive growth and expansion. China\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day holiday, \non which shoppers celebrate pride in being single by buying \nthemselves gifts, has become the country\u2019s biggest shop-\nping day of the year, largely because of Alibaba\u2019s prolific \nmarketplace.
