Throughout its \nhistory, the company never veered from Jenkins\u2019s philosophy of treating employees and  customers \nlike family. The company\u2019s employees, who are also its largest collective  shareholders, are all \ntrained to put their customers first. As a result, year after year Publix has been recognized as the \nnumber one supermarket by the American Customer Satisfaction Index, has consistently been rated \n highest in customer satisfaction among supermarket pharmacies by J.D. Power, and has been one \nof  Fortune  magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d since the list\u2019s inception. By\u00a0  passionately \nfocusing on creating superior customer value, Publix aims to stay true to its mission to be the \n premier quality food retailer in the world.2\nBecause it is critical to understand the special nature of services and what that means to marketers, in \nthis chapter we systematically analyze services and how to market them most effectively.\nThe Nature of Services\nA service  is an act that one entity performs for another that is essentially intangible and does not \nresult in the ownership of anything. It may or may not be tied to a physical product. Increasingly, \nmanufacturers, distributors, and retailers are providing value-added services, or simply excellent \n customer service, to differentiate themselves.\nServices are everywhere. The government sector \u2014with its courts, employment services, hospitals, \nloan agencies, military services, police and fire departments, postal service, regulatory agencies, and \nschools\u2014is in the service business. The private nonprofit sector\u2014 museums, charities, churches, colleges, \nfoundations, and hospitals\u2014is in the service business. A good part of the business sector \u2014with its air -\nlines, banks, hotels, insurance companies, law firms, management consulting firms, medical prac -\ntices, motion picture companies, plumbing repair companies, and real estate firms\u2014is in the service \n business. Many workers in the manufacturing sector \u2014such as computer operators, accountants, and \nlegal staff\u2014are really service providers. In fact, they make up a \u201cservice factory\u201d providing services to \nthe \u201cgoods factory.\u201d And those in the retail sector \u2014such as cashiers, clerks, salespeople, and customer-\nservice representatives\u2014are also providing a service.\n9.1  Define the distinctive characteristics  \nof services.\n9.2  Explain the new realities that service  \nfirms face.9.3  Identify the key strategies to achieve service \nexcellence.\n9.4  Explain how service firms can manage quality \neffectively.Learning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efb20a6d-26be-4bdd-b5a0-a055347eebda": {"__data__": {"id_": "efb20a6d-26be-4bdd-b5a0-a055347eebda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b2f914e-4ec9-4ee6-b21f-e6431baee9bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "4f39835e472e4bebcd43184c53ceee795675cf5a6754757ce7e77b370ba6a45a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74adbbe3-d354-4838-8f06-ff61d263f3d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "69f06b762b74c9eeba82ee783150cbd242d0132bdac652a2aacf20b77e987292", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27da24cf-4d48-422a-ae3e-6607910022c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fe67482efdabb450e0fe861129a376c8de1f9e5af1610be88a3487342d425a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "184 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nTHE SERVICE ASPECT OF AN OFFERING\nService can be a major or minor component of a company\u2019s offering. Based on the degree to which \nthey involve a service, we distinguish five categories of offerings:\n\u2022 A pure tangible good , such as soap, toothpaste, or salt, with virtually no accompanying services.\n\u2022 A tangible good with accompanying services , like a car, computer, or cell phone with a war -\nranty or specialized customer-service contract. Typically, the more technologically advanced the \nproduct, the greater the need for high-quality supporting services.\n\u2022 A hybrid offering , like a restaurant meal, of equal parts goods and services. People patronize \nrestaurants for both the food and its preparation.\n\u2022 A major service with accompanying minor goods and services , like air travel with sup -\nporting goods such as snacks and drinks.

Panera has \ninnovated in a number of different ways, infusing a strong social conscience in much that it does. \nWith the slogan \u201cLive Consciously. Eat Deliciously,\u201d Panera leads a number of social and community \ninitiatives such as the Panera Bread Foundation, collaborations with Feeding America, and \ndonations to local hunger-relief agencies and charities. The company has also boosted its digital \nspending and boasts a loyalty program, which accounts for a significant portion of its transactions.3\n>> Panera Bread has \nachieved success by \ncombining the speed, \nconvenience, and pric-\ning appeal of fast-food \noutlets with the qual-\nity offerings and menu \nvariety of traditional \nrestaurants. \nSource: Jonathan Weiss/Alamy Stock PhotoCustomers sometimes cannot judge the quality of some services even after they have received \nthem.

Waste spilled into the hallways, \nand decks below became insufferably hot. When the boat returned to shore after a long five \ndays, the CEO greeted passengers as they disembarked and gave each of them $500, a free \nflight home, a refund for the trip, and credit for another cruise. Nevertheless, given the publicity \nsurrounding what the media called the \u201cpoop cruise,\u201d the damage had been done. Public opinion \nof cruises as a whole dropped. Carnival found its bookings declining by a hefty 20 percent, \nforcing the company to pass along steep discounts to fill boats. To avoid future problems, the \ncruise line invested $600 million to upgrade its fleet and hired a new VP of Technical Operations to \noversee its safety initiatives. Seven years later, amid the COVID outbreak in March 2020, Carnival \nfaced a similar challenge when it experienced several high-profile outbreaks on its ships, which \nspurred a congressional inquiry into the company\u2019s safety practices.5<< Carnival found \nout the hard way how \nquickly a company\u2019s \nimage and customer loy-\nalty can be undermined \nwhen an engine fire on \nits Carnival Triumph left \nmore than 3,000 passen-\ngers with limited access \nto food, water, and work -\ning toilets.\nSource: Debbie Ann Powell/Alamy Stock Photo\nDISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF SERVICES\nResearchers delineate four key characteristics that distinguish services from products: intangibility, \ninseparability, variability , and perishability .6 Understanding these unique aspects of service delivery is \nimportant, because they can greatly affect the design of marketing programs. We discuss these four \naspects of services in more detail next.\nIntangibility.  Unlike physical products, services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled \nbefore they are bought. A person getting cosmetic surgery cannot see the results beforehand, and the \npatient in the psychiatrist\u2019s office cannot know the exact outcome of treatment. To reduce uncertainty, \nbuyers will look for evidence of quality by drawing inferences from the place, people, equipment, \ncommunication material, symbols, and price. Therefore, the service provider\u2019s task is to \u201cmanage the \nevidence\u201d\u2014to \u201ctangibilize the intangible.\u201d7\nService companies can try to demonstrate their service quality by emphasizing their tangible \naspects. Because there is no physical product, the service provider\u2019s facilities\u2014such as its primary \nand secondary signage, environmental design and reception area, employee apparel, and collateral \nmaterial\u2014are especially important. All aspects of the service delivery process can be branded, which \nis why Allied Van Lines is concerned about the appearance of its drivers and laborers, why UPS has Because services are generally high in experience and credence qualities, there is more risk involved \nin their purchase, with several consequences. First, service consumers generally rely on word of mouth \nrather than advertising. Second, they rely heavily on price, provider, and physical cues to judge quality. \nThird, they are highly loyal to service providers who satisfy them. Finally, because switching costs are \nhigh, consumer inertia can make it challenging to entice business away from a competitor.\nAlthough customer loyalty can be strong for services, in today\u2019s modern communications envi -\nronment, a service failure can be a PR nightmare and undermine that loyalty, as Carnival Cruises found.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3719, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3930b37-7f52-4f89-81c4-95c8605539cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3930b37-7f52-4f89-81c4-95c8605539cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc208bfc-aa47-44c8-8ccc-97a4d8938ef8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "78284e95353dfa3da335e3438a5c4ee6cbd543b246cff611576408bc676d355e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "27da24cf-4d48-422a-ae3e-6607910022c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "742c4e4635b310986bcb4aa3aa7c61b00f80bf8ac68402a07be986a7f3158f25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a6ad384-f718-4d16-b1b0-8e371994a125", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c91ff447ca46dc84c38dd55de0f7e39a8432a4c05cd380808e12e0afeae9860", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "186 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\ndeveloped such strong equity with its brown trucks, and why Doubletree by Hilton Hotels & Resorts \noffers fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies to symbolize care and friendliness.\nService providers often choose brand elements such as logos, symbols, characters, and slogans to \nmake the service and its key benefits more tangible; consider the \u201cfriendly skies\u201d of United, the \u201cgood \nhands\u201d of Allstate, and the \u201cbullish\u201d nature of Merrill Lynch. Disney is a master at \u201ctangibilizing the \nintangible\u201d and creating magical fantasies in its theme parks. So are retailers such as Dick\u2019s Sporting \nGoods and Bass Pro Shops.8 Apple tangibilized its customer service by creating its \u201cGenius Bar\u201d\u2014a tech \nsupport station inside Apple\u2019s stores, aiming to provide concierge-style customer support.\nBanks and financial institutions are particularly inclined to add a tangible dimension to their \n services\u2014by securing a prestigious office address and an imposing building structure\u2014in order to convey \na sense of stability and instill trust. In addition, many financial institutions, including  Scotiabank, MetLife, \nChase, Citi, SunTrust, US Bank, Barclays, and Bank of America, have paid upwards of $100\u00a0  million (and \nin some cases over $500 million) for the naming rights to major stadiums and sports arenas.9\nInseparability.  Whereas physical goods are manufactured, inventoried, distributed, and later \nconsumed, services are typically produced and consumed simultaneously.10 A haircut can\u2019t be stored, \nnor can it be produced without the barber. The provider is part of the service. Because the client is also \noften present, provider\u2013client interaction is a special feature of services marketing. When clients have \nstrong provider preferences, the provider can raise its price to ration its limited time.\nSeveral strategies exist for getting around the limitations of inseparability. The service provider can \nwork with larger groups. Some psychotherapists have moved from one-on-one therapy to small-group \ntherapy to groups of more than 300 people in a large hotel ballroom. The service provider can work faster; \nthe psychotherapist can spend 30 more efficient minutes with each patient instead of 50\u00a0less structured \nminutes and thus see more patients. The service organization can train more service providers and build \nclient confidence, as H&R Block has done with its national network of trained tax consultants.\nA common approach to addressing the inseparability aspect of services is yield management\u2014a \npricing strategy that aims to optimize customer demand based on the available capacity of the service \nprovider. Because services cannot be inventoried to increase availability at times of greater demand, ser -\nvice providers use variable pricing to influence consumer behavior by \nsetting a price point at which consumer demand matches a company\u2019s \ncapacity. For example, resorts are subject to seasonal fluctuations in \ndemand, restaurants tend to be busier on weekends, and airlines experi -\nence higher than usual demand around holidays such as Thanksgiving, \nChristmas, and New Year\u2019s Eve. By varying their price, companies are \nable to influence customer demand in a way that matches their capacity.\nVariability.  The quality of services depends on who provides \nthem\u2014as well as on when, where, and to whom; thus, services are \nhighly variable. Because service delivery is an interactive experience, \nthe actual service received by customers varies across individual cus -\ntomers and service providers. Service firms know that variability in \ntheir performance puts them at risk.

To reassure customers, some firms offer service \nguarantees  that may reduce consumer perceptions of risk.12 Here are three steps that service firms can \ntake to increase quality control.\n\u2022 Invest in good hiring and training procedures.  Recruiting the right employees and giving \nthem excellent training are crucial elements of quality control, whether employees are highly \nskilled professionals or low-skilled workers. Better-trained people exhibit six characteristics that \nimprove service quality: competence, courtesy, credibility, reliability, responsiveness, and com -\nmunication skill.\n\u2022 Standardize the service-performance process throughout the organization.  A service \nblueprint  can map out the service process, the points of customer contact, and the evidence of \nservice from the customer\u2019s point of view.13 Figure 9.1 shows a service blueprint for an overnight \nguest at a hotel.14 Behind the scenes, the hotel must skillfully help the guest move from one step \nto the next. Service blueprints can be helpful in identifying potential \u201cpain points\u201d for custom -\ners, developing new services, supporting a zero-defects culture, and devising service recovery \nstrategies.\n\u2022 Monitor customer satisfaction.  Reduce service variability by employing suggestion and \ncomplaint systems, customer surveys, and third-party comparison shopping. Customer needs \nmay vary in different areas, allowing firms to develop region-specific customer satisfaction \n programs.15 Firms can also develop customer information databases and systems for more per -\nsonalized service, especially online.16\nPerishability.  Services cannot be stored, so their perishability can be a problem when demand \nfluctuates. To accommodate rush-hour demand, public transportation companies must own more \nequipment than if demand were even throughout the day.

Several \nstrategies can produce a better match between service demand and \n supply.17 On the demand (customer) side, we can identify the fol -\nlowing strategies:\n\u2022 Differential pricing  will shift some demand from peak to off-peak \nperiods. Examples include lower matinee movie prices and week -\nend discounts for car rentals.18\n\u2022 Nonpeak demand  can be cultivated. McDonald\u2019s pushes breakfast \nservice, and hotels promote minivacation weekends.\n\u2022 Complementary services  can provide alternatives for waiting cus -\ntomers, such as cocktail lounges in restaurants and automated \nteller machines in banks.\n\u2022 Reservation systems  are a way to manage the demand level. Airlines, \nhotels, and physicians employ them extensively.\nPerhaps one of the most popular approaches to balancing sup -\nply and demand in service delivery is yield pricing . For example, \nhighway operators use dynamic pricing to optimize traffic. Ferrovial \nSA\u2019s  Cintra unit has opened several toll roads in the Dallas area that \ncan change prices every five minutes to keep speeds above 50 miles \nan hour. The toll for one 7-mile stretch, for instance, can fluctuate \nbetween 90 cents and $4.50. In the same vein, sports teams, bands, \nski resorts, and theme parks have begun adjusting prices based \non demand. Dynamic pricing can produce results. Consider the \n Indianapolis Zoo.\nIndianapolis Zoo  The Indianapolis Zoo adopted dynamic pricing in part to limit crowds \nafter opening a new orangutan center. As a result, adult passes that used to cost $16.95 were \npriced between $8 and $30, based on advance sales and expected demand. For example, \nthe Zoo discounts cold weekdays in the winter and boosts prices after school groups book \ndozens of tickets. The dynamic pricing produced tangible results: Two-thirds of guests \nvisited on weekdays the following summer, compared with 57 percent in the past. In the year \nfollowing the introduction of this yield-management pricing, the zoo\u2019s admission revenue grew \n12\u00a0percent.19>> Dynamic pricing \nbased on advance sales \nand anticipated demand \nhas helped the Indianap-\nolis Zoo to simultane-\nously control the number \nof visitors and increase \nrevenue.\nSource: Wm. Baker/GhostWorx Images/Alamy Stock Photo\nOn the supply side, the following strategies can facilitate yield management:\n\u2022 Part-time employees  can serve peak demand. Colleges add part-time teachers when enrollment goes \nup; stores hire extra clerks during holiday periods.\n\u2022 Peak-time efficiency routines  can allow employees to perform only essential tasks during peak periods. \nParamedics assist physicians during busy periods.\n\u2022 Increased consumer participation  frees up service providers\u2019 time. Consumers fill out their own medi -\ncal records or bag their own groceries.\n\u2022 Shared services  can improve offerings. Several hospitals can share medical-equipment \npurchases.\n\u2022 Facilities for future expansion  can be a good investment. An amusement park might buy surrounding \nland for later development.\nFor fast-food chains, drive-through windows are a way to expand selling opportunities beyond sit-\ndown meals. An impressive 70 percent of revenue for the fast-food industry comes via drive-through \nwindows. According to QSR  magazine, Taco Bell operates some of the fastest and most accurate drive-\nthrough windows. The company aims for 3 minutes and 30 seconds per order and is constantly looking \nfor ways to shave seconds and cut costs.20", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3656, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80651d84-af2a-47b5-bebe-a5e07b9a07d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "80651d84-af2a-47b5-bebe-a5e07b9a07d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d007951a-fdc9-4e17-80ee-5b8369f16131", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "cf72f2c11969cf315aa6c1d7782f780ba12646b85f7b7bdd8ead3724f4f5cba2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fe9b9ac-4deb-424e-aae8-78bd6b3ff518", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "fc99358fe865ff01ea86b2b7489c6ae91d39ca5e6d8842dd806988ae87065b7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8bb647e-183f-4cc4-abb9-1fb4830ec87e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5682cd25bd062666c413e7d49569b91b8ea2d44289c983ef3b58b555dea9a669", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 9    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  SERVICES   189\nThe New Services Realities\nService firms once lagged behind manufacturers in their understanding and use of marketing because \nthey were small or faced large demand or little competition. This has certainly changed. Some of the \nmost skilled marketers now are service firms.\nSavvy services marketers are recognizing the new services realities, such as the increasing role of \ntechnology, the importance of the increasingly empowered customer, customer coproduction, and the \nneed to engage employees as well as customers.\nINCREASING ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology is changing the rules of the game for services in a very fundamental way. Banking, for \ninstance, is being transformed by the ability to bank online and via mobile apps; some customers \nrarely see a bank lobby or interact with an employee anymore. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated \nthe digital transformation of services by forcing many companies to change course and transform \ntheir businesses by integrating digital technology to fundamentally change how they deliver value \nto their customers.\nTechnology also has great power to make service workers more productive. However, companies \nmust avoid pushing technological efficiency so hard that they reduce perceived quality.21 Amazon \nhas some of the most innovative technology in online retailing, but it also keeps customers extremely \nsatisfied when a problem arises, even if they don\u2019t actually talk to an Amazon employee. More compa -\nnies have introduced \u201clive chat\u201d features to blend technology with a human voice. One company that \nenables enterprises to connect with customers across different touch points\u2014from text messages to \nemails, phone calls to video, intelligent chatbots and back\u2014is Twilio.\nTwilio  Twilio, the leading cloud communications platform, is used by millions of developers \naround the world to \u201cvirtualize\u201d the telecommunications infrastructure and improve the human \ninteraction experience.

But as companies collect, store, \nand use more information about customers, concerns about security and privacy arise. Companies \nmust incorporate the proper safeguards and reassure customers about their efforts to keep customers\u2019 \nprivate information secure.\nCUSTOMER EMPOWERMENT\nThe digital era has clearly altered customer relationships. Customers are becoming more sophisti -\ncated about buying product-support services and are pressing for \u201cunbundled services\u201d and the right \nto select the elements they want. They increasingly dislike having to deal with a multitude of service \nproviders handling different types of products or equipment. With that in mind, some third-party \nservice organizations now service a greater range of equipment. A plumbing business may also service \nair conditioners, furnaces, and other components of a household infrastructure.\nMost important, social media have empowered customers by letting them send their comments \naround the world with a mouse click. A person who has a good customer experience is more likely to \ntalk about it, but someone who has a bad experience will talk to more people. Ninety percent of angry \ncustomers reported sharing their story with a friend; they can now share it with strangers too. Online \nsites such as Angie\u2019s List, Yelp, and TripAdvisor are other popular means to spread the word about \ncustomer-service adventures. Even more challenging for firms, unhappy customers may choose to \nupload a damaging video to share their customer-service miseries with others.\nWhen a customer complains, most companies now respond quickly. Many companies allow con -\ntact 24/7 by phone and e-chat, but they also reach out to customers and monitor blogs, websites, and \nsocial media. If employees see a customer report a problem on a blog, they get in touch and offer help. \nClear, helpful e-mail replies to customers\u2019 queries can be very effective. Delta Airlines introduced Delta \nAssist to monitor customer Twitter tweets and Facebook posts around the clock with a 10-person team \nthat provides real-time replies to any queries or problems.\nMore important than simply responding to a disgruntled customer, however, is preventing dis -\nsatisfaction from occurring in the future. That may mean simply taking the time to nurture customer \nrelationships with attention from a real person. Solving a customer\u2019s problem quickly and easily goes \na long way toward winning long-term loyal customers.23\nCUSTOMER COPRODUCTION\nThe reality is that customers do not merely purchase and use a service; they play an active role in its \ndelivery. Their words and actions affect the quality of their service experiences and those of others, \nas well as the productivity of frontline employees.24\nCustomers often believe they derive more value, and feel a stronger connection to the service pro -\nvider, if they are actively engaged in the service process. This coproduction can put stress on employees, \nhowever, and reduce their satisfaction, especially if they do not share the same values, interests, or \nknowledge with their customers.25 Moreover, one study estimated that one-third of all service prob -\nlems are caused by the customer.26 The growing shift to self-service technologies is likely to increase \nthis percentage.\nPreventing service failures is crucial because recovery is always challenging. One of the biggest \nproblems is attribution. Customers often feel that the firm is at fault or that, even if it is not at fault, \nit is still responsible for righting any wrongs. Unfortunately, even though many firms have well-\ndesigned and well-executed procedures to deal with their own failures, they find managing customer  employees when an IT service goes down, and Airbnb uses it to automatically text information \nabout potential renters to hosts. Building on its communications platform for text, voice, video, \nchats, and messaging apps, Twilio expanded its portfolio of services to include a cloud-based \ncall-center service and a pay app that allows companies to process payments over the phone \nwithout having to read a card number to a representative. To add e-mail capabilities to its portfolio \nof offerings, Twilio in 2019 acquired SendGrid, the leading e-mail API platform, which bolstered \nthe company\u2019s ability to deliver consistent messaging based on its customers\u2019 preferred form of \ncommunication.22", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4680, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b38db5f-9aa7-40f2-9459-4ae6bbf0f8fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b38db5f-9aa7-40f2-9459-4ae6bbf0f8fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "930b2b5c-e789-4e70-b75a-b91fbac03650", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "b8b8c4450baeb11301ccc64f6c6da40c03eb0319b5686b5310f01dda4a114ea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8bb647e-183f-4cc4-abb9-1fb4830ec87e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "def91446ce1222da98cb0573aa5c41c9f52c398a3d2b13065595800a448bbb4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee294478-61d5-4efe-8dbe-8a3b9cb907f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0b0bab5358608bc4ea5475b301a660f602ac75b73ca7ac4af328c719a4249b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 9    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  SERVICES   191\nfailures\u2014service problems arising from a customer\u2019s mistake or lack of understanding\u2014much more \ndifficult.

They need to market a career rather than just a job, design \na sound training program, provide support for employees, and reward them for good performance. \nCompanies can use an intranet, internal newsletters, daily reminders, and employee roundtables to \nreinforce customer-centered attitudes.

Internal \nmarketing  consists of training and motivating employees to serve customers well. Arguably the most \nimportant contribution the marketing department can make is to be \u201cexceptionally clever in getting \neveryone else in the organization to practice marketing.\u201d33 Interactive marketing  reflects employ -\nees\u2019 skill in serving the client. In interactive marketing, teamwork is often key. Delegating authority \nto frontline employees can allow for greater service flexibility and adaptability because it promotes \nbetter problem solving, closer employee cooperation, and more efficient knowledge transfer.34\nBEST PRACTICES OF TOP SERVICE COMPANIES\nWell-managed service companies that achieve marketing excellence share a focus on customer-  \ncentricity, a commitment to service quality, an understanding of the need to cater to high-value cus -\ntomers, and the implementation of strategies for managing customer complaints.\nCustomer-Centricity.  Top service companies are \u201ccustomer obsessed.\u201d They have a clear sense \nof their target customers and their needs, and they have developed a distinctive strategy for satisfying \nthem. At the Four Seasons luxury hotel chain, employees must pass four interviews before being hired. \nEach hotel also employs a \u201cguest historian\u201d to track guest preferences. With more than 10,000 branches \nin the United States (more than any other brokerage firm), Edward Jones stays close to customers by \nassigning a single financial advisor and one administrator to each office. Although costly, maintaining \nsuch small teams fosters personal relationships.35\nCustomer-centricity  means seeing the world in general, and a company\u2019s services in particular, \nfrom the customer\u2019s point of view. Customer-centricity goes beyond providing the services that the \ncompany performs to delivering solutions that customers need. The customer-centric company is \nproactive in identifying and addressing customer needs (rather than being merely reactive and offering \nservices that customers explicitly requested). Companies like The Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, REI, and \nZappos have embraced customer-centricity as the underlying principle of their business models. One \ncompany that wins consistent praise for its brand-building success is Singapore Airlines.its customer-service reps to solve problems. When a customer called to complain that a pair of \nboots was leaking after a year of use, the rep sent a new pair, even though the company\u2019s policy \nis that only unworn shoes are returnable. Every employee has a chance each year to contribute \nto the company\u2019s Culture Book about life at Zappos and how each department\u2014from selling to \nwarehousing, delivery, pricing, and billing\u2014implements superior customer service. Thanks to its \nsuccess, Zappos even offers two-day seminars to business executives eager to learn the secrets \nbehind its unique corporate culture and approach to customer service.30\nSingapore Airlines  Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been consistently recognized as the \nworld\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d airline, in large part thanks to its stellar marketing. The carrier wins so many awards \nthat it has to update its website monthly. Famous for pampering passengers, it continuously \nstrives to create a \u201cwow effect\u201d and surpass customers\u2019 expectations. SIA was the first to launch \non-demand entertainment systems in all classes, Dolby sound systems, and a book-the-cook \nservice that allows business- and first-class passengers to order meals before boarding.

Companies such as Marriott, Disney, and Ace Hardware have a thorough com -\nmitment to service quality. Their managers look monthly not only at financial performance but also \nat service performance. Ray Kroc of McDonald\u2019s insisted on continually measuring each McDonald\u2019s \noutlet on its conformance to QSCV: quality, service, cleanliness, and value. Some companies insert \na reminder with employees\u2019 paychecks: \u201cBrought to you by the customer.\u201d Sam Walton of Walmart \nrequired the following employee pledge: \u201cI solemnly swear and declare that every customer that comes \nwithin 10 feet of me, I will smile, look them in the eye, and greet them, so help me Sam.\u201d Allstate, \nDunkin\u2019 Brands, Oracle, and USAA have high-level senior executives with titles such as chief customer \nofficer, chief client officer, or chief experience officer, who have the power and authority to improve \ncustomer service across every customer interaction.37\nThe best service providers set superior quality standards. In the highly regulated banking industry, \nCitibank still aims to answer customer phone calls within 10 seconds and letters within two days; it \nalso has been an industry leader in using social media for customer service. The standards must be \nset appropriately  high. A 98 percent accuracy standard may sound good, but it would result in 64,000 \nlost FedEx packages a day; six misspelled words on each page of a book; 400,000 incorrectly filled \nprescriptions daily; 3 million lost pieces of USPS mail each day; no phone, internet, or electricity for \neight days per year, or 29 minutes per day; 1,000 mislabeled or (mispriced) products at a supermarket; \nand 6 million people unaccounted for in a U.S. census.\nTop firms audit their own service performance, as well as that of competitors, on a regular basis. \nThey collect voice of the customer measurements  to probe customer satisfiers and dissatisfiers using com -\nparison shopping, mystery or ghost shopping, customer surveys, suggestion and complaint forms, \nservice-audit teams, and customers\u2019 letters. We can judge services on customer importance  and company \nperformance.

Service providers receive low marks for many \n reasons. Customers complain about inaccurate information; unresponsive, rude, or poorly \ntrained workers; and long waits. Even worse, many find their complaints never reach a human ear  \nbecause of slow or faulty phone or online reporting systems. Consumers report that companies \nmishandle online complaints by responding selectively or inconsistently (or not at all) and by \n\u201ccutting and running,\u201d appearing insincere, or attempting to just \u201cbribe\u201d the consumer.

Many firms have decided to coddle big spenders to \nretain their patronage as long as possible.

One type of company that is expert at \nidentifying and catering to high-value customers is the casino.\nCasinos like Caesars Palace, Bellagio, and Harrah\u2019s offer huge perks to high rollers in order \nto persuade them to come and stay as long as possible. This strategy ultimately pays off: \nHigh-profile high rollers, or \u201cwhales,\u201d regularly wager thousands and sometimes millions \nof  dollars in a single night. For many casinos, high rollers represent as much as 50 percent of \ntheir  revenues. Common perks received by high rollers include discounted or comped luxury \naccommodations that often feature a butler and a private chef, a free luxury car and driver, \nand even discounts on gambling losses. Some are also offered meals at  Michelin-starred res -\ntaurants that are located on the premises of the hotel-casinos. High-roller spouses who are not \ninterested in gambling may receive store credit to entice them to spend more time shopping.40\nDelivering services that maximize both customer satisfaction and company profitability can be \nchallenging.

The \nTropicana was not alone in offering overly generous benefits to high rollers; Atlantic City\u2019s \nBorgata and Caesars casinos succumbed to the same fate, losing $9 million to Johnson.41\nManaging Customer Complaints.  On average, 40 percent of customers who suffer through \na bad service experience with a company stop doing business with it.42 However, if those custom -\ners were willing to complain first, they would actually offer the company a gift\u2014provided that the \ncomplaint is handled well. Companies that encourage disappointed customers to complain\u2014and also \nempower employees to remedy the situation on the spot\u2014have been shown to achieve higher revenues \nand greater profits than companies without a systematic approach for addressing service failures.43\nFrontline employees who adopt extra-role behaviors , advocate the interests and enhance the image of \nthe firm to consumers, and take the initiative to engage in conscientious behavior in dealing with custom -\ners can be a critical asset in handling complaints.44 Customers evaluate complaint incidents in terms of the \noutcomes they receive, the procedures used to arrive at those outcomes, and the nature of interpersonal \ntreatment during the process.45 Companies are also looking to improve the way they handle complaints \nby increasing the quality of their call centers  and their customer-service representatives . \u201cMarketing Insight: \nImproving Company Call Centers\u201d at the end of this chapter illustrates what top companies are doing.\nDIFFERENTIATING SERVICES\nWhen the physical product cannot easily be differentiated, the key to competitive success may lie in \nadding valued services and constantly improving their quality. Rolls-Royce PLC has ensured that its \naircraft engines are in high demand by continuously monitoring the health of its airplane engines in \nuse around the world through live satellite feeds. Under its TotalCare and CorporateCare programs, \nairlines pay Rolls a fee for every hour an engine is in flight, and Rolls assumes the risks and costs of \ndowntime and repairs.\nThe main service differentiators are ease of ordering; speed and timing of delivery; installation, \ntraining, and consulting; maintenance and repair; and returns.\nEase of Ordering.  Ordering ease reflects how simple it is for the customer to place an order with \nthe company. As markets become increasingly competitive, many companies focus on making the \nordering process as convenient as possible. This involves streamlining all aspects of a customer\u2019s inter -\naction with the company\u2014from the initial evaluation of the available options to the actual  purchase. \nVoice assistants such as Alexa, Google Home, and Siri have helped make the ordering process even \neasier by using artificial intelligence to predict consumer preferences.\nStriving to simplify the ordering process is not limited to consumer markets. It plays a major role \nin business markets as well. Baxter Healthcare supplies hospitals with computer terminals through \nwhich they send orders directly to the firm, thus streamlining the ordering process. Another example \nof simplifying the ordering process is Align Technology.\nAlign Technology  Align Technology pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with \nthe introduction of the Invisalign system\u2014transparent dental braces used to adjust teeth. The \ncompany was born from the simple observation that the dental retainers commonly prescribed \nafter orthodontic procedures could be used not only to prevent teeth from moving but also to \nrealign teeth. This observation led to the idea that a series of custom-designed aligners could be \nused to straighten misaligned teeth. By 2018, the company\u2019s Invisalign system had been used to \ntreat over 5 million patients and enjoyed wide adoption by dental professionals. To streamline the \ntreatment process, the company introduced a digital scanner that replaced the cumbersome and \ntime-consuming process of taking physical impressions. The use of digital scanning technology \nenabled the company to speed up the ordering process, increase the quality of the impressions, \nand improve the overall customer experience.46", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4989, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fd79a1a-e44b-49f1-bb38-4f437c0f6095": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fd79a1a-e44b-49f1-bb38-4f437c0f6095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca2b3357-b8e4-4dbf-856d-2212acaf3737", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "191ba82f9e617d54023b15840c8e5aa0e0fd1c2c3e9724183b8ca57fe66be4d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49673330-6010-4b1e-a93b-c49fa33db2b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "4113f88f48f7242c287e6fcd96013426dbd3431ca57ef912b3c16b6d84c05889", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5259e0fe-8a0c-47ae-8e08-a9952a8c95d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8bbd8d122a1f1d748edf35985164c42c54f823274349ce81a84e3f0235debe4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "196 PART  4   |  DESIGNING VALUE\nMany companies, especially those offering subscription services, look beyond a single transac -\ntion to ensure that customers continue using the service.

Some of these additional services are part of a maintenance program \nthat that can be purchased by customers. In the consumer space, a number of companies, including \nIKEA, Home Depot, and Best Buy, offer assembly and installation services to their customers for an \nadditional fee.\nMaintenance and Repair.  Maintenance and repair programs help customers keep purchased \nproducts in good working order. These services are critical in business-to-business settings. Goodyear\u2019s \nTVTrack program helps its fleet customers monitor and manage tires more effectively. Many firms offer \nonline technical support, or \u201ce-support,\u201d for customers, who can search an online database for fixes \nor seek online help from a technician. Appliance makers such as LG, Kenmore, and Miele have intro -\nduced products that can transmit self-diagnostic data over the phone to a customer-service number \nthat electronically describes the nature of any technical problems.\nMakers of luxury products especially recognize the importance of a smooth repair process. \nAlthough Movado\u2019s watches are high-end, its repair process had been anything but, requiring time-\nconsuming manual labor and entailing customer inconvenience. Recognizing the need to offer more \ndigital services in general, Movado created a website where customers can buy products directly \nfrom the company as well as execute many of the initial steps in the repair process online (such as \nregistering any problems and identifying possible repair options) before contacting customer service \ndirectly. The database created by users of the site has also allowed the company to recruit  potential \nfocus-group participants and to identify repair trends that may suggest recurring  production \nproblems.48\nReturns.  A nuisance to customers, manufacturers, retailers, and distributors alike, product returns \nare also an unavoidable reality of doing business, especially for online purchases. Free shipping, which \nis growing more popular, makes it easier for customers to try out an item\u2014but also increases the \nlikelihood of its being returned.\nReturns can add up. One estimate is that 10 percent to 15 percent of overall holiday sales come \nback as returns or exchanges, and the total annual cost of dealing with them may be $100 billion.49 \nFor the consumer, returns can be inconvenient, embarrassing, or difficult to complete. Returns have a \ndownside for merchants, too, especially when the returned merchandise is not in resellable condition, \nlacks proper proof of purchase, or is returned to the wrong store. It may even be used or stolen. Yet if \nthe merchant is reluctant to accept returns, customers can become annoyed.\nHowever, product returns do have an upside. Physically returning a product can get the consumer \ninto the store, maybe for the first time. One research study found that a lenient return policy left cus -\ntomers more willing to make other purchases and to refer the company to others.50\nWe can think of product returns in two ways:51 Controllable returns  result from problems or errors \nmade by the seller or customer; they can be largely eliminated with improved handling or storage, \nbetter packaging, and more effective transportation and logistics by the seller or its supply chain \npartners. Uncontrollable returns  result from the need for customers to actually see, try, or experience \nproducts in person to determine suitability; these returns can\u2019t be eliminated by the company in \nthe short run.\nOne basic strategy is to eliminate the root causes of controllable returns while developing pro -\ncesses for handling uncontrollable returns. The goal is to have fewer products returned and put a \nhigher percentage back into the distribution pipeline to be sold again. San Diego\u2013based Road Runner \nSports\u2014which sells running shoes, clothing, and equipment through multiple stores, catalogs, and \na website\u2014trains its salespeople to be as knowledgeable as possible in order to recommend the right \nproducts.

But \nwhereas the current health care system is designed to treat a small number of complex cases, \nretail health clinics address a large number of simple cases. Retail health clinics such as Quick \nCare, RediClinic, and MinuteClinic are often found in drugstores and other retail chain stores \nsuch as Target and Walmart. They typically use nurse practitioners to handle minor injuries and \nillnesses such as colds, flu, and ear infections; to offer various health and wellness services such as \nphysicals and exams for high school sports; and to administer vaccinations. The clinics seek to offer \nconvenient, predictable service and transparent pricing, without an appointment, seven days (and \nevenings) a week. Most visits take no more than 15 minutes, and costs vary from $25\u00a0to $100.55\nPrivate A viation   Initially, private aviation was restricted to those who could own or \ncharter a private plane. Fractional ownership, pioneered by NetJets, allowed customers to pay \na percentage of the cost of a private plane, plus maintenance and a direct hourly cost, making \nit more affordable for a broader customer base. Marquis Jets came up with the simple idea of \nprepaid time on what it calls the world\u2019s largest, best-maintained fleet, offering the consistency \nand benefits of fractional ownership without the long-term commitment.

The company takes traditional \ningredients such as trapeze artists, clowns, muscle men, and contortionists and places them \nin a nontraditional setting replete with lavish costumes, new age music, and spectacular stage \ndesigns. And it eliminates other common circus elements: There are no animals. Each production \nis loosely tied together with a theme such as \u201ca tribute to the nomadic soul\u201d (Varekai) or \u201ca \nphantasmagoria of urban life\u201d (Saltimbanco). The group has grown from its Qu\u00e9bec street-\nperformance roots to become a half-billion-dollar global enterprise, with 3,000 employees on four \ncontinents entertaining audiences of millions annually. Part of its success comes from a company \nculture that encourages artistic creativity and innovation and carefully safeguards the brand. One \nnew production is created each year\u2014always in house and unique: There are no duplicate touring \ncompanies. In addition to Cirque\u2019s mix of media and local promotion, an extensive interactive \ne-mail program to its million-plus-member Club Cirque creates an online community of fans \nthat accounts for 20 percent to 30 percent of all ticket sales.

One dynamic process model of \nservice quality is based on the premise that customer perceptions and expectations of service quality \nchange over time, but that at any given point, they are a function of prior expectations about what will \nand what should  happen during the service encounter, as well as of the actual  service delivered during \nthe last contact.67 Tests of the dynamic process model reveal that the two different types of expecta -\ntions have opposite effects on perceptions of service quality.

Many product companies also have a stronger online presence than before \nand must ensure that they offer adequate, if not superior, service online as well.\nProducts can be augmented with key service differentiators in areas such as ordering, delivery, \ninstallation, customer training, customer consulting, maintenance, and repair. Some equipment \ncompanies, such as Caterpillar and Deere, make a significant percentage of their profits from these \n services.74 In the global marketplace, companies that make a good product but provide poor local \nservice support are seriously disadvantaged.\nThe quality of customer-service departments varies greatly. At one extreme are those that simply \ntransfer customer calls to the appropriate person for action with little follow-up. At the other extreme \nare departments that are eager to receive customer requests, suggestions, and even complaints and \nthat handle them expeditiously. Some firms even proactively contact customers to provide service \nafter the sale is complete.75\nManufacturers usually start by running their own parts-and-service departments. They want \nto stay close to the equipment and understand its problems. They also find it expensive and time-  \nconsuming to train others and typically discover that they can make good money from parts and \nservice if they are the only supplier and can charge a premium price. In fact, many equipment manu -\nfacturers price their equipment low and compensate by charging high prices for parts and service.\nOver time, manufacturers switch more maintenance and repair service to authorized distribu -\ntors and dealers. These intermediaries are closer to customers, operate in more locations, and can \noffer quicker service. Still later, independent service firms emerge and offer a lower price or faster \nservice. A significant percentage of auto-service work is now done outside franchised automobile \ndealerships by independent garages and chains such as Midas Muffler and Jiffy Lube.

Marriott and other firms, such as KeyBank and Ace \nHardware, have consolidated call center operations into \nfewer locations, allowing them to maintain the same num-\nber of reps in the process.\nHiring and training are influential, too. An extensive \nstudy by Xerox demonstrated that a good call center \nworker with a high probability of staying the six months \nnecessary for the company to recoup its $5,000 invest-\nment in training was likely to have a creative rather than \nan inquisitive personality. Thus, in hiring for its roughly \n50,000\u00a0call center jobs, Xerox, instead of emphasizing \nprior experience, now factors in responses to prompts like \n\u201cI ask more questions than most people do\u201d and \u201cPeople \ntend to trust what I say.\u201d\nSome firms are taking advantage of Big Data capa-\nbilities to match individual customers with the call center \nagent best suited to meet their needs. Using something \nlike the methods of online dating sites, advanced analyt-\nics technology mines transaction and demographic infor -\nmation about customers (products or services they\u2019ve \npurchased, contract terms and expiration date, record \nof complaints and average call wait time) and call center \nagents (average call-handling time and sales efficiency) to \nidentify optimal matches in real time.\nFinally, keeping call center reps happy and motivated \nis obviously a key to boosting their ability to offer excellent \ncustomer service. American Express lets call center reps \nchoose their own hours and swap shifts without a supervi-\nsor\u2019s approval.77Many firms have learned the hard way that empowered \ncustomers will not put up with poor service. After Sprint \nand Nextel merged, they set out to run their call centers \nas cost centers rather than as a means of enhancing cus-\ntomer loyalty. Employee rewards were based on keeping \ncustomer calls short, and when management started to \nmonitor even bathroom trips, morale sank. With customer \nchurn spinning out of control, Sprint Nextel adopted a \nplan to emphasize service over efficiency. The company \nappointed its first chief service officer and started reward-\ning operators for solving problems on a customer\u2019s first \ncall rather than for keeping their calls short. After a year, \nthe average customer was contacting customer service \nonly four times instead of eight.\nSome firms\u2014such as AT&T, JPMorgan Chase, and \nExpedia\u2014have established call centers in the Philippines \nrather than India, because Filipinos speak lightly accented \nEnglish and are more steeped in U.S. culture than Indians, \nwho speak British-style English and may use unfamiliar \nidioms.76 Other companies are getting smarter about the \ntypes of calls they send to off-shore call centers, directing \nmore complex calls to highly trained domestic customer-\nservice reps. These work-at-home reps often provide \nhigher-quality service at less cost with lower turnover.\nFirms have to decide how many customer-service \nreps they need. One study showed that cutting just four \nreps at a call center of three dozen sent the number of \ncustomers put on hold for four minutes or more from zero \nto 80.

Because services are generally high in experience and \ncredence qualities, there is more risk in their purchase, service organizations handle servers, telecommunications equipment, and a variety of other equip -\nment lines.\nCustomer-service choices are increasing rapidly, however, and equipment manufacturers increas -\ningly must figure out how to make money on their equipment, independent of service contracts. Some \nnew-car warranties now cover 100,000 miles before customers have to pay for servicing. The increase \nin disposable or never-fail equipment makes customers less inclined to pay 2 percent to 10 percent of \nthe purchase price every year for service.

The \ncompany receives high praise for its excellent service and \nis recognized as the gold standard in the customer-service \ndepartment. By exceeding customer expectations, The  \nRitz-Carlton has become one of the leading companies in \nluxury hospitality.\nThe Ritz-Carlton, which began as The Ritz-Carlton \nInvesting Company, was founded by Albert Keller in the \n1900s. The company had built several hotels along the East \nCoast in cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, \nand Boca Raton. However, by 1940 the company disbanded; \nall but one hotel had been closed down and sold off because \nof financial difficulties brought on by the Great Depression. \nThe Ritz-Carlton in Boston continued operating (it was sold in \n2006 to Taj Hotels) and built the foundation for future hotels. \nIt featured private baths in each guest room, gourmet cuisine, \npersonalized guest experiences, and many more amenities \nthat contributed to a premier luxury experience. In 1983, The \nRitz-Carlton Hotel Company was formed. Led by new man-\nagement, Ritz-Carlton expanded around the globe, adding \nnew properties across the United States, Asia, and Europe.\nThe cornerstone of The Ritz-Carlton\u2019s success is \ncustomer loyalty achieved through exceptional customer \nservice. The customer-service experience is defined by The \nRitz-  Carlton\u2019s Gold Standards, which reflect the values and \nphilosophy by which The Ritz-Carlton operates. The Gold \nStandards can best be described by its mission statement: \n\u201cThe Ritz-Carlton is a place where the genuine care and com-\nfort of our guests is our highest mission.\u201d\nTo ensure consistency in its interactions with custom-\ners, in the 1980s The Ritz-Carlton standardized the language \nused by its employees. Management created a distinct style \nof speech with phrases like \u201cmy pleasure,\u201d \u201cright away,\u201d and \n\u201cWe\u2019re fully committed tonight.\u201d Over time, these phrases \nbegan to sound insincere because employees used them in \nsituations where they didn\u2019t fit.

Nordstrom believed it was better to carry too \nmany sizes in each style than not to carry enough, so that \ncustomers wouldn\u2019t get frustrated by their size not being \nSource: Chuck Pefley/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 3468, "end_char_idx": 4830, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da636429-953e-42e2-822c-a4c94cf8cc6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "da636429-953e-42e2-822c-a4c94cf8cc6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "614e7dcd-b81c-4706-bfbd-772b52ece2bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "efd70c4101b93413ece269f8933aff9b99597b5bd7db0a8f8dc285678f1aa511", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ecaebe1-4948-469b-b237-3306e5f95649", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "data/Chap9.pdf"}, "hash": "8488c4d64ae9fdc3b4cdcd3b25d1747d60e18503963c5e76b7530d9294f6245f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "351929a6-f645-4d83-bda8-0fee30095c07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29b6fa5eb1a06d8743146c9e88465560ca0a47b909e44721b7f4712a397c833e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 9    |  DESIGNING  AND  MANAGING  SERVICES   207\navailable. The\u00a0brothers also instituted a policy of \u201cdecision-\nby- consensus,\u201d which helped move the company along even \nwhen disagreements arose.\nNordstrom grew into the billion-dollar retailer it is today \nunder the leadership of the family\u2019s third generation\u2014Bruce, \nJohn, and Jim Nordstrom\u2014and Jack McMillan. Their philosophy \nfocused on empowering the managers and salesforce to make \ndecisions that favored the customer, not the company. The \ncompany rewarded energetic individuals with an entrepreneurial \nspirit and preferred to hire \u201cnice\u201d people who could be trained to \nsell, rather than seasoned salespeople who weren\u2019t nice.\nIt was during this time that the company also decen-\ntralized its purchasing process. Regional managers were \ngiven the freedom to purchase styles and clothes that fit the \nneeds and tastes of that particular area\u2014that is, managers in \n Minnesota bought very differently than managers in southern \nCalifornia. To cater to each region, the company encouraged \nits sales force to regularly ask customers for feedback about \nwhat products and styles they would like to see in Nordstrom \nstores. Jim Nordstrom explained, \u201cWhen we go into a market, \nour first buy is the worst.\u201d\nToday, Nordstrom continues to set the standard in cus -\ntomer service and loyalty. The company is so well known for its \ncustomer service that true tales of \u201cheroics,\u201d or unusual acts of \ncustomer service, still circulate today. Perhaps the best-known \nstory is how, in 1975, a customer came into a Nordstrom store \nwanting to return a set of tires originally bought at Northern \nCommercial Company, an Alaskan firm that Nordstrom had \npurchased. Although Nordstrom had never carried or sold \ntires, it happily accepted the return and instantly refunded the \ncustomer cash for his purchase. In another example, a sales -\nwoman noticed that a customer had left her plane ticket on \nthe store\u2019s counter. She called the airport and asked for the \ncustomer to be issued another ticket, but the airline refused. \nThe saleswoman immediately jumped into a cab and hand-\ndelivered the ticket to the customer at the airport.\nThere are many other examples of such exceptional cus-\ntomer service, and Nordstrom\u2019s \u201cno questions asked\u201d return \npolicy remains intact today. Its sales representatives send \nthank-you cards to customers who shop there, warm up their \ncustomers\u2019 cars on cold days, and have hand-delivered spe-\ncial orders to customers\u2019 homes. Nordstrom installed a tool \ncalled Personal Book at its registers that enables salespeople \nto record and (later) review and recall customers\u2019 specific \npreferences to better personalize their shopping experiences. \nNordstrom\u2019s sales associates have the freedom to sell mer -\nchandise in any department, giving them even more oppor -\ntunities to develop their relationship with the customers. \nNordstrom also provides customers with multiple channels \nfor shopping, allowing them to buy something online and pick \nit up at a store within an hour.\nThe moment one enters a Nordstrom location, it is \nevident that the stores were developed with the customer \nin mind to create a pleasant, efficient experience\u2014\u201ca \nmemorable experience.\u201d The company believes that it has 15\u00a0seconds to capture the excitement of a customer who \nwalks in the door. Aisles are kept neat and uncluttered, big \ndisplay windows create a bright and open atmosphere, and \nthe layout is easily navigated. The dressing rooms are large \nand well lit with fixtures that imitate natural light; escalators \nare significantly wider than elsewhere, to allow both couples \nand parents with children to stand next to each other; and \nevery component is positioned to create a more residential \nfeeling. The layout of the stores is efficient and free of clutter, \na strategy that has been copied by retailers around the world.\nNordstrom\u2019s customer loyalty program, The Nordy Club, \nrewards customers on four different levels based on their \nannual spending: members ($0 -$499), insiders ($500  +), \ninfluencers ($2,000  +), and ambassadors ($5,000  +).
