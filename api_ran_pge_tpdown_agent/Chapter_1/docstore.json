It aims to give riders looking to take a short journey across town, \nor from the subway or bus to their destination, a convenient mode of transportation that does not \npollute the air or add to traffic. Founded in September 2017 and headquartered in Venice, California, \nBird provides a fleet of shared electric scooters that can be accessed via smartphone. Rather than \nrequiring dedicated docking areas, Bird scooters can be picked up and dropped off on sidewalks \nthroughout the city. The company\u2019s business model has proved immensely popular; in its first year of \noperation its scooters were available in over 100 cities throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, \nand they logged 10 million rides. Facing growing competition from other dockless scooter-sharing Formally and informally, people and organizations engage in a vast number of activities that we \ncall marketing. In the face of the digital revolution and other major changes in the business envi -\nronment, effective marketing today is both increasingly vital and radically new.

It is both an art and a science, and it results from careful planning \nand execution using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. Skillful marketers are continually updating \nclassic practices and inventing new ones to find creative, practical ways to adapt to new marketing \nrealities. In this chapter, we lay the foundation for sound marketing practices by reviewing important \nmarketing concepts, tools, frameworks, and issues.\nThe Scope of Marketing\nTo be a successful marketer, one must have a clear understanding of the essence of marketing, what \ncan be marketed, and how marketing works. We discuss these three aspects of marketing next.\nWHAT IS MARKETING?\nMarketing  is about identifying and meeting human and social needs in a way that harmonizes with \nthe goals of the organization. When Google recognized that people needed to more effectively and \nefficiently access information on the internet, it created a powerful search engine that organized and \nprioritized queries. When IKEA noticed that people wanted good furnishings at substantially lower \nprices, it created knockdown furniture. These two firms demonstrated marketing savvy and turned \na private or social need into a profitable business opportunity.2\nThe American Marketing Association offers the following formal definition: Marketing is the activ -\nity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have \nvalue for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.3 Coping with these exchange processes calls for a \nconsiderable amount of work and skill. Marketing management takes place when at least one party to \na potential exchange thinks about the means of achieving desired responses from other parties. Thus \nmarketing management  is the art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing \ncustomers through creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value .\nWe can also distinguish between social and managerial definition of marketing. A social defini -\ntion of marketing shows the role marketing plays in society; for example, one marketer has said that \nmarketing\u2019s role is to \u201cdeliver a higher standard of living.\u201d Our social definition of marketing: Marketing \nis a societal process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating, offering, and \nfreely exchanging products and services of value with others .

Selling is only the \ntip of the marketing iceberg. Peter Drucker, famed management theorist, put it this way:\nThere will always, one can assume, be need for some selling. But the aim of marketing is to \nmake selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer \nso well that the product or service fits him and sells itself. Ideally, marketing should result \nin a customer who is ready to buy. All that should be needed then is to make the product or \nservice available.5\nWhen Nintendo released its Wii game system, when Apple launched its iPad tablet computer, and \nwhen Toyota introduced its Prius hybrid automobile, these manufacturers were swamped with orders. \nTheir success cannot be attributed merely to the great selling skills of retailers. Rather, their runaway \nsuccess stemmed from the fact that they had designed the right product, based on careful marketing \nhomework about consumers, competition, and all the external factors that affect cost and demand.\nWHAT IS MARKETED?\nMarketing is ubiquitous\u2014it permeates all aspects of the society. Specifically, marketing typically \ninvolves 10 different domains: goods, services, events, experiences, persons, places, properties, orga -\nnizations, information, and ideas. Let\u2019s take a quick look at these categories.\n\u2022 Goods.  Physical goods constitute the bulk of most countries\u2019 production and marketing efforts. \nEach year U.S. companies market billions of fresh, canned, bagged, and frozen food products and \nmillions of cars, refrigerators, televisions, machines, and other mainstays of a modern economy.\n\u2022 Services.  As economies advance, a growing proportion of their activities focus on the produc -\ntion of services. The U.S. economy today produces a services-to-goods mix of roughly two-thirds \nto one-third. Services include the offerings of airlines, hotels, car rental firms, barbers and beauti -\ncians, maintenance and repair people, accountants, bankers, lawyers, engineers, doctors, software \nprogrammers, and management consultants. Many market offerings mix goods and services, such \nas a fast-food meal.\n\u2022 Events.  Marketers promote time-based events, including major trade shows, artistic perfor -\nmances, and company anniversaries. Global sporting events such as the Olympics and the World \nCup are promoted aggressively to companies and fans. Local events include craft fairs, bookstore \nreadings, and farmers\u2019 markets.\n\u2022 Experiences.  By orchestrating several services and goods, a firm can create, stage, and market \nexperiences. Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom lets customers visit a fairy kingdom, a pirate \nship, or a haunted house. Customized experiences include a week at a baseball camp with retired \nbaseball greats, a four-day rock-and-roll fantasy camp, and a climb up Mount Everest.\n\u2022 Persons.  Artists, musicians, CEOs, physicians, high-profile lawyers and financiers, and other \nprofessionals often get help from marketers.6 Many athletes and entertainers have done a master -\nful job of marketing themselves\u2014former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, talk show veteran \nOprah Winfrey, and rock-and-roll legends The Rolling Stones. Management consultant Tom \nPeters, himself a master at self-branding, has advised each person to become a \u201cbrand.\u201d\n\u2022 Places.  Cities, states, regions, and whole nations compete to attract tourists, residents, facto -\nries, and company headquarters.7 Place marketers include economic development specialists, \nreal estate agents, commercial banks, local business associations, and advertising and public rela -\ntions agencies. The Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority has met with much success with \nits provocative ad campaign \u201cWhat Happens Here, Stays Here,\u201d portraying Las Vegas as \u201can adult \nplayground.\u201d\n\u2022 Properties.  Properties involve intangible rights of ownership to either real property (real estate) \nor financial property (stocks and bonds). They are bought and sold, and these exchanges require \nmarketing. Real estate agents work for property owners and sellers, or they buy and sell residential \nand commercial real estate. Investment companies and banks market securities to both institu -\ntional and individual investors.\n\u2022 Organizations.  Museums, performing-arts organizations, corporations, and nonprofits all use \nmarketing to boost their public image and compete for audiences and funds.

Information is disseminated knowledge. It is produced, marketed, and distributed \nby TV and radio news, newspapers, the internet, think tanks, government and business entities, and \nschools and universities. Firms make business decisions using information supplied by organizations \nsuch as Nielsen, R.R. Donnelley & Sons, comscore, Gartner, J.D. Power and Associates, GfK, and Ipsos.\n\u2022 Ideas.  Social marketers promote such ideas as \u201cFriends Don\u2019t Let Friends Drive Drunk\u201d and \n\u201cA\u00a0Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste.\u201d Political parties promote social causes such as gun con -\ntrol, tax reform, and affordable health care. As part of their corporate social responsibility activi -\nties, many organizations promote causes focused on issues such as poverty, climate change, civil \nrights, social justice, racial discrimination, gender inequality, health care availability, and child -\nhood obesity.\nTHE MARKETING EXCHANGE\nA marketer is someone who seeks a response\u2014attention, a purchase, a vote, a donation\u2014from \nanother party. Marketers are skilled at stimulating demand for their products; however, that\u2019s a lim -\nited view of what they do. They also seek to influence the level, timing, and composition of demand \nto meet the organization\u2019s objectives.\nTraditionally, a \u201cmarket\u201d was a physical place where buyers and sellers gathered to buy and sell \ngoods. Economists describe a market as a collection of buyers and sellers who negotiate transactions \nthat involve a particular product or product class (such as the housing market or the grain market).\nThere are five basic markets: resource markets, manufacturer markets, consumer markets, inter -\nmediary markets, and government markets. The five basic markets and their connecting flows of \ngoods, services, and money are shown in Figure 1.1. Manufacturers go to resource markets (raw mate -\nrial markets, labor markets, money markets), buy resources and turn them into goods and services, \nand sell finished products to intermediaries, who sell them to consumers. Consumers sell their labor \nand receive money with which they pay for the goods and services they purchase. The government \ncollects tax revenues to buy goods from resource, manufacturer, and intermediary markets and uses \nthese goods and services to provide public services. Every nation\u2019s economy, and the global economy \nitself, all consist of interacting sets of markets linked through exchange processes.\nMarketers view industry  as a group of sellers and use the term market  to describe customer groups. \nThere are need markets (the diet-seeking market), product markets (the shoe market), demographic \nmarkets (the \u201cMillennium\u201d youth market), and geographic markets (the Chinese market), as well as \nvoter markets, labor markets, and donor markets.\nFigure 1.2 shows how sellers and buyers are connected by four flows. Sellers send goods and \nservices and communications such as ads and direct mail to the market; in return, they receive money \nand information such as data on customer attitudes and sales. The inner loop shows an exchange of \nmoney for goods and services; the outer loop shows an exchange of information.\nFIGURE 1.1 \nStructure of Goods, \nServices, and Money \nFlows in a Modern \nExchange Economy\nTaxes,\ngoodsServices,\nmoneyServices,\nmoney\nMoney\nGoods and servicesMoney\nGoods and servicesServices,\nmoney Taxes\nTaxes, goods ServicesTaxes,\ngoodsResources\nMoneyResources\nMoneyResource\nmarkets\nConsumer\nmarketsManufacturer\nmarkets\nIntermediary\nmarketsGovernment\nmarkets", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3778, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b87accf-3848-454c-873e-b26420973e75": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b87accf-3848-454c-873e-b26420973e75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc111429-5438-498f-a81c-284b91461ad4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "b1af6bac01a50c83a32c69b3044f63bad19b4048c1fa9d6ace00e04f13ad48e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5160f560-13d5-4d37-8f8a-cae1f64e439d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "982f40c24737a67c73aafebf2bab61704d3380d10ea6d19693c6f7e8c28b8bd9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fca03be-af0e-4626-9fc8-9d2f51799834", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec4b2583059912bc1d630ecf8c6f870f71328c7ba22c6da420b3014ccbff188e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nFinance, operations, accounting, and other business functions won\u2019t really matter without suffi -\ncient demand for products and services that enable a firm to make a profit. In other words, there must \nbe an effective top line for there to be a healthy bottom line. Thus, financial success often depends \non marketing ability. Marketing\u2019s value extends to society as a whole. It has helped introduce new or \nenhanced products that ease or enrich people\u2019s lives. Successful marketing builds demand for products \nand services, which, in turn, creates jobs. By contributing to the bottom line, successful marketing also \nallows firms to more fully engage in socially responsible activities.8\nIn an online- and mobile-fueled environment where consumers, competition, technology, and eco -\nnomic forces change rapidly and consequences quickly multiply, marketers must choose features, prices, \nand markets and decide how much to spend on advertising, sales, and online and mobile marketing.\nThere is little margin for error in marketing. Just a short time ago, MySpace, Yahoo!, Blockbuster, \nand Barnes & Noble were admired leaders in their industries. What a difference a few years can make! \nAll of these brands have been completely overtaken by upstart challengers\u2014Facebook, Google, Netflix, \nand Amazon, respectively\u2014and they now struggle, sometimes unsuccessfully, for mere survival. Firms \nmust constantly move forward. At greatest risk are those companies that fail to carefully monitor their \ncustomers and competitors and thus fail to continually improve their value offerings and marketing \nstrategies, in the process satisfying their employees, stockholders, suppliers, and channel partners.\nInnovation in marketing is critical. Imaginative ideas on strategy exist in many places within a \ncompany. Senior management should identify and encourage fresh ideas from three generally under -\nrepresented groups: employees with youthful or diverse perspectives, employees far removed from \ncompany headquarters, and employees new to the industry. Each group can challenge company ortho -\ndoxy and stimulate new ideas.\nBritish-based RB (formerly Reckitt Benckiser) has been an innovator in the staid household cleaning \nproducts industry by generating 35 percent of sales from products under three years old. Its multinational \nstaff is encouraged to dig deeply into consumer habits and is well rewarded for excellent performance.\nThe New Marketing Realities\nThe marketplace is dramatically different from even 10 years ago, with new marketing behaviors, \nopportunities, and challenges emerging.9 The new market realities can be divided into three main \ncategories: the market forces that shape the relationships among the different market entities, the \nmarket outcomes that stem from the interplay of these forces, and the emergence of holistic market -\ning as an essential approach to succeeding in the rapidly evolving market.\nFigure 1.3 summarizes the four major market forces, three key market outcomes, and four fun -\ndamental pillars of holistic marketing that help to capture the new marketing realities. With these \nconcepts in place, we can identify a specific set of tasks that make up successful marketing manage -\nment and marketing leadership.\nTHE FOUR MAJOR MARKET FORCES\nThe business environment today has been profoundly influenced by four main forces: technology, \nglobalization, the physical environment, and social responsibility. We discuss these four transforma -\ntive forces in more detail next.\nTechnology.  The pace of change and the scale of technological achievement can be staggering. \nThe rapid rise of e-commerce, online and mobile communication, and artificial intelligence has offered \nmarketers increasing capabilities. Massive amounts of information and data about almost everything \nare now available to both consumers and marketers.FIGURE 1.2 \nA Simple Marketing System\nMoney\nInformationGoods/servicesCommunication\nMarket\n(a collection of buyers)Industry\n(a collection of sellers)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4069, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fca03be-af0e-4626-9fc8-9d2f51799834": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fca03be-af0e-4626-9fc8-9d2f51799834", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75986a48-3788-412d-96b0-d7f3fdf941c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "ea9f72916ce0cb0f9b2a6abb1451fe722966d3ceb3c5c3831e6bb7eba948e12e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b87accf-3848-454c-873e-b26420973e75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "b1af6bac01a50c83a32c69b3044f63bad19b4048c1fa9d6ace00e04f13ad48e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f3f83b5-d00e-42dd-965d-e626c4440a6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc0941940bdb6d7d25afbc5dbf6cbc5c3bc150cbb7b821a2321122f997b63dd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 1    |  DEFINING  MARKETING  FOR  ThE NEw REALITIES   7\nTechnological developments have given birth to new business models that take advantage of the \nnew capabilities stemming from these technologies. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Airbnb, and \nUber that have embraced the new technologies have disrupted markets and become major players in \nthe industries in which they compete.\nAdvances in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have enabled companies \nnot only to better understand their customers but also to tailor their offerings to consumers\u2019 needs \nExponentially increasing computing power\u2014coupled with complex data analysis algorithms that \ninclude natural language processing, object recognition, and affective computing\u2014have provided \nmarketers with unprecedented knowledge about their customers and enabled them to interact with \nthese customers on a one-to-one basis. The growth of data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms \nhave democratized these technologies by making them available to smaller companies that typically \nwould not have had the resources to implement these technologies on their own.\nEven traditional marketing activities have been profoundly affected by technology. To improve \nsales force effectiveness, drug maker Roche issued iPads to its entire sales team. Though the com -\npany had previously used a sophisticated customer relationship management software system, it still \ndepended on sales reps to input data accurately and in a timely fashion, which, unfortunately, did not \nalways happen. With iPads, however, sales teams can do real-time data entry, improving the quality of \nthe data entered while freeing up time for other tasks.\nGlobalization.  The world has become a level playing field that offers competitors across the \nglobe an equal opportunity to succeed. Geographic and political barriers have been eroded as \nadvanced telecommunication technologies and workflow platforms that enable all types of comput -\ners to work together continue to create almost limitless opportunities for communication, collabora -\ntion, and data mining. The notion that the world has become a smaller place connecting businesses \nand customers across the globe is well captured by the phase \u201cThe World Is Flat\u201d coined by Thomas \nFriedman in his book of that name.10\nFriedman illustrates the impact of globalization with the following example: The person taking \nyour order at a McDonald\u2019s in Missouri might be working at a call center 900 miles away in Colorado \nSprings. She then zaps your order back to the McDonald\u2019s so that it\u2019s ready minutes later as you drive to \nthe pickup window. Friedman warns of the consequences of ignoring the rapid pace of global advances \nthat will necessitate changes in the way companies do business, including the loss of American jobs to \nskilled employees who will work for less. In order to succeed in this \u201cflattened\u201d world, the U.S. work -\nforce must continually update its specialized skills and create superior products.\nGlobalization has made countries increasingly multicultural. U.S. minorities have expanding eco -\nnomic clout, with their buying power growing faster than that of the general population. Demographic \ntrends favor developing markets with populations whose median age is below 25. In terms of growth \nof the middle class, the vast majority of the next billion people who join the middle class are likely to \nbe Asian.11FIGURE 1.3 \nThe New Marketing \nRealities\nNew\nconsumer\ncapabilities\nNew\ncompetitive\nenvironmentNew\ncompany\ncapabilitiesRelationship\nmarketing\nIntegrated\nmarketing\nInternal\nmarketing\nPerformance\nmarketingTechnology\nSocial\nresponsibilityPhysical\nenvironmentGlobalizationMarket outcomes Holistic marketing Market forces", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3772, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f3f83b5-d00e-42dd-965d-e626c4440a6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f3f83b5-d00e-42dd-965d-e626c4440a6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f57ed981-a85e-4501-bf6d-374fb3a7ccab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "52ff36036b37a8838167d4e7a6c90f0308efc67ea3078ea28d34fd907d046572", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fca03be-af0e-4626-9fc8-9d2f51799834", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "15ef3576ac621ab2b71329e19637d60d93dd580c88abb62d86928fe2ec8cbb36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f628aa5-3aef-44e9-ae46-fd983ae77357", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbc1ede292316958ccd22c6035535d309b7b8d89d7a3df2ea0eeb7d1c5cdbe1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "8 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nGlobalization changes innovation and product development as companies take ideas and lessons \nfrom one country and apply them to another.

Later, it began to successfully sell the product \nthroughout the developed world for use in ambulances and operating rooms where existing models \nwere too big.12\nPhysical Environment.  The physical environment in which companies operate has changed \ndramatically during the past decade. Two particularly far-ranging changes in the physical environment \ndeserve special attention: climate change and changes in global health conditions.\nClimate change \u2014a term referring to lasting changes in Earth\u2019s global climate as well as changes in \nregional climates\u2014can have a significant impact on a company\u2019s business activities. Climate change is \nnot limited to global warming; it can also involve lower rather than rising temperatures (global cool -\ning). In addition, the effects of climate change go beyond lasting changes in the temperature to trigger \nmore frequent and more extreme weather events, fluctuations in humidity and rainfall, and rising sea \nlevels resulting from thermal expansion of ocean waters and unprecedented melting of glaciers and \nthe polar ice caps.\nClimate change can have a profound effect on the business models of virtually all companies \nregardless of their size or the industry in which they operate. For example, an increase in the average \nannual temperature can lead to lower yields of fruits and vegetables that are accustomed to cooler \ntemperatures and to higher yields of warm-climate vegetation. As the warm season lengthens, warm-\nweather activities tend to grow, whereas winter sports tend to suffer. Rising sea levels are creating major \ndisruptions in global commerce as well as in people\u2019s daily lives. As a result of rising seas and extreme \nweather caused by climate change, Indonesia\u2019s government announced plans to move its endangered \nnational capital from Jakarta to a new location on the island of Borneo. The impact of rising sea levels \nnot only entails frequent flooding; it also means higher rates of erosion, greater damage from storms, \nand saltwater contamination of drinking water.\nHealth conditions  range from short-term illnesses that are confined to a particular geographic \narea to pandemics that spread across the globe. Changes in health conditions can influence not \nonly the operations of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and health management companies but \nalso companies that are not directly related to health care. Pandemics, such as avian influenza and \nswine flu, can have a profound effect on all areas of business, including food, tourism, hospitality, \nand transportation. A truly global pandemic such as COVID-19 could effectively paralyze most, \nif not all, business transactions, leading to a virtual standstill of global commerce. Because the \nprocess of globalization and the related increase in global travel have magnified the probability \nof localized diseases becoming pandemics, managers must be prepared to adapt their business \nmodels to account for changing health conditions that threaten their customers, employees, and \nthe company\u2019s bottom line.\nSocial Responsibility.  Poverty, pollution, water shortages, climate change, social injustice, \nand wealth concentration demand our attention. The private sector is taking some responsibility for \nimproving living conditions, and firms all over the world have elevated the role of corporate social \nresponsibility.\nBecause marketing\u2019s effects extend to society as a whole, marketers must consider the ethi -\ncal, environmental, legal, and social context of their activities.13 The organization\u2019s task is thus to \ndetermine the needs, wants, and interests of target markets and satisfy them more effectively and \nefficiently than competitors, while preserving or enhancing consumers\u2019 and society\u2019s long-term \nwell-being.\nAs goods have become more commoditized and consumers have grown more socially conscious, \nsome companies\u2014including The Body Shop, Timberland, and Patagonia\u2014have incorporated social \nresponsibility as a way to differentiate themselves from competitors, build consumer preference, and \nachieve notable sales and profits.14\nIn making these shifts in marketing and business practices, firms also face ethical dilemmas and \nperplexing trade-offs. Consumers may value convenience but find it difficult to justify disposable \nproducts or elaborate packaging in a world trying to minimize waste. Increasing material aspirations \ncan defy the need for sustainability.

These forces provide both consumers and companies with new capabilities, \nwhile at the same time promoting a competitive market environment. We discuss these three market \noutcomes in more detail next.\nNew Consumer Capabilities.  Consumers today have more power at their fingertips than they \nhave ever had in the past. Expanded information, communication, and mobility enable customers to \nmake better choices and share their preferences and opinions with others around the world. The new \nconsumer capabilities involve several key aspects:\n\u2022 Consumers can use online resources as a powerful information and purchasing aid.  From \nhome, office, or mobile phone, they can compare product prices and features, consult user \nreviews, and order goods online from anywhere in the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week, \nbypassing limited local offerings and realizing significant price savings. They can also engage in \n\u201cshowrooming\u201d: comparing products in stores but buying online. Because consumers and other Toyota Prius  Some auto experts scoffed when Toyota predicted sales of 300,000 cars \nwithin five years of launching its gas-and-electric Prius hybrid sedan in 2001. But by 2004, \nthe Prius had a six-month waiting list. Toyota\u2019s winning formula consists of a powerful electric \nmotor and the ability to quickly switch power sources\u2014resulting in 55 miles per gallon for city \nand highway driving. It also offers the roominess and power of a family sedan and an eco-\nfriendly design and look at a starting price of a little more than $20,000. Some consumers also \nappreciate that the Prius\u2019s distinctive design allows them to make a visible statement about their \ncommitment to the environment. The lesson? Functionally successful products that consumers \nsee as also being good for the environment can offer enticing options.15<< A powerful electric \nmotor combined with a \nquick changeover to gas \nlets the Prius get over \n50 mpg both in the city \nand on highways. It also \nallows owners to display \ntheir concern for the \nenvironment.\nSource: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2788, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c32fead-7fa1-4eba-b89b-b9f2463ef88f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c32fead-7fa1-4eba-b89b-b9f2463ef88f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22b6575b-a4f6-47ac-a0cc-ef8c02e3646e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "da1afb155b0da7c86edea3d804362c4616f55d4376e22bd1fb32585046fd0f1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f628aa5-3aef-44e9-ae46-fd983ae77357", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "0b40d7683aa5fe2f876544064b40de07194ef225eac4c93e01f9607fbcc7b7c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "642aec8f-2576-4e61-85f9-b0a132636749", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60291cbe7ffd2bcdb8c4bc3da0cec3f3d5e09368549c25c82b7a737faaac78d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "10 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nconstituents can fact track down virtually any kind of company information, firms now realize \nthat transparency in corporate words and actions is of paramount importance.\n\u2022 Consumers can use mobile connectivity to search, communicate, and purchase on the \ngo. Consumers increasingly integrate smart phones and tablets into their daily lives. Smart device \nowners use their mobile phones and tablets to research products, shop for everything from gro -\nceries to gifts, contribute to social causes and disaster relief, explore insurance options, send and \nreceive money via online banking platforms, and conduct virtual consultations between doctors \nand patients and among health care teams in far-flung locations. There is one cell phone for every \ntwo people on the planet\u2014and each day10 times more cell phones are produced globally than \nbabies are born. Telecommunications is one of the world\u2019s trillion-dollar industries, along with \ntourism, military, food, and automobiles.\n\u2022 Consumers can tap into social media to share opinions and express loyalty.  Social media \nis an explosive worldwide phenomenon that has changed the way people conduct their everyday \nlives. Consumers use social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and LinkedIn to keep in \ntouch with family, friends, and business colleagues; tout products and services; and even engage in \npolitics. Personal connections and user-generated content thrive on social media such as Facebook, \nInstagram, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Sites like Dogster for dog lovers, TripAdvisor for travel -\ners, and Moterus for bikers bring together consumers with a common interest. At\u00a0Bimmerfest, \nBimmerpost, and BMW Links, auto enthusiasts talk about chrome rims, the latest BMW model, \nand where to find a great local mechanic.\n\u2022 Consumers can actively interact with companies.  Consumers see their favorite companies \nas workshops from which to draw out the offerings they want. By opting to be put on lists, they \ncan receive marketing and sales-related communications, discounts, coupons, and other special \ndeals. With smart phones, they can scan barcodes and QR codes to access a brand\u2019s website and \nother information. Many companies have developed apps that allow them to interact with cus -\ntomers more effectively.\n\u2022 Consumers can reject marketing they find inappropriate or annoying.  Some customers \ntoday may see fewer product differences and feel less brand loyalty. Others may become more \nprice- and quality-sensitive in their search for value. Almost two-thirds of consumers in one sur -\nvey reported that they disliked advertising. For these and other reasons, consumers can be less \ntolerant of undesired marketing. They can choose to screen out online messages, skip commer -\ncials, and avoid marketing appeals through the mail or over the phone.\n\u2022 Consumers can extract more value from what they already own.  Consumers share bikes, \ncars, clothes, couches, apartments, tools, and skills. As one sharing-related entrepreneur noted, \n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from a world where we\u2019re organized around ownership to one organized around \naccess to assets.\u201d In a sharing economy, someone can be both a consumer and a producer, reap -\ning the benefits of both roles.17\nNew Company Capabilities.  In addition to enabling consumers, globalization, social respon -\nsibility, and technology have also generated a new set of capabilities to help companies create value for \ntheir customers, collaborators, and stakeholders. The key company capabilities are as follows:\n\u2022 Companies can use the internet as a powerful information and sales channel, including \nfor individually differentiated goods.  A website can list products and services, history, busi -\nness philosophy, job opportunities, and other information of interest to consumers worldwide. \nSolo Cup marketers note that linking the company\u2019s storefronts to its website and Facebook page \nmakes it easier for consumers to buy Solo paper cups and plates while engaging with the brand \nonline.18 Thanks to advances in factory customization, computer technology, and database \nmarketing software, companies can allow customers to buy M&M candies bearing their names, \nWheaties boxes or Jones soda cans with their pictures on the front, and Heinz ketchup bottles \nwith customized messages.\n\u2022 Companies can collect fuller and richer information about markets, customers, pros -\npects, and competitors.  Marketers can conduct fresh marketing research by using the internet \nto arrange focus groups, send out questionnaires, and gather primary data in several other ways. \nThey can assemble information about individual customer purchases, preferences, demographics, \nand profitability. Many retailers such as CVS, Target, and Albertsons use loyalty-card data to better \nunderstand what consumers purchase, the frequency of store visits, and other buying preferences. \nRecommendation engines help marketers develop purchase suggestions tailored to a user\u2019s past", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "642aec8f-2576-4e61-85f9-b0a132636749": {"__data__": {"id_": "642aec8f-2576-4e61-85f9-b0a132636749", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6eb32242-1acb-4da3-93c4-94d5ddeabf51", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "b23089fb32c63dd8990e0d61b69d5b27a88ca5cd7c905c1c44969e782dec84b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c32fead-7fa1-4eba-b89b-b9f2463ef88f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "7714d9401f483722bde5ba705f17106cfcb171c0b0e9d6820319d18b95d6bdcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccaec2bb-7274-452b-a8a2-73d0da8f5769", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ae7800dd63753e0a0a357d2746a4c880d29f255f1c5861273aba7b1b2b02532", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 1    |  DEFINING  MARKETING  FOR  ThE NEw REALITIES   11\nonline behavior. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Alibaba, and Google have created effective \nalgorithms based on purchase and viewing data, search terms, product feedback, and location to \nfuel their recommendation engines for individual customers. A large share of Amazon purchases \nis derived from product recommendations.\n\u2022 Companies can reach consumers quickly and efficiently via social media and mobile \nmarketing, sending targeted ads, coupons, and information.  GPS technology can pin -\npoint consumers\u2019 exact location, letting marketers send them messages at the mall with wish-\nlist reminders and coupons or offers good only that day. Location-based advertising is attractive \nbecause it reaches consumers closer to the point of sale. Social media and buzz are also powerful. \nFor example, a word-of-mouth marketing agency recruits consumers who voluntarily join pro -\nmotional programs for products and services they deem worth talking about.\n\u2022 Companies can improve purchasing, recruiting, training, and internal and external com -\nmunications.  Firms can recruit new employees online, and many have internet training products \nfor their employees, dealers, and agents. Blogging has waned as companies embrace social media. \n\u201cWe want to be where our customers are,\u201d said Bank of America after dropping its blog in favor \nof Facebook and Twitter.19 Farmers Insurance uses specialized software to help its agents nation -\nwide maintain their own Facebook pages. Via intranets and databases, employees can query one \nanother, seek advice, and exchange information. Popular hybrid Twitter- and Facebook-type prod -\nucts designed especially for business employees have been introduced by Salesforce.com, IBM, \nand numerous start-ups. The Houston Zoo uses the \u201cI want to\u201d button on its intranet to quickly \naccomplish mundane tasks such as ordering business cards and uniforms or communicating with \nthe IT department, leaving employees more time for animal care. The Team Sites tab on Maxxam \nAnalytics\u2019 intranet allows team members in different locations to exchange ideas for improving \nefficiency and customer service, which serves to advance both team and company goals.\n\u2022 Companies can improve their cost efficiency.  Corporate buyers can achieve substantial \nsavings by using the internet to compare sellers\u2019 prices and purchase materials at auction or by \nposting their own terms in reverse auctions. Companies can improve logistics and operations \nto reap substantial cost savings while improving accuracy and service quality. Small businesses \ncan especially unleash the power of the internet. Physicians maintaining a small practice can \nuse Facebook-like services such as Doximity to connect with referring physicians and specialists.\nNew Competitive Environment.  The new market forces have not only changed consumer \nand company capabilities; they have also dramatically changed the dynamics of the competition and \nthe nature of the competitive landscape. Some of the key changes in the competitive environment are \nas follows:\n\u2022 Deregulation.  Many countries have deregulated industries to create greater competition and \ngrowth opportunities. In the United States, laws restricting financial services, telecommunica -\ntions, and electric utilities have all been loosened in the spirit of greater competition.\n\u2022 Privatization.  Many countries have converted public companies to private ownership and man -\nagement to increase their efficiency. The telecommunications industry has seen much privatiza -\ntion in countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Japan.\n\u2022 Retail transformation.  Store-based retailers face competition from catalog houses; direct-mail \nfirms; newspaper, magazine, and TV direct-to-customer ads; home-shopping TV networks; and \ne-commerce. In response, customer-centric companies such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Target are \nbuilding entertainment into their stores with coffee bars, demonstrations, and performances\u2014\nmarketing an \u201cexperience\u201d rather than a product assortment.\n\u2022 Disintermediation.  Early dot-coms such as Amazon.com and E*TRADE successfully created \ndisintermediation  in the delivery of products and services by intervening in the traditional flow of \ngoods. In response, traditional companies engaged in reintermediation  and became \u201cbrick-and-click\u201d \nretailers, adding online services to their offerings. Some with plentiful resources and established \nbrand names became stronger contenders than pure-click firms.\n\u2022 Private labels.  Brand manufacturers are further buffeted by powerful retailers that market their \nown store brands, increasingly indistinguishable from any other type of brand.\n\u2022 Mega-brands.  Many strong brands have become mega-brands and extended into related product \ncategories, including new opportunities at the intersection of two or more industries. Computing, \ntelecommunications, and consumer electronics are converging, with Apple and Samsung releas -\ning a stream of state-of-the-art mobile phones, tablets, and wearable devices.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5108, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccaec2bb-7274-452b-a8a2-73d0da8f5769": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccaec2bb-7274-452b-a8a2-73d0da8f5769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7ad9a21-a549-4d01-b7fe-ca4de004dd87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "50074c41f18a02e2ed06f8d8adda1463a42b52543c1c8fecf905e59f1b64ebb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "642aec8f-2576-4e61-85f9-b0a132636749", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "9c7f54d3c03feff95b28b2b944c4f6ce096d19c4f57211eb5da47807f162133e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "abe1719d-765d-44a0-87ec-721bde82ad0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "605512433376549bd238c0d0a7b9c8c0cd135f69fe21ad23aca6712b39cd47c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "12 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nTHE CONCEPT OF HOLISTIC MARKETING\nHolistic marketing recognizes and reconciles the scope and complexities of marketing activities \nand offers an integrated approach to managing strategy and tactics. Figure 1.4 provides a schematic \noverview of four broad components characterizing holistic marketing: relationship marketing, inte -\ngrated marketing, internal marketing, and performance marketing. We\u2019ll examine these major themes \nthroughout this text.\nTo succeed, marketing must be more holistic and less departmental. Marketers must achieve wider \ninfluence in the company, continuously create new ideas, and strive to gather and use customer insight. \nThey must build their brands more through performance than promotion. They must go electronic \nand build superior information and communication systems.\nThe market value concept calls for a holistic approach to marketing that is focused on building \nrelationships, rather than on generating transactions; on integrated marketing that is both automated \nand creative, rather than on manually managed piecemeal marketing actions; on internal marketing \nthat reflects a strong corporate culture rather than disengaged employees; and on performance-focused \nmarketing that is driven by science rather than intuition.\nRelationship Marketing.  Increasingly, a key goal of marketing is to develop deep, enduring \nrelationships with people and organizations that directly or indirectly affect the success of the firm\u2019s \nmarketing activities. Relationship marketing  aims to build mutually satisfying long-term relation -\nships with key constituents in order to earn and retain their business.\nFour key constituents in relationship marketing are customers, employees, marketing part -\nners (channels, suppliers, distributors, dealers, agencies), and members of the financial community \n(shareholders, investors, analysts). Marketers must create prosperity among all these constituents and \nbalance the returns for all key stakeholders. Forging strong relationships with constituents requires \nunderstanding their capabilities and their resources, needs, goals, and desires.\nThe ultimate outcome of relationship marketing is a unique company asset called a marketing \nnetwork , which consists of the company and its supporting stakeholders\u2014customers, employees, \nsuppliers, distributors, retailers, and others\u2014with whom it has built mutually profitable business \nrelationships. The operating principle is simple: Build an effective network of relationships with key \nstakeholders, and profits will follow. Thus, more companies are choosing to own brands rather than \nphysical assets and are subcontracting activities to firms that can do them better and more cheaply, \nwhile retaining core activities. Nike is a prime example: The sportswear giant\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d marketing \nactivities emanate from its Oregon headquarters, but it outsources all production to overseas locations. \nChina is the largest manufacturer of its footwear and clothing, but other plants are located in Thailand, \nIndia, South Korea, and Vietnam.\nCompanies are also shaping separate offers, services, and messages to individual customers  based on \ninformation about their past transactions, demographics, psychographics, and media and distribution \npreferences. By focusing on their most profitable customers, products, and channels, these firms hope \nto achieve profitable growth and capture a larger share of each customer\u2019s expenditures by building \nFIGURE 1.4 \nThe Concept of holistic Marketing\nIntegrated\nmarketingHolistic\nmarketingInternal\nmarketing\nRelationship\nmarketing\nPerformance\nmarketing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3672, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abe1719d-765d-44a0-87ec-721bde82ad0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "abe1719d-765d-44a0-87ec-721bde82ad0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c5af1556-cd01-4dca-a55f-c21bba63a710", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "ed61fb367c239a074c6ad56a3405cf16571d19149ca2632c2feb50e244f88d2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccaec2bb-7274-452b-a8a2-73d0da8f5769", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "50074c41f18a02e2ed06f8d8adda1463a42b52543c1c8fecf905e59f1b64ebb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "369f76a5-65ad-4d8f-afd4-c5576b7a989c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29c3a545042f6dd0db0abf3e992b9d32111f105a32652835a013aa4dbff187c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 1    |  DEFINING  MARKETING  FOR  ThE NEw REALITIES   13\nstrong customer loyalty. They estimate individual customers\u2019 lifetime value and design their market \nofferings and prices to make a profit over this lifetime.\nThe Marriott chain provides an excellent example of cultivating customer loyalty. Frequent guests \nat its hotels and resorts can climb a tiered rewards ladder from the basic Marriott Rewards member \nrung to accrue an increasing number of perks and bonus points with Lifetime Silver, Lifetime Gold, \nand three Lifetime Platinum levels. After Lifetime status is achieved, it can never be revoked or expire, \nensuring that committed customers receive the benefits of Silver, Gold, or Platinum status with each \nvisit.\nMarketing must skillfully manage not only customer relationships but partner relationships as \nwell. Companies are deepening their partnering arrangements with key suppliers and distributors, \nregarding them as allies in delivering value to end customers so that everybody benefits. IBM has \nlearned the value of strong customer bonds.\nIBM Established over a century ago, in 1911, IBM is a remarkable survivor that has maintained \nmarket position for decades in the challenging technology industry. The company has managed \nto evolve and seamlessly update the focus of its products and services numerous times in its \nhistory\u2014from mainframes to PCs to its current emphasis on cloud computing, \u201cBig Data,\u201d and \nIT services. Part of the reason is that IBM\u2019s sales force and service organization offer real value \nto customers by staying close to them in order to understand their requirements. IBM often even \nco-creates products with customers\u2014for example, working with the state of New York to develop \na method for detecting tax evasion that reportedly saved taxpayers more than $1.5 billion over \na seven-year period. As famed harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter has \nnoted, \u201cIBM is not a technology company but a company solving problems using technology.\u201d20\nIntegrated Marketing.  Integrated marketing  coordinates all marketing activities and market -\ning programs and directs them toward creating, communicating, and delivering consistent value and \na consistent message for consumers, such that \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d This \nrequires that marketers design and implement each marketing activity with all other activities in mind. \nWhen a hospital buys an MRI machine from General Electric\u2019s Medical Systems division, for instance, \nit expects good installation, maintenance, and training services to go with the purchase.\nAn integrated channel strategy should assess each channel option for its direct effect on product \nsales and brand equity, as well as its indirect effect on interactions with other channel options. All com -\npany communications also must be integrated to reinforce and complement one another.

Its enormous plumes of ash created the largest air-travel disruption since \nworld\u00a0war\u00a0II, resulting in a wave of negative press and bad feelings throughout Europe and \nelsewhere. with\u00a0tourism generating around 20 percent of the country\u2019s foreign exchange, and with \nbookings plummeting, government and tourism officials decided to launch \u201cInspired by Iceland.\u201d \nThis campaign was based on the insight that 80 percent of visitors to Iceland recommend the \ndestination to friends and family. The country\u2019s own citizens were recruited to tell their stories \nand encourage others to join in via a website or Twitter, Facebook, and Vimeo.

Marketers now must properly manage all possible touch points: store layouts, \npackage designs, product functions, employee training, and shipping and logistics. Creating a strong \nmarketing organization means that marketers must think like executives in other departments, and \nexecutives in other departments must think more like marketers. Interdepartmental teamwork that \nincludes marketers is necessary to manage key processes like production innovation, new-business \ndevelopment, customer acquisition and retention, and order fulfillment.\nInternal Marketing.  Internal marketing , an element of holistic marketing, is the task of hiring, \ntraining, and motivating able employees who want to serve customers well.

Such interdepartmental harmony can truly coalesce, how -\never, only when senior management clearly communicates a vision of how the company\u2019s marketing \norientation and philosophy serve customers. The following hypothetical example highlights some of \nthe potential challenges in integrating marketing.\nThe marketing vice president of a major European airline wants to increase the airline\u2019s traffic \nshare. Her strategy is to build customer satisfaction by providing better food, cleaner cabins, better-\ntrained cabin crews, and lower fares, yet she has no authority in these matters. The catering department \nchooses food that keeps food costs down; the maintenance department uses inexpensive cleaning \nservices; the human resources department hires people without regard to whether they are naturally \nfriendly and service oriented; the finance department sets the fares. Because these departments gener -\nally take a cost or production point of view, the vice president of marketing is stymied in his efforts to \ncreate an integrated marketing program.\nInternal marketing requires vertical alignment with senior management and horizontal alignment \nwith other departments so everyone understands, appreciates, and supports the marketing effort. For \nexample, the frustrated airline marketing VP might first enlist the help of senior management and \ndepartment heads by illustrating how mounting a coordinated company effort to enhance the com -\npany\u2019s image will make a difference in its bottom line. This might be accomplished by making data on \ncompetitors available, as well as by compiling customer reviews of their experiences with the airline.\nManagement\u2019s engagement will be central in this integrated marketing effort, which must involve \nand motivate all employees\u2014from reservations clerks and maintenance workers to catering depart -\nment employees and cabin crews\u2014by engaging them in a team effort to reinvigorate the airline\u2019s mis -\nsion to provide excellent service. In addition to ongoing employee training that emphasizes customer \nservice, regular internal communications to keep everyone abreast of the company\u2019s actions and single \nout employees who provide outstanding ideas or service can be part of the effort to get the entire \ncompany involved.\nPerformance Marketing.  Performance marketing  requires understanding the financial and \nnonfinancial returns to business and society from marketing activities and programs. As noted previ -\nously, top marketers increasingly go beyond sales revenue to examine the marketing scorecard and \ninterpret what is happening with market share, customer loss rate, customer satisfaction, product \nquality, and other measures. They are also considering the legal, ethical, social, and environmental \neffects of marketing activities and programs.\nWhen they founded Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield embraced the performance \nmarketing concept by dividing the traditional financial bottom line into a \u201cdouble bottom line\u201d that \nalso measured the environmental impact of their products and processes. That later expanded into a \n\u201ctriple bottom line\u201d to represent the social impact, negative and positive, of the firm\u2019s entire range of \nbusiness activities.\nPatagonia  As one of a small number of benefit (B) corporations in the United States that \nmust each year explain how their mission is benefiting both stakeholders and society, Patagonia \naims to combine environmental consciousness with maximizing shareholder returns.

A com -\npany must decide what overarching philosophy will guide a company\u2019s marketing efforts, determine \nhow to organize and manage the marketing department, and, ultimately, find the best means to build \na customer-centric organization that can deliver value to company stakeholders.27\nWhat philosophy should guide a company\u2019s marketing efforts? Let\u2019s first review the evolution of \nmarketing philosophies.\n\u2022 The production concept  is one of the oldest concepts in business. It holds that consumers prefer \nproducts that are widely available and inexpensive. Managers of production-oriented businesses \nconcentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution. This ori -\nentation has made sense in developing countries such as China, where the largest PC manufac -\nturer, Legend (principal owner of Lenovo Group), and domestic appliances giant Haier have taken \nadvantage of the country\u2019s huge and inexpensive labor pool to dominate the market. Marketers \nalso use the production concept when they want to expand the market.\n\u2022 The product concept  proposes that consumers favor products offering the highest quality, the \nbest performance, or innovative features. However, managers are sometimes caught in a love \naffair with their products. They might succumb to the \u201cbetter-mousetrap\u201d fallacy, believing a bet -\nter product will by itself lead people to beat a path to their door. As many start-ups have learned \nthe hard way, a new or improved product will not necessarily be successful unless it is priced, \ndistributed, advertised, and sold properly.\n\u2022 The selling concept  holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, won\u2019t buy enough of the \norganization\u2019s products. It is practiced most aggressively with unsought goods\u2014goods buyers \ndon\u2019t normally think of buying, such as insurance and cemetery plots\u2014and when firms with \novercapacity aim to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants.

It assumes that customers who are coaxed into buying a product not only \nwon\u2019t return or bad-mouth it or complain to consumer organizations, but might even buy it again.\n\u2022 The marketing concept  emerged in the mid-1950s as a customer-centered, sense-and-respond \nphilosophy. The job of marketing is not to find the right customers for your products but to \ndevelop the right products for your customers. Dell doesn\u2019t prepare a PC or laptop for its target \nmarket. Rather, it provides product platforms on which each person customizes the features she \ndesires in the machine. The marketing concept holds that the key to achieving organizational \ngoals is being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating supe -\nrior customer value to your target markets. Harvard\u2019s Theodore Levitt drew a perceptive contrast \nbetween the selling and marketing concepts:28 Selling focuses on the needs of the seller; marketing on the \nneeds of the buyer. Selling is preoccupied with the seller\u2019s need to convert his product into cash; marketing with \nthe idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the product and the whole cluster of things associated \nwith creating, delivering, and finally consuming it .\n\u2022 The  market-value concept  is based on the development, design, and implementation of market -\ning programs, processes, and activities that recognize their breadth and interdependencies. The \nvalue-based view of marketing acknowledges that everything matters in marketing\u2014and that a \nbroad, integrated perspective is often necessary. Traditionally, marketers played the role of inter -\nmediary, charged with understanding customers\u2019 needs and transmitting their voice to various \nfunctional areas.29 In contrast, the market-value concept implies that every  functional area should \nbe actively focused on creating value for customers, the company, and its collaborators.\nThe market-value concept implies that companies should define their business as a customer-\nsatisfying process rather than in terms of their products or industries. Products are transient; basic \nneeds and customer groups endure forever. Transportation is a need; the horse and carriage, automo -\nbile, railroad, airline, ship, and truck are products that meet that need. Viewing businesses in terms \nof customer needs can suggest additional growth opportunities. Table 1.1 lists companies that have \nmoved from a product definition to a market-value definition of their business.\nThe market-value view of a company\u2019s activities can redefine the market in which a company \ncompetes. For example, if Pepsi adopted a product-focused view of its business, it would define its \ntarget market as everyone who drinks carbonated soft drinks, and its competitors would therefore be \nother carbonated soft drink companies. However, if Pepsi adopted a market-value view, it would define \nits market in much broader terms, targeting everyone who might drink something to quench his or \nher thirst. Thus, its competition would also include companies that market noncarbonated soft drinks, \nbottled water, fruit juices, tea, and coffee.\nOrganizing and Managing the Marketing \nDepartment\nThe structure of the marketing department plays a major role in a company\u2019s ability to create market \nvalue. Company success is determined not only by the skills of the individual marketers but also, \nand to a large degree, by the way the marketers are organized to create a high-performing marketing \nteam. In this context, organizing and managing the marketing department are of utmost importance \nin creating a modern marketing organization.TABLE 1.1 Product-Oriented versus Market-Value-Oriented Definitions of a \nBusiness\nCompany Product Definition Market-Value Definition\nUnion Pacific Railroad we run a railroad. we move people and goods.\nXerox we make copying equipment. we help improve office productivity.\nhess Corporation we sell gasoline. we supply energy.\nParamount Pictures we make movies. we market entertainment.\nEncyclopedia Britannica we sell encyclopedias online. we distribute information.\nCarrier we make air conditioners and furnaces. we provide climate control in the home.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5727f9a-d5b7-420d-9aa6-0b65e000dc62": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5727f9a-d5b7-420d-9aa6-0b65e000dc62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "afc4158b-f14c-48e4-b6fa-a11bc5d81e7b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "28237fff8bf19d90c7adb892c38cab6731102fefd91bedc4d0ea9f5ba89c41ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e02fb1f-6aa9-42e3-8531-26014e57920f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "85926a97de4a4721c0716ff208d0d4fd08c0c223f1dddbdd40dd3c0d3f330a61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0cf56453-05ca-401f-88bd-4ab9c363914e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bd568083941f2c92f2fef6f9a857a291f9559f20023771f9e2c3e804e994123", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nORGANIZING THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT\nModern marketing departments can be organized in a number of different, sometimes overlapping \nways: functionally, geographically, by product or brand, by market, or in a matrix.\nFunctional Organization.  In the most common form of marketing organization, functional \nspecialists report to a chief marketing officer who coordinates their activities. Figure 1.5 shows seven \nspecialists. Other specialists might include a marketing planning manager, a market logistics manager, \na direct marketing manager, a social media manager, and a digital marketing manager.\nThe main advantage of a functional marketing organization is its administrative simplicity. \nHowever, it can be quite a challenge for the departments to develop smooth working relationships, \nwhich can result in inadequate planning as the number of products and markets increases and the \nfunctional groups vie for budget and status. The marketing vice president constantly weighs competing \nclaims and faces a difficult coordination problem.\nGeographic Organization.  A company selling in a national market often organizes its sales \nforce (and sometimes its marketing) along geographic lines. The national sales manager may supervise \nfour regional sales managers, who each supervise six zone managers, each of whom supervises eight \ndistrict sales managers, who supervise 10 salespeople apiece.\nSome companies are adding area market specialists  (regional or local marketing managers) to sup -\nport sales efforts in high-volume markets. To illustrate, consider how one such market might work in \nMiami\u2013Dade County, Florida, where almost two-thirds of households are Hispanic and Latinos. The \nMiami specialist would know Miami\u2019s customer and trade makeup, help marketing managers at head -\nquarters adjust their marketing mix for Miami, and prepare local annual and long-range plans for sell -\ning all the company\u2019s products there. Some companies must develop different marketing programs in \ndifferent parts of the country, because geography substantially alters their brand development activities.\nProduct or Brand Organization.  Companies producing a variety of products and brands \noften establish a product- or brand-management organization. This does not replace the functional \norganization but serves as another layer of management. A group product manager supervises product \ncategory managers, who in turn supervise specific product and brand managers.\nA product-management organization makes sense if the company\u2019s products are quite different \nor if there are more products than a functional organization can handle. This form is sometimes char -\nacterized as a hub-and-spoke system. The brand or product manager is figuratively at the center, with \nspokes leading to various departments representing working relationships (see Figure 1.6).\nA manager\u2019s functions involve developing a long-range and competitive strategy for the offering; \npreparing an annual marketing plan and sales forecast; working with advertising, digital, and merchan -\ndising agencies to develop copy, programs, and campaigns; managing support of the product among \nthe sales force and distributors; gathering continuous intelligence about the product\u2019s performance, \ncustomer and dealer attitudes, and new problems and opportunities; and initiating product improve -\nments to meet changing market needs.\nThe product-management organization lets the product manager concentrate on developing a \ncost-effective marketing program and react more quickly to new products in the marketplace; it also \nFIGURE 1.5 \nFunctional Organization\nMarket research\nmanagerProduct\nmanagerService\nmanager\nSales\nmanagerPublic relations\nmanagerBrand\nmanager\nCommunication\nmanagerChief Marketing Officer", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3822, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cf56453-05ca-401f-88bd-4ab9c363914e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cf56453-05ca-401f-88bd-4ab9c363914e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40376dc1-edab-4659-aa50-d2d2af33530e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "41f3602a541829a952fc297fbb545b50b5610d213c5631cc474e94d5ce0a0d2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5727f9a-d5b7-420d-9aa6-0b65e000dc62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "28237fff8bf19d90c7adb892c38cab6731102fefd91bedc4d0ea9f5ba89c41ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a06d7e33-00af-452a-b984-5ef0370264c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1adf991e193a8fe55b0294c612ad4374ce01f7a333bbee1361e65531d96f2433", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 1    |  DEFINING  MARKETING  FOR  ThE NEw REALITIES   19\ngives the company\u2019s smaller brands a product advocate. But it has disadvantages, too. Product and \nbrand managers may lack authority to carry out their responsibilities. They often become experts in \ntheir product area but rarely achieve functional expertise. Another challenge is that brand managers \nnormally manage a brand for only a short time. Short-term involvement leads to short-term plan -\nning and fails to build long-term strengths. The fragmentation of markets makes it harder to develop \na national strategy. Brand managers must please regional and local sales groups, transferring power \nfrom marketing to sales. Another important consideration is that product and brand managers focus \nthe company on building market share rather than customer relationships.\nThe product-management organization can be structured around the company\u2019s products or, \nalternatively, a company can focus on product categories to manage its brands. Procter & Gamble, a \npioneer of the brand-management system, and other top packaged-goods firms have made a major \nshift to category management, as have firms outside the grocery channel. Diageo\u2019s shift to category \nmanagement was seen as a means to better manage the development of premium brands. It also helped \nthe firm address the plight of under-performing brands.\nProcter & Gamble cited a number of advantages of its shift to category management. The tradi -\ntional brand-management system had created strong incentives to excel but also internal competition \nfor resources and a lack of coordination. The new scheme was designed to ensure adequate resources \nfor all categories. Another rationale for category management is the increasing power of the retail trade, \nwhich has thought of profitability in terms of product categories. P&G felt it only made sense to deal \nalong similar lines. Mass market retailers and regional grocery chains such as Walmart and Wegmans \nembrace category management as a means to define a particular product category\u2019s strategic role within \nthe store and to address logistics, the role of private-label products, and the trade-offs between product \nvariety and inefficient duplication.30 In fact, in some packaged-goods firms, category management \nhas evolved into aisle management and encompasses multiple related categories typically found in the \nsame sections of supermarkets and grocery stores. General Mills\u2019 Yoplait Yogurt has served as category \nadvisor to the dairy aisle for 24 major retailers, boosting the yogurt base footprint four to eight feet at \na time and increasing yogurt sales by 9 percent and dairy category sales by 13 percent nationwide.31\nMarket Organization.  Companies often develop diverse products and services to target distinct \ntarget markets. For example, Canon sells printers to consumer, business, and government markets. \nNippon Steel sells to the railroad, construction, and public utility industries. When customers fall into \ndifferent user groups with distinct buying preferences and practices, a market-management organiza -\ntion is desirable. Market managers supervise several market-development managers, market special -\nists, or industry specialists and draw on functional services as needed. Market managers of important \nmarkets might even have functional specialists reporting to them.FIGURE 1.6 \nThe Product Manager\u2019s Interactions\nProduct\ndesign\nCommunication\nDistribution\nSales\npromotionSales forceMarketing\nresearchCustomer\nserviceLegalR & D\nBrand/Product\nManager", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a06d7e33-00af-452a-b984-5ef0370264c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a06d7e33-00af-452a-b984-5ef0370264c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad309e15-ae5a-4bc5-9d01-4cd481e7ceed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "bde84d69c54adb23885d919709ba169e1080b91527a2f8f4b36dc6ad137bcfe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0cf56453-05ca-401f-88bd-4ab9c363914e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "1b44e580c9e46357d5b97b2d81e8776c912b130df03a0121f8bd32657159a98a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f0934f3-8307-45ef-809f-6c1aba2db587", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b2f1e657e0de476bf7972c47c36301541494f9baa6b6ed6274de0b34256fe08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "20 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nMarket managers are staff (not line) people, with duties like those of product managers. They \ndevelop long-range and annual plans for their markets and are judged by their market\u2019s growth and \nprofitability. Because this system organizes marketing activity to meet the needs of distinct customer \ngroups, it shares many of the advantages and disadvantages of product-management systems. Many \ncompanies are reorganizing along market lines and becoming market-centered organizations. Xerox \nconverted from geographic selling to selling by industry, as did IBM and Hewlett-Packard.\nWhen a close relationship is advantageous, such as when customers have diverse and complex \nrequirements and buy an integrated bundle of products and services, a customer-management orga -\nnization that deals with individual customers, rather than with the mass market or even market seg -\nments, should prevail.32 One study showed that companies organized by customer groups reported \nmuch higher accountability for the overall quality of relationships and greater employee freedom \nto take actions to satisfy individual customers.33\nMatrix Organization.  Companies that produce many products for many markets may adopt a \nmatrix structure employing both product and market managers. The rub is that this choice is costly \nand often creates conflicts. There\u2019s the cost of supporting all the managers and the issue of resolving \nquestions about where authority and responsibility for marketing activities should reside\u2014at head -\nquarters or in the division.34 Some corporate marketing groups assist top management with overall \nopportunity evaluation, provide divisions with consulting assistance on request, help divisions that \nhave little or no marketing, and promote the marketing concept throughout the company.\nMany companies have reengineered their work flows and have built cross-functional teams that \nare responsible for each process.35 AT&T, LexisNexis, and Pratt & Whitney have reorganized their \nemployees into cross-functional teams. Cross-functional teams operate in nonprofit and government \norganizations as well.36\nOne of the key disadvantages of the matrix structure is the potential lack of clear focus and \naccountability.\nMANAGING THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT\nAs David Packard of Hewlett-Packard observed, \u201cMarketing is far too important to leave to the mar -\nketing department\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In a truly great marketing organization, you can\u2019t tell who\u2019s in the marketing \ndepartment. Everyone in the organization has to make decisions based on the impact on the cus -\ntomer.\u201d Although marketing activities should not be relegated to a single department, many enter -\nprises can benefit from having an organizational unit that is in charge of all company marketing \nactivities and manages day-to-day operations.\nThe Role of the CEO and CMO.  Only a select group of companies have historically stood out \nas master marketers. These companies focus on the customer and are organized to respond effectively \nto changing needs. They all have well-staffed marketing departments, and their other departments \naccept that the customer is king. They also often have strong marketing leadership in the form of a \nsuccessful CEO and CMO.\nCEOs recognize that marketing builds strong brands and a loyal customer base, intangible assets \nthat contribute heavily to the value of a firm. Many firms, including service and nonprofit firms, now \nhave a chief marketing officer to put marketing on a more equal footing with other C-level executives \nsuch as the chief financial officer and the chief information officer.37\nWhat steps can a CEO take to create a market- and customer-focused company? To create a true \nmarketing organization, the CEO must convince senior management of the importance of being cus -\ntomer focused. It is also important that the CEO be able to hire strong marketing talent. Most compa -\nnies need a skilled chief marketing officer who not only manages the marketing department but also \nhas the respect of, and influence with, the other C-level executives.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of today\u2019s markets, the CEO must facilitate the creation of strong \nin-house marketing training programs to sharpen the company\u2019s marketing skills. Many companies, \nsuch as McDonald\u2019s, Unilever, and Accenture, have centralized training facilities to run such programs. \nThe CEO should also ensure that the company\u2019s reward system is aligned with its strategic goal of creat -\ning market value by developing a satisfied, loyal customer base. The CEO should personally exemplify \nstrong customer commitment and reward those in the organization who do likewise.38\nA major responsibility of the CEO is to appoint a chief marketing officer who is ultimately respon -\nsible for marketing activities in the organization.

The senior marketing managers responsible for various parts of the marketing \nstrategy typically report to the CMO. The CMO leads all marketing functions in the organization, \nincluding product development, brand management, communication, market research and data ana -\nlytics, sales, promotion, distribution management, pricing, and customer service.\nIn the 21st century, the advancement of digital, online, and mobile marketing has changed the \nrole of the CMO. To effectively manage the marketing functions of the organization, the CMO must \nalso be able to handle digital technologies. The challenge CMOs face is that success factors are many \nand varied. CMOs must have strong quantitative and qualitative skills; they must have an independent, \nentrepreneurial attitude but work closely with other departments; and they must capture the \u201cvoice\u201d \nof consumers yet have a keen bottom-line understanding of how marketing creates value. Two-thirds \nof top CMOs think return on marketing investment will be the primary measure of their effectiveness \nin the next decade.\nMarketing experts George Day and Robert Malcolm believe that three driving forces will change \nthe role of the CMO in the coming years: (1) predictable marketplace trends, (2) the changing role of the \nC-suite, and (3) uncertainty about the economy and organizational design. They identify five priorities \nfor any successful CMO: act as the visionary for the future of the company, build adaptive marketing \ncapabilities, win the war for marketing talent, tighten the alignment with sales, and take accountability \nfor returns on marketing spending.39\nPerhaps the most important role for any CMO is to infuse a customer perspective in business \ndecisions affecting any customer touch point  (where a customer directly or indirectly interacts with the \ncompany). Increasingly, these customer insights must have a global focus. As the leader of one top \nexecutive search firm has said, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s CMO will have to have global and international experi -\nence. You can do it without living abroad, .  . . but you have to get exposure to those markets. It opens \nyour eyes to new ways of doing business, increases cultural sensitivity and increases flexibility.\u201d40\nRelationships with Other Departments.  The firm\u2019s success depends not only on how \nwell each department performs its work, but also on how well the company coordinates departmen -\ntal activities to conduct core business processes . Under the marketing concept, all departments need \nto \u201cthink customer\u201d and work together to satisfy customer needs and expectations. Yet departments \ndefine company problems and goals from their own viewpoints, so conflicts of interest and com -\nmunication problems are unavoidable. The marketing vice president or the CMO must usually work \nthrough persuasion, rather than through authority, to coordinate the company\u2019s internal marketing \nactivities and coordinate marketing with finance, operations, and other company functions to serve \nthe customer.41\nMany companies now focus on key processes rather than on departments because departmental \norganization can be a barrier to smooth performance. They appoint process leaders who manage \ncross-disciplinary teams that include marketing and salespeople. Marketers thus may have a solid-line \nresponsibility to their teams and a dotted-line responsibility to the marketing department.42\nGiven the goal of providing positive customer experiences from start to finish, all areas of the \norganization need to work effectively together. In particular, because of the growing importance of \nunderstanding the needs of individual customers, marketers must work closely with the customer \ninsights and data analytics teams. Furthermore, to be able to reach consumers in an effective and \ncost-efficient manner, marketers must work closely with different communication agencies\u2014from \ntraditional advertising agencies to social media, publicity, and event-management companies. Finally, \nto be able to deliver the company\u2019s offerings to the right place at the right time, marketers must \nwork closely with a company\u2019s channel partners, both in the brick-and-mortar space and in the \ne-commerce space.\nBuilding a Customer-Oriented Organization\nCreating a superior customer experience has become a priority for companies in nearly every indus -\ntry.43 The proliferation of products, services, and brands; increased consumer knowledge about \nmarket offerings; and consumers\u2019 ability to influence public opinion about companies and their \nofferings\u2014all have underscored the importance of building a customer-oriented organization. Most \ncompanies now realize that the path to creating stakeholder value begins with re-envisioning the \norganization as focused on creating long-term customer value.44 In his letter to shareholders, Jeff \nBezos defines Amazon\u2019s customer-centricity as follows.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6863ecdb-608f-4258-88ca-9230a1814064": {"__data__": {"id_": "6863ecdb-608f-4258-88ca-9230a1814064", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05ad1103-1874-48da-98d7-6c9813d73f69", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "61b85e171ffeae56ad3b36af647f9765eaa1aedecbd120d36a71336bbf8db558", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f0934f3-8307-45ef-809f-6c1aba2db587", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "d611710efe114e4f3398b000dfb4d7feeb342c65831ee102500dd9791b55f387", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fb9fd09-6a53-4d3e-b859-e27030770caf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e69bd5d98f257a4945a83f10eae946eaaa62918f43ad89fc585d6a0d6293df93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "22 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nManagers who believe the customer is the company\u2019s only true \u201cprofit center\u201d consider the tra -\nditional organization chart in Figure 1.7(a)\u2014a pyramid with the president at the top, management in \nthe middle, and frontline people and customers at the bottom\u2014to be obsolete.45\nSuccessful marketing companies transform the traditional organization-hierarchy chart to look \nlike the chart in Figure 1.7(b). A company\u2019s top priority are customers; next in importance are the front -\nline people who meet, serve, and satisfy these customers; then come service managers, whose job is to \nsupport the frontline people so they can serve customers well; and finally, there is the top management, \nwhose job is to hire and support good service managers. The key to developing a customer-oriented \ncompany is that managers at every level must be personally engaged in understanding, meeting, and \nserving customers. Table 1.2 lists the main characteristics of a customer-centric organization.\nSome companies have been founded on a customer-focused business model, and customer advo -\ncacy has been their strategy\u2014and competitive advantage\u2014all along. With the rise of digital technolo -\ngies, increasingly informed consumers expect companies to do more than connect with, satisfy, and \neven delight them. They expect companies to listen  and respond  to them.\nTraditionally, marketers played the role of intermediary, charged with understanding custom -\ners\u2019 needs and transmitting their voice to various functional areas of the company.46 But in a net -\nworked enterprise, every  functional area can interact directly with customers. Marketing no longer \nhas sole ownership of customer interactions; it now must integrate all customer-involving processes \nso that customers see a single face and hear a single voice when they interact with the firm.47\nMany companies realize they\u2019re not yet really market and customer driven; rather, they are prod -\nuct and sales driven. Transforming into a true market-driven company requires (among other actions) \ndeveloping a company-wide passion for customers, organizing around customer segments instead of \nproducts, and understanding customers through qualitative and quantitative research.48\nAlthough it\u2019s necessary  to be customer oriented, it\u2019s not enough.  The organization must also be cre -\native.49 Companies today copy one another\u2019s advantages and strategies with increasing speed, making \ndifferentiation harder to achieve and lowering margins as firms become more alike. The best answer \nto this dilemma is to build capability in strategic innovation and imagination. This capability comes \nfrom assembling tools, processes, skills, and measures that let the firm generate more and better new \nideas than its competitors.50 To encourage such capability, companies should strive to put together \ninspiring work spaces that help stimulate new ideas and foster imagination.One advantage\u2014perhaps a somewhat subtle one\u2014of a customer-driven focus is that it aids \na certain type of proactivity. When we\u2019re at our best, we don\u2019t wait for external pressures. We \nare internally driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. \nWe lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to. We invent before we have \nto. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competi -\ntion. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements \nin customer experience\u2014importantly\u2014even in those areas where we are already the leader.\nFIGURE 1.7 \nTraditional \nOrganization versus \nModern Customer-\nOriented Company \nOrganization\n(b) Modern Customer-Oriented Organization Chart\nCUSTOMERSService managers(a) Traditional Organization Chart\nFrontline employeesTop\nmanage-\nment\nTop\nmanagement\nCUSTOMERSFrontline employeesService managers", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3908, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fb9fd09-6a53-4d3e-b859-e27030770caf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fb9fd09-6a53-4d3e-b859-e27030770caf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0dfb2788-251c-41b9-830d-11281faea7bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "dd3d10ae0748dd875c4c7bf5811cb0d1bdabbc8dcfb0a521feac94d1060a1b16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6863ecdb-608f-4258-88ca-9230a1814064", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "./data/Chap1.pdf"}, "hash": "61b85e171ffeae56ad3b36af647f9765eaa1aedecbd120d36a71336bbf8db558", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f97d9620-9cac-4034-bc94-08074032d262", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "055982d287ab3b80bd7a761924e87529aaf0a66371722334268b88f814e9267c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 1    |  DEFINING  MARKETING  FOR  ThE NEw REALITIES   23\nCompanies must be alert to trends and stand ready to capitalize on them.

Marketing is not conducted by the marketing depart -\nment alone. To create a strong marketing organization, \nmarketers must think like executives in other depart -\nments, and executives in other departments must think \nmore like marketers.\n9. A customer-centric company must be market driven \nrather than product driven, it must aim to cater to indi -\nvidual customer needs rather than mass market needs, \nand it must strive to make the competition irrelevant \nrather than merely reacting to competitors\u2019 actions. To \nsucceed, a company should focus on delivering superior \nvalue to target customers in a way that benefits the com -\npany and its collaborators.6. There are five competing concepts under which organiza -\ntions can choose to conduct their business: the produc -\ntion concept, the product concept, the selling concept, the \nmarketing concept, and the market-value concept. The \nmore sophisticated a company\u2019s understanding of the \nmarket, the more likely that it will adopt the market-value \nconcept as an overarching philosophy of doing business.\n7. Companies use different approaches to organize the \nmarketing department: functional, geographic, product/\nbrand, market, and a matrix structure. The choice of a \nparticular approach depends on the market in which a \ncompany operates, its organizational structure, and its \nstrategic goals.\nmarketing\nSPOTLIG hT\nconsumers clamored for the Air Jordan line of basketball shoes \nwith the distinctive Nike swoosh.

In 1988, Nike aired the first ads in its influential \n\u201cJust Do It\u201d ad campaign, which subtly challenged a genera-\ntion of athletic enthusiasts to chase their goals. The slogan \nwas a natural offshoot of Nike\u2019s attitude of self-empowerment \nthrough sports.\nwhile expanding overseas, Nike adapted its marketing \nto face new challenges. The company quickly learned that its \nU.S.-style ads were too aggressive for consumers in Europe, \nAsia, and South America and adjusted its tone. Furthermore, \nit needed to tailor its marketing for different countries so con-\nsumers would feel that the brand was authentic. To this end, \nNike focused on promoting soccer (called football outside \nthe United States), becoming an active supporter of youth \nleagues, local clubs, and national teams around the world. It \nalso searched for opportunities to sponsor soccer teams and \nleagues in an attempt to replicate the company\u2019s earlier suc-\ncess with U.S. sponsorships.\nIn the late 1990s, Nike moved into soccer in a big way. \nIt secured marketing rights for several major soccer federa-\ntions, including those in powerhouse countries like Brazil and \nItaly. It also started pouring money into marketing campaigns \nfocused on the world Cup. Nike\u2019s heavy investment in soccer \nhelped propel the brand\u2019s growth internationally as its image \nmorphed from that of a sneaker company into a brand that \nrepresented emotion, allegiance, and identification.

Every little magical detail \nmatters to Disney, right down to the custodial workers who are \ntrained by Disney\u2019s animators to take their broom and bucket \nof water and quietly \u201cpaint\u201d a Goofy or Mickey Mouse in water \non the pavement. It\u2019s a moment of magic for the guests that \nlasts just a minute before it evaporates in the hot sun.\nwith so many brands, characters, and businesses, Disney \nuses technology to ensure that a customer\u2019s experience is con -\nsistent across every platform. Disney connects with its consum -\ners in innovative ways through e-mail, blogs, and its website \nto provide insight into movie trailers, television clips, Broadway \nshows, and virtual theme park experiences. Disney was one of \nthe first companies to begin regular podcasts of its television \nshows and to release ongoing news about its products and \ninterviews with Disney\u2019s employees, staff, and park officials.

After walt\u2019s death, \nRoy Disney took over as CEO and realized his brother\u2019s dream \nof opening the 24,000-acre walt Disney world theme park in \nFlorida. Roy died in 1971, but the two brothers left behind a \nbrand that stood for trust, fun, and entertainment and resonated \nwith children, families, and adults, and some of the most mov -\ning and iconic characters, stories, and memories of all time.\nThe walt Disney Company stumbled for several years with -\nout the leadership of its two founding brothers. It wasn\u2019t until the \nlate 1980s that the company reconnected with its audience and \nrestored trust and interest in the Disney brand. It all started with the \nrelease of The Little Mermaid , which turned an old fairy tale into \na magical animated Broadway-style movie that won two Oscars. \nBetween the late 1980s and 2000, Disney entered an era known \nas the Disney Renaissance, as it released ground-breaking ani -\nmated films such as Beauty and the Beast  (1991), Aladdin  (1992), \nThe Lion King  (1994), Toy Story  (with Pixar, 1995), and Mulan  \n(1998). In addition, the company thought of creative new ways to \ntarget its core family-oriented consumers and expand into areas \nthat would reach an older audience. Disney launched the Disney \nChannel, Touchstone Pictures, and Touchstone Television. The \ncompany made its classic films available on The Disney Sunday \nNight Movie  and sold them on video at extremely low prices, \nreaching a whole new generation of children. Disney tapped into \npublishing, international theme parks, and theatrical productions \nthat helped reach a variety of audiences around the world.\nToday, Disney comprises four business units: (1)\u00a0 Media \nNetworks  encompasses a vast array of broadcast, cable, \nradio, publishing, and digital businesses across two \ndivisions\u2014the Disney/ABC Television Group and ESPN Inc. \n(2)\u00a0Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products  brings Disney\u2019s \nstories, characters, and franchises to life through parks and \nresorts, toys, apps, apparel, books, and stores.
