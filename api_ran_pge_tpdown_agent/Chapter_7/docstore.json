"text": "140 \nCHAPTER \n>>> T-Mobile was incorporated in the United States in 2004 as a mobile communications  subsidiary \nof the German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom. An important component of \nT-Mobile\u2019s phenomenal success was its strategic positioning against the two dominant  players in \nthe telecommunications market: AT&T and Verizon. This positioning was reflected not only in the \nway T-Mobile chose to define its brand\u2014 the \u201cUn-Carrier\u201d\u2014but also in the products and  services \nit offered to customers. The company eliminated long-term contracts, replacing them with a \n transparent pricing model. It also made it easier to upgrade to a new smart phone and got rid of \nglobal roaming charges, which were major sources of frustration for customers using rival wireless \nnetworks. T-Mobile made it easy to call free over Wi-Fi networks and stream video without incurring \nadditional charges. All of this was possible because T-Mobile kept investing in its wireless network, No company can win if its products and services resemble every other product and offering.  \nAs part of the strategic brand management process, each offering must represent the right kinds \nof things in the minds of the target market. Consider how T-Mobile has positioned its offerings to \nunderscore its distinct value proposition.Crafting a Customer Value \nProposition and Positioning7 \nT-Mobile\u2019s strategic \nrepositioning as \nthe \u201cUn-Carrier,\u201d \nits move to more \ncustomer-centric \nofferings, and con-\ntinual investment in \nits wireless network \nhave enabled it to \nsuccessfully com-\npete against rivals \nAT&T and Verizon.\nSource: Cheryl Fleishman/\nAlamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5cd4258-93cf-48e0-9128-74e3ba52987c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5cd4258-93cf-48e0-9128-74e3ba52987c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4feb36e4-57e5-4b87-86d6-9436897ef334", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "eddf8d0b59f9c6f4819c1609fbe9b0a2048e8d9174f7a5ae310fceb4670b82c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65d1dbe1-18b7-4dc5-8a8d-331a4d2894c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "11086a3eff795c050b1a97123208912ee47409876a64b19826beba7d22880a44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a746a98a-f8fd-414d-b0f7-2163578089e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c29a2eca0f72db13857891b5191c9629ecf2d8761ae439caa3d34db347e373b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "141\nPART 3   |  DEVELOPING A VIABLE MARKET STRATEGY\n7.1  Explain how a company should develop a value \nproposition and a positioning strategy.\n7.2  Describe how a company chooses a frame \nof\u00a0reference.\n7.3  Discuss how a company identifies points \nof\u00a0parity and points of difference.7.4  Define the key strategies for creating a \nsustainable competitive advantage.\n7.5  Identify alternative strategies to communicate  \nthe positioning of a company\u2019s offerings.creating quality and reliability that matched that of AT&T and Verizon and aiming for a customer  \nservice experience superior to that of its rivals. To promote its competitive advantage, T-Mobile \nzeroed in on AT&T, observing that many customers felt AT&T, which had exclusive rights to the iPhone \nwhen it was launched, had taken advantage of that by overpricing its calling plans while offering poor \ncustomer service. The direct attack on AT&T focused on T-Mobile\u2019s four main points of difference: \ntechnological innovation, low and transparent pricing, great service, and its \u201ccoolness\u201d as the choice \nof the millennial consumers. The strategic investment in developing customer-centric offerings, the \ncompetitive positioning of its brand, and the merger with Sprint in 2020, enabled T-Mobile to become \nthe second largest wireless carrier in the United States, with over 100 million customers.1\nAs the success of T-Mobile demonstrates, a company can reap the benefits of carving out a unique \nposition in the marketplace. Creating a compelling, well-differentiated brand position requires a keen \nunderstanding of consumer needs and wants, company capabilities, and competitive actions. It also \nrequires disciplined but creative thinking. In this chapter, we outline a process by which marketers can \ndiscover the most powerful brand positioning.\nDeveloping a Value Proposition \nand\u00a0Positioning\nA key aspect of marketing strategy is developing a value proposition and positioning a company\u2019s \noffering to target customers. A company discovers different needs and groups of consumers in the \nmarketplace, targets those it can satisfy in a superior way, and then develops a value proposition and \npositions its offerings so the target customers recognize the distinctive benefits of its offerings. By \nclearly articulating its value proposition and positioning, companies can deliver high customer value \nand satisfaction, which lead to high repeat purchases and ultimately to greater company profitability.\nDEVELOPING A VALUE PROPOSITION\nHow do customers ultimately make choices?

Psychological value extends beyond the functional benefits to create emotional benefits \nfor target customers. For example, customers might value the emotional benefits they derive from \na car (e.g., the joy of driving a high-performance automobile and the social status and lifestyle its \nownership conveys). Psychological value is of primary importance in luxury and fashion catego -\nries, where customers actively seek emotional and self-expressive benefits.\n\u2022 Monetary value  includes the financial benefits and costs associated with the offering.  Offering \nattributes that create monetary value include price, fees, discounts, and rebates, along with various \nmonetary costs associated with using and disposing of the offering. Although monetary value is \ntypically associated with costs, an offering can also include such monetary benefits as monetary \nbonuses, cash-back offers, cash prizes, financial rewards, and low-interest financing. Monetary \nvalue is often the prevailing choice criterion for undifferentiated offerings in commoditized \ncategories.\nAcross all three dimensions\u2014functional, psychological, and monetary\u2014customer value is the \ndifference between the prospective customer\u2019s evaluation of all the benefits and costs of an offering and \nher or his evaluation of the costs and benefits of the perceived alternatives. Total customer benefit  is \nthe perceived value of the bundle of functional, psychological, and monetary benefits customers expect \nfrom a given market offering because of the product, service, and image. Total customer cost  is the \nperceived bundle of functional, psychological, and monetary costs customers will incur in evaluating, \nobtaining, using, and disposing of the given market offering.\nThe customer value proposition  is based on the difference between benefits the customer gets \nand the costs he or she assumes for different choices. The marketer can increase the value of the offering \nby raising functional, psychological, and monetary benefits and/or reducing the corresponding costs.\nThe value proposition consists of the whole cluster of benefits the company promises to deliver; it \nis more than the core positioning of the offering. For example, Volvo\u2019s core positioning has been \u201csafety,\u201d \nbut the buyer is promised more than just a safe car. Other benefits include good performance, good \ndesign, and concern for the environment. The value proposition is thus a promise about the  experience \nthat customers can expect from the company\u2019s market offering and their relationship with the supplier. \nWhether the promise is kept depends on the company\u2019s ability to manage its value delivery system.\nVery often, managers conduct a customer value analysis  to reveal the company\u2019s strengths and \nweaknesses relative to those of various competitors. The steps in this analysis are as follows:\n1. Identify the relevant attributes and benefits that customers value.  Customers are asked \nwhat attributes, benefits, and performance levels they look for in choosing a product and \n vendors. Attributes and benefits should be defined broadly to encompass all the inputs to cus -\ntomers\u2019 decisions.3\n2. Assess the relative importance of these attributes and benefits.  Customers are asked to \nrate the importance of different attributes and benefits. If their ratings diverge too much, the \nmarketer should cluster the attributes and benefits into different segments.\n3. Assess the company\u2019s and competitors\u2019 performance on the key attributes/benefits.  If \nthe company\u2019s offer exceeds the competitor\u2019s offer on all important attributes and benefits, the \ncompany can charge a higher price and thereby earning higher profits, or it can charge the same \nprice and thereby gain more market share.\n4. Monitor customer value over time.  The company must periodically redo its studies of \n customer values and competitors\u2019 standings as the economy, technology, and product features \nchange.\nCustomer value analysis suggests that the seller must assess the total customer benefit and total \ncustomer cost associated with each competitor\u2019s offer in order to know how its own offer rates in \nthe buyer\u2019s mind. It also implies that the seller at a disadvantage has two alternatives: increase total \ncustomer benefit or decrease total customer cost. The former calls for strengthening or augmenting \nthe functional, psychological, and monetary benefits of the offering\u2019s product, services, and brand \nimage. The latter calls for reducing the buyer\u2019s costs by reducing the price or cost of ownership and \nmaintenance, simplifying the ordering and delivery process, or absorbing some buyer risk by offering \na warranty.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5065, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae1e517e-840a-412c-a51c-91c3911fe13b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae1e517e-840a-412c-a51c-91c3911fe13b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40a8e490-221b-4abd-b0c2-50469d8126a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "24f6beca04f52a54ef4048b3a476ceb6c62f30de7c1853c3a5b4dc7456173715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a746a98a-f8fd-414d-b0f7-2163578089e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "2c21c65e29b23c55bfd6853c94e73c2e0b4aae1482fdc63e9863c180d1e0af2e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d625d540-f184-4276-9df0-669ea151c2ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b879899815fcee3ecf6a5ad7bd02dec57e420739f907966af9a54ee97e3ffaf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 7    |  CRAFTING  A CUSTOMER  VALUE  PROPOSITION  AND  POSITIONING  143\nDEVELOPING A POSITIONING STRATEGY\nPositioning  is the act of designing a company\u2019s offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the \nminds of the target market.4 The goal is to instill the brand in the minds of consumers to maximize the \npotential benefit to the firm. Unlike the value proposition, which articulates all benefits and costs of \nthe offering, the positioning zeroes in on the key benefits that will provide consumers with a reason \nto choose the company\u2019s offering.\nEffective positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying the brand\u2019s essence, identify -\ning the goals it helps the consumer achieve, and showing how it does so in a unique way. Everyone \nin the organization should understand the brand positioning and use it as the context for making \ndecisions.\nMany marketing experts believe positioning should have both rational and emotional  components. \nIn other words, it should appeal to both the head and the heart.5 Companies often seek to build on their \nperformance advantages to strike an emotional chord with customers. When research on the scar-\ntreatment product Mederma found that women were buying it not just for the physical treatment but \nalso to increase their self-esteem, the marketers of the brand added emotional messaging to what had \ntraditionally been a practical message that stressed physician recommendations: \u201cWhat we have done \nis supplement the rational with the emotional.\u201d6 Kate Spade is another brand that blends functional \nand emotional in its positioning.\nKate Spade  Although only a little more than 25 years old, Kate Spade has evolved from \na bags-only brand to a much more diversified fashion brand. Launched by husband-and-wife \nteam Kate and Andy Spade\u2014who later sold their stake\u2014the brand was initially known for a \ntiny, minimalist-looking black bag.

Kate Spade has made a strong e-commerce push to complement \nits 200-plus stores, with 20 percent of sales coming from online channels.

If, in some marketing activity\u2014an ad campaign, a social media communication, a new prod -\nuct  introduction\u2014the brand were replaced by a competitive brand, then that marketing activity \nshould not work as well in the marketplace. For example, would Kate Spade\u2019s positioning work for its \n competitors\u2014Tory Birch, Coach, or Cole Haan? If the answer is yes, this means that the Kate Spade \nbrand has not developed a distinct positioning in the market.\nA well-positioned brand should be distinctive in its meaning and execution. If a sport or music \nsponsorship, for example, would work as well if it were for a leading competitor, then either the posi -\ntioning is not sharply enough defined or the sponsorship as executed does not tie closely enough to \nthe brand positioning.\nA good positioning has one foot in the present and one in the future. It needs to be somewhat \naspirational so that the brand has room to grow and improve. Positioning on the basis of the current \nstate of the market is not sufficiently forward-looking, but at the same time the positioning cannot be \nso removed from reality that it is essentially unobtainable. The real trick is to strike just the right bal -\nance between what the brand is and what it could be.\nPositioning requires that marketers define and communicate similarities and differences between \ntheir brand and its competitors. Specifically, deciding on a positioning involves\n1. Choosing a frame of reference by identifying the target market and relevant competition\n2. Identifying the optimal points of parity and points of difference given that frame of reference\nThese two aspects of positioning are discussed in more detail in the following sections.\nChoosing a Frame of Reference\nConsumers determine the value of an offering relative to a reference point used to assess its benefits \nand costs. An offering can be viewed as attractive in comparison to an inferior offering, but the same \noffering can be perceived as unattractive when compared to a superior offering. Therefore, a frame \nof reference  can serve as a benchmark against which customers can evaluate the benefits of a com -\npany\u2019s offering.\nGiven the fact that consumers naturally construct frames of reference to evaluate the available \noptions, a skilled marketer can design these frames of reference in a way that highlights the value of the \noffering. Decisions about the frame of reference are closely linked to target market decisions. Deciding \nto target a certain type of consumer can define the nature of competition, either because certain firms \nhave decided to target that segment in the past (or plan to do so in the future) or because consumers in \nthat segment may already look to certain products or brands in their purchase decisions.\nA good starting point in defining a competitive frame of reference for brand positioning is category \nmembership \u2014the products or sets of products with which a brand competes and that function as close \nsubstitutes. It would seem a simple task for a company to identify its competitors. PepsiCo knows \n Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani is a major bottled-water competitor for its Aquafina brand; Wells Fargo knows \nBank of America is a major banking competitor; and Petsmart.com knows a major online retail com -\npetitor for pet food and supplies is Petco.com.\nThe range of a company\u2019s actual and potential competitors, however, can be more extensive than \nthe obvious ones. To enter new markets, a brand with growth intentions may need a broader\u2014or \nmaybe even a more aspirational\u2014competitive frame. Furthermore, the brand may be more likely to \nbe hurt by emerging competitors or new technologies than by current competitors.\nThe energy-bar market created by PowerBar ultimately fragmented into a variety of subcategories, \nincluding some directed at specific segments (such as Luna bars for women) and some possessing spe -\ncific attributes (such as the protein-laden Balance and the calorie-control bar Pria). Each represented \na subcategory for which the original PowerBar may not be as relevant.8\nFirms should choose their competitive frame to evoke more advantageous comparisons.

In dynamic categories where competition may exist or arise in a \nvariety of different forms, multiple frames of reference may be present.\nIdentifying Potential Points of Difference \nand Points of Parity\nOnce marketers have fixed the frame of reference for positioning by defining the customer market \nand the nature of the competition, they can define the appropriate points of difference (attributes or \nbenefits that are unique to the company\u2019s offering) and points of parity (attributes or benefits that \nthe company\u2019s offering has in common with the competition).10 We discuss points-of-parity and \npoints-of-difference associations in the following sections.\nIDENTIFYING POINTS OF DIFFERENCE\nPoints of difference (PODs)  are attributes or benefits that differentiate the company\u2019s offering from \nthe competition. These are attributes or benefits that consumers strongly associate with a brand, \nthat they positively evaluate, and that they believe could not be found to the same extent with a \n competitive brand.\nAssociations that make up points of difference can be based on virtually any type of attribute or \nbenefit.11 Louis Vuitton may seek a point of difference as having the most stylish handbags, Energizer \nas having the longest-lasting battery, and Fidelity Investments as offering the best financial advice and \nplanning.\nSuccessfully establishing meaningful points of difference can provide financial payoffs. As part of \nits IPO, the UK mobile phone operator O2 was rebranded from British Telecom\u2019s struggling BT Cellnet, \nbased on a powerful emotional campaign about freedom and enablement. When customer acquisi -\ntion, loyalty, and average revenue soared, the business was quickly acquired by Spanish multinational \nTelefonica for more than three times its IPO price.12\nAn increasingly important aspect of differentiation is brand authenticity\u2014the extent to which \nconsumers perceive a brand to be faithful to its essence and its reason for being.13 Brands such as \n Hershey\u2019s, Kraft, Crayola, Kellogg\u2019s, and Johnson & Johnson that are seen as authentic and genuine can \nevoke trust, affection, and strong loyalty. Welch\u2019s\u2014owned by the National Grape Cooperative, which is \nmade up of 1,150 Concord and Niagara grape farmers\u2014is seen by consumers as \u201cwholesome, authen -\ntic and real.\u201d The brand reinforces those credentials by focusing on its local sourcing of ingredients, \nan attribute that is increasingly important for consumers who want to know where their foods come \nfrom\u00a0and how they were made.14\nStrong brands often have multiple points of difference. Some examples are Apple ( design, ease of \nuse, and irreverent attitude ), Nike ( performance, innovative technology , and winning ), and Southwest Airlines \n(value, reliability , and fun personality ).\nCreating strong, favorable, and unique associations is a real challenge, but it is essential for compet -\nitive brand positioning.

Some key considerations follow.\n\u2022 Desirable to consumer.  Consumers must see the brand association as personally relevant to \nthem. Select Comfort made a splash in the mattress industry with its Sleep Number beds, which \nallow consumers to adjust the support and fit of the mattress for optimal comfort with a simple \nnumbering index. Consumers must also be given a compelling reason to believe and an under -\nstandable rationale for why the brand can deliver the desired benefit. Mountain Dew may argue \nthat it is more energizing than other soft drinks and support this claim by noting that it has a \nhigher level of caffeine. Chanel No. 5 perfume may claim to be the quintessentially elegant French \nperfume and support this claim by noting the long association between Chanel and haute  couture. \nSubstantiators can also come in the form of patented, branded ingredients, such as NIVEA  Wrinkle \nControl Cr\u00e8me with coenzyme Q10.\n\u2022 Deliverable by the company.  The company must have the internal resources and commitment \nto feasibly and profitably create and maintain the brand association in the minds of consumers. \nThe product design and the way the product is marketed must support the desired association. \nDoes communicating the desired association require actual changes to the product itself or just \nperceptual shifts in the way the consumer thinks of the product or brand? Creating the latter is \ntypically easier. General Motors has had to work to overcome public perceptions that Cadillac is \nnot a youthful, modern brand and has done so through bold designs, solid craftsmanship, and \nactive, contemporary images. The ideal brand association is preemptive, defensible, and difficult \nto attack. It is generally easier for market leaders such as ADM, Visa, and SAP to sustain their \npositioning, based as it is on demonstrable product or service performance, than it is for market \nleaders such as Fendi, Prada, and Herm\u00e8s, whose positioning is based on fashion and thus subject \nto the whims of a more fickle market.\n\u2022 Differentiating from competitors.  Finally, consumers must see the brand association as \ndistinctive and superior to relevant competitors. Splenda sugar substitute overtook Equal and \nSweet\u2019N Low to become the leader in its category by differentiating itself as a product derived \nfrom sugar without the associated drawbacks of an artificial low-calorie sweetener. In the crowded \nenergy-drink category, Monster has become a nearly $2 billion brand, and a threat to category \npioneer Red Bull, by differentiating itself on its innovative 16-ounce can and an extensive line of \nproducts targeting nearly every need state related to energy consumption.16\nIDENTIFYING POINTS OF PARITY\nPoints of parity (POPs) , on the other hand, are attribute or benefit associations that are not neces -\nsarily unique to the brand but may in fact be shared with other brands.17 These types of associations \ncome in three basic forms: category, correlational, and competitive.and labor practices to material reduction and the \nuse of nontoxic materials.

In other words, they represent \nnecessary\u2014but not sufficient\u2014conditions for brand choice. Consumers may not consider a travel \nagency truly a travel agency unless it is able to make air and hotel reservations, provide advice about \nleisure packages, and offer various ticket payment and delivery options. Category points of parity \nmay change over time because of technological advances, legal developments, or consumer trends, \nbut to use a golfing analogy, they are the \u201cgreens fees\u201d necessary to play the marketing game.\n\u2022 Correlational points of parity  are potentially negative associations that arise from the exis -\ntence of positive associations for the brand. One challenge for marketers is that many attributes \nor benefits that make up their POPs or PODs are inversely related. In other words, if your brand \nis good at one thing, such as being inexpensive, consumers can\u2019t see it as also good at something \nelse, like being \u201cof the highest quality.\u201d Consumer research into the trade-offs consumers make in \ntheir purchasing decisions can be informative here.\n\u2022 Competitive points of parity  are associations designed to overcome perceived weaknesses of \nthe brand in light of competitors\u2019 points of difference. One way to uncover key competitive points \nof parity is to role-play competitors\u2019 positioning and infer their intended points of difference. \nCompetitor\u2019s PODs will, in turn, suggest the brand\u2019s POPs.\nRegardless of the source of perceived weaknesses, if, in the eyes of consumers, a brand can \u201cbreak \neven\u201d in those areas where it appears to be at a disadvantage and achieve advantages in other areas, it \nshould be in a strong\u2014and perhaps unbeatable\u2014competitive position. Consider the introduction of \nMiller Lite beer, the first major light beer in North America.\nMiller Lite  The initial advertising strategy for Miller Lite beer had two goals: ensuring parity \nwith key competitors in the regular, full-strength beer category by stating that Miller Lite \u201ctastes \ngreat,\u201d while at the same time creating a point of difference around the fact that it contained \none-third fewer calories and was thus \u201cless filling.\u201d As often happens, the point of parity and \npoint of difference were somewhat conflicting because consumers tend to equate taste with \ncalories. To overcome potential resistance, Miller employed credible spokespeople, primarily \npopular former professional athletes, who would presumably not drink a beer unless it tasted \ngood. These ex-jocks humorously debated which of the two product benefits\u2014\u201ctastes great\u201d or \n\u201cless filling\u201d\u2014was more descriptive of the beer. The ads ended with the clever tagline \u201cEverything \nYou\u2019ve Always Wanted in a Beer\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and Less.\u201d As time went on, the brand positioning evolved \nto encompass \u201cMiller Time\u201d in its advertising, an emotional appeal about the brand\u2019s \u201csociability\u201d \nand capacity to serve as a catalyst for good times with friends.18\nFor an offering to achieve parity on a particular attribute or benefit, a sufficient number of con -\nsumers must believe the brand is \u201cgood enough\u201d on that dimension. There is a zone or range of tol -\nerance or acceptance with points of parity. The brand does not literally need to be seen as equal to \ncompetitors, but consumers must feel it does well enough on that particular attribute or benefit. If they \ndo, they may be willing to base their evaluations and decisions on other factors more favorable to the \nbrand. A light beer presumably would never taste as good as a full-strength beer, but it would need to \ntaste close enough to be able to effectively compete.\nOften, the key to positioning is not so much achieving a point of difference as achieving points of \nparity!

For example, Starbucks \ncould define very distinct sets of competitors, suggesting different possible POPs and PODs as a result:20\nQuick-serve restaurants and convenience shops (McDonald\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts)\u2014 Intended PODs might \nbe quality, image, experience, and variety; intended POPs might be convenience and value.\nHome and office consumption (Folgers, NESCAF\u00c9 instant, and Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups)\u2014 Intended \nPODs might be quality, image, experience, variety, and freshness; intended POPs might be con -\nvenience and value.\nLocal caf\u00e9s\u2014 Intended PODs might be convenience and service quality; intended POPs might be \nproduct quality, variety, price, and community.\nNote that some potential POPs and PODs for Starbucks are shared across competitors; others are \nunique to a particular competitor.\nUnder such circumstances, marketers have to decide what to do. There are two main options with \nmultiple frames of reference. One is to first develop the best possible positioning for each type or class \nof competitors and then see whether there is a way to create one combined positioning robust enough \nto effectively address them all. If competition is too diverse, however, it may be necessary to prioritize \ncompetitors and then choose the most important set of competitors to serve as the competitive frame. \nOne crucial consideration is not to try to be all things to all people; this leads to \u201clowest common \ndenominator\u201d positioning, which is typically ineffective.21\nFinally, if there are many competitors in different categories or subcategories, it may be useful \nto develop the positioning either at the category level for all relevant categories (\u201cquick-serve restau -\nrants\u201d or \u201csupermarket take-home coffee\u201d for Starbucks) or with an exemplar from each category \n( McDonald\u2019s or NESCAF\u00c9 for Starbucks).\nOccasionally, a company will be able to straddle  two frames of reference with one set of points of \ndifference and points of parity. In these cases, the points of difference for one category become points \nof parity for the other, and vice versa. Subway restaurants are positioned as offering healthy, good-\ntasting sandwiches. This positioning allows the brand to create a POP on taste and a POD on health \nwith respect to quick-serve restaurants such as McDonald\u2019s and Burger King and, at the same time, to \ncreate a POP on health and a POD on taste with respect to health food restaurants and caf\u00e9s!\nStraddle positions allow brands to expand their market coverage and potential customer base. \nOne example of such straddle positioning is BMW.>> While Visa strives \nto match the prestige \nof competitor American \nExpress by offering gold \nand platinum cards, \nAmerican Express is \naiming to extend the \nreach of its card to erase \nVisa\u2019s advantage as the \nmost widely available \ncredit card.\nSource: Oliver Hoffmann/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3175, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75c1d9da-575b-4057-9792-b230e4e388b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "75c1d9da-575b-4057-9792-b230e4e388b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03e67483-4f94-464c-9a16-84ed0a443093", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "db619c890f1616be05fe1736b1ad1acadc90d99de8d066829359c2533fcfec06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ac60843-8626-4d21-8a8d-212d11e4399d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "fb15e82e4a861b4e99bbae00fffe947c959091f479c46ce314866dc26f8c88fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e60799f0-faac-4dce-bfa9-07ead9a20cd9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ccc876e6b8ae36babb00bccd8e963f0d5beb6d1c63eb01c912158eedf85ce90d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 7    |  CRAFTING  A CUSTOMER  VALUE  PROPOSITION  AND  POSITIONING  149\nBMW  When BMW first made a strong competitive push into the U.S. market in the late 1970s, \nit positioned the brand as the only automobile that offered both luxury and performance. At that \ntime, consumers saw U.S. luxury cars as lacking performance and U.S. performance cars as \nlacking luxury. By relying on the design of its cars, its German heritage, and other aspects of a  \nwell-conceived marketing program, BMW was able to simultaneously achieve: (1) a point of \ndifference on luxury and a point of parity on performance with respect to U.S. performance cars \nlike the Chevy Corvette and (2) a point of difference on performance and a point of parity on \nluxury with respect to U.S. luxury cars like Cadillac.

If the \npoints of parity and points of difference are not credible, the brand may not be viewed as a legitimate \nplayer in either category. Many early personal digital assistants (palm-sized computers) such as the \nPalm Pilot and Apple\u2019s Newton, which unsuccessfully tried to straddle categories ranging from pagers \nto laptop computers, provide a vivid illustration of this risk.\nOften a good positioning will have several PODs and POPs. Of those, two or three often really \ndefine the competitive battlefield and should be analyzed and developed carefully. A good positioning \nshould also follow the \u201c80\u201320\u201d rule and be highly applicable to 80 percent of the products carrying the \nbrand. Attempting to position based on 100 percent of a brand\u2019s products often yields an unsatisfac -\ntory, \u201clowest common denominator\u201d result.

Perceptual maps  are visual representations of consumer percep -\ntions and preferences.

Pharmaceutical companies are developing biologics\u2014  medicines \nproduced by using the body\u2019s own cells rather than through chemical reactions in a lab\u2014because it is dif -\nficult for copycat pharmaceutical companies to make generic versions of biologics when they go off patent. \nRoche Holding will enjoy an advantage of at least three years with its $7-billion-a-year-in-sales biologic \nrheumatoid arthritis treatment Rituxan before a biosimilar copycat version is introduced.25\nFew competitive advantages are inherently sustainable; in the long run, they are often replicated \nby the competition. Instead, a competitive advantage may be leverageable. A leverageable advantage  is \none that a company can use as a springboard to new advantages, much as Microsoft has leveraged \nits operating system with Microsoft Office and networking applications. In general, a company that \nhopes to endure must be in the business of continuously inventing new advantages that can serve as \nthe basis of points of difference.\nAny product or service benefit that is sufficiently desirable, deliverable, and differentiating can \nserve as a point of difference for a brand. The obvious, and often the most compelling, means of dif -\nferentiation for consumers are benefits related to performance. Swatch offers colorful, fashionable \nwatches; GEICO offers reliable insurance at discount prices.\nGEICO  GEICO has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on TV advertising. Has it been worth it?  \nWarren Buffet, chairman and CEO of GEICO\u2019s parent company Berkshire Hathaway, thinks so. \nGEICO became the fastest-growing auto insurance company in the United States by selling \ndirectly to consumers with a basic message: \u201c15 Minutes Could Save You 15% or More on Your \nCar Insurance.\u201d Partnering with The Martin Agency, GEICO has run a series of highly creative and \naward-winning ad campaigns to emphasize different aspects of the brand. TV ads featuring the \nCockney-speaking Gecko lizard spokes-character reinforce GEICO\u2019s brand image as credible and \naccomplished. The \u201cHappier Than\u201d campaign comes up with exaggerated situations to describe how \nhappy GEICO customers are, such as a camel on Wednesday (hump day) and Dracula volunteering \nat a blood drive. A third campaign featuring Maxwell, a talking pig, focuses on specific products and \nservice features. The fourth campaign, \u201cDid You Know,\u201d starts with a person commenting on the \ncompany\u2019s famous 15-minute slogan to a companion, who replies, \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d The first \nspeaker then tries to save face with a twist on some other conventional wisdom, such as Pinocchio \nwas a poor motivational speaker or Old McDonald was a really bad speller. The multiple campaigns \ncomplement each other and build on one another\u2019s success. The company dominates the TV \nairwaves with so many varied car insurance messages that competitors\u2019 ads are lost.26\nSometimes changes in the marketing environment can open up new opportunities to create a means \nof differentiation. Eight years after it launched Sierra Mist, when sales began stagnating, PepsiCo tapped \ninto rising consumer interest in natural and organic products to reposition the lemon-lime soft drink as all-\nnatural with only five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, natural flavor, and potassium citrate.\nOften a brand\u2019s positioning transcends its performance considerations. Companies can fashion \ncompelling images that appeal to consumers\u2019 social and psychological needs. The primary explanation \nfor Marlboro\u2019s extraordinary worldwide market share (about 30 percent) is that its \u201cmacho cowboy\u201d \nimage struck a responsive chord with much of the cigarette-smoking public. Wine and liquor companies \nalso work hard to develop distinctive images for their brands. Even a seller\u2019s physical space can be a pow -\nerful image generator.

This is the quintessential strategy for creating an \nadvantage over competitors. Gillette has differentiated itself from competitors by stressing the quality \nof its shave. Online shaving supplies retailer Dollar Shave Club stresses price as its competitive advan -\ntage over premium brands such as Gillette. Zappos differentiates itself from other online shoe retailers \nby the level of customer service it provides. BMW uses the driving experience delivered by its vehicles \nas a point of differentiation from the competition. Volvo differentiates itself by focusing on safety, while \nRolls-Royce sets itself apart by emphasizing luxury.\nDifferentiating on an attribute that is meaningful to customers is the most intuitive way to cre -\nate a competitive advantage. However, it is often difficult to achieve, because offerings in a product \ncategory start to become more similar as their overall performance improves. Television sets are a \ngood example: As technical advancements have improved the overall quality of television sets, dif -\nferences among the available options have become less apparent to consumers, who perceive TVs as \nsimilar to one another.\nIntroduce a New Attribute.  In lieu of enhancing an offering\u2019s performance on an existing attri -\nbute, a company can distinguish its offering by introducing a new attribute\u2014one that competitors don\u2019t \nhave. examples abound: TOMS chose to differentiate itself from traditional shoe manufacturers by its \n\u201cbuy one, give one\u201d social responsibility program. PepsiCo used only all-natural ingredients to differenti -\nate its lemon-lime soft drink Sierra Mist from other soft drinks. Dollar Shave Club chose to set itself apart \nthrough subscription-based, direct-to-consumer shipping of shaving supplies. Uber streamlined the mon -\netary transaction between riders and drivers by introducing cash-free payment. And Nest incorporated \nmachine learning into its thermostats as an alternative approach to controlling the temperature in a home.\nIt is noteworthy that introducing a new attribute does not necessarily involve the invention of a \ncompletely innovative attribute. It can also involve tweaking an existing attribute that has been more or \nless neglected by competitors to transform it into a point of difference. Method Products, manufacturer \nof household cleaning products, did just that when it designed aesthetically pleasing packaging as a \ndistinguishing attribute in a category in which packaging was viewed as a purely functional attribute. In \nthe same vein, Apple introduced design as a key point of difference in the personal computer category \nwhen it came out with the egg-shaped, multi-colored iMac encased in translucent plastic.\nAlthough the introduction of a new attribute can offer a powerful advantage to a company, such \na move is rarely sustainable. Competitors will lose no time copying a new attribute that is valued by \ncustomers, thus greatly diminishing the competitive advantage of the company that pioneered the \nattribute. Creating a sustainable competitive advantage requires that a company constantly find fresh \nand unique ways of creating customer value.\nBuild a Strong Brand.  A valuable source of sustainable competitive advantage is a powerful \nbrand that gives customers a reason to choose the company\u2019s offering.

Taste is not what sets Coca-Cola apart from other cola drinks; rather, it is \nCoke\u2019s brand image, which has transcended national borders and cultural barriers to become known \nby almost everyone on the planet.\nDifferentiation through brand power is of particular value in commoditized product categories \nsuch as cereal, soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Grey Goose, for example, has successfully posi -\ntioned its product as the World\u2019s Best Tasting Vodka, which allows the company to command a sig -\nnificant price premium compared to many competitive brands. The success Grey Goose has had in \nachieving this distinction is especially notable because vodka is effectively a commodity, designed as \na \u201cneutral spirit\u201d that has no \u201cdistinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.\u201d28 Because most customers \ncannot tell taste the difference among different premium vodkas, the Grey Goose brand is obviously \nthe factor driving its purchase.\nIn addition to being viewed as an attribute of the company\u2019s offering, brand also has a singular role \nin creating a competitive advantage: It influences perceptions of the offering on such dimensions as \nquality, reliability, and durability\u2014dimensions that are not readily visible to customers. Thus, brands \ncan infuse the company\u2019s offering with a unique and meaningful message that resonates beyond the \nactual characteristics of the company\u2019s product and service and creates added value for customers. In \nother words, customers are buying not just Harley-Davidson, Coca-Cola, and Warby Parker products; \nthey are buying the meaning implied by these brands.\nBrands also have another facet. Besides influencing customer beliefs about the offering, a strong \nbrand can actually drive customer behavior when it is the first option that pops into a customer\u2019s mind \nas a way to fulfill a given need. For instance, Budweiser consistently promotes its product so that when \nits customers think of beer, \u201cBud\u201d is the first brand that comes to mind. GEICO is another company that \nspends tens of millions of dollars each year to ensure that drivers think of GEICO first when they con -\nsider car insurance. McDonald\u2019s aims to be the first fast-food restaurant that comes to customers\u2019 minds, \nedging out competitors Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, and Taco Bell. Tylenol, Advil, and Aleve have gained top-\nof-mind awareness in the category of non-prescription pain-relief, which allows these brands to sustain \ntheir market leadership in a product category filled with functionally identical low-priced generics.\nTop-of-mind brand awareness also creates a competitive advantage in that the brand considered \nfirst often becomes a reference point for consumers, the default option against which the other brands \nare evaluated. This is an important benefit, because unless they are given a strong reason to choose an \nalternative option, buyers are likely to select the default option.\nCommunicating the Offering\u2019s Positioning\nOnce they have fashioned the brand positioning strategy, marketers should communicate it to everyone \nin the organization so that it will guide their words and actions. This is usually achieved by developing a \npositioning statement . The key aspects of crafting an effective positioning statement\u2014  communicating \nan offering\u2019s category membership along with points of parity and points of difference, and developing \na narrative to convey the offering\u2019s positioning\u2014are discussed in the following sections.\nCRAFTING A POSITIONING STATEMENT\nA positioning statement clearly articulates the offering\u2019s target customers and the key benefit that will \nprovide customers with a reason to choose the company\u2019s offering. Consider the following position -\ning statements for Hertz, Volvo, and Domino\u2019s, respectively, which have guided their communication \ncampaigns through the years with their target customers.\nFor busy professionals (target customers), Hertz offers a fast, convenient way to rent the right \ntype of car at an airport (value proposition).\nFor safety-conscious upscale families (target customers), Volvo offers the safest, most durable \nautomobile in which your family can ride (value proposition).\nFor convenience-minded pizza lovers (target customers), Domino\u2019s offers a delicious hot \npizza, delivered promptly to your door (value proposition).\nAn important question in developing a positioning statement is deciding whether to promote the \nspecific attributes describing a company\u2019s offering or to focus on the ultimate benefits delivered by \nthese attributes. Many marketers tend to focus on the benefits  as the pillars of the offering\u2019s  positioning. \nThis is because consumers are usually more interested in benefits and in what exactly they will get \nfrom a product.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33aac2ed-3866-4f95-9b88-06b9da0fb27f": {"__data__": {"id_": "33aac2ed-3866-4f95-9b88-06b9da0fb27f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b787d2a9-1b6b-43b7-8974-89555997311e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "47a434f779e008bf9233841a7f8e4df1b89d7c98ab228f655bac82f933ae8dee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b97912d-70c6-4478-b135-bea33482672e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "c38457d874fcd1b424abdf4a2e98d20d16eef3073d01932dfd7d4b978f21a75e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df2c2b57-e7b1-4182-8338-76ebe67eb2a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "817831871a410c38e108b76c64ba2e29ff6aeceef7f09319f9adee2ef7174d36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 7    |  CRAFTING  A CUSTOMER  VALUE  PROPOSITION  AND  POSITIONING  153\nOffering attributes , on the other hand, generally play more of a supporting role. Multiple attributes \nmay support a certain benefit, and they may change over time. Attributes provide \u201creasons to believe\u201d \nor \u201cproof points\u201d for why a brand can credibly claim it offers certain benefits. Marketers of Dove soap, \nfor example, will talk about how its attribute of one-quarter cleansing cream uniquely creates the \nbenefit of softer skin. Singapore Airlines can boast about its superior customer service because of its \nhighly trained flight attendants and strong service culture.\nCOMMUNICATING CATEGORY MEMBERSHIP\nCategory membership may be obvious. Target customers are aware that Maybelline is a leading \nbrand of cosmetics, Cheerios is a leading brand of cereal, McKinsey is a leading consulting firm, \nand so on. But when a product is new, marketers must inform consumers of the brand\u2019s category \nmembership.\nSometimes consumers may know the category membership but not be convinced that the brand \nis a valid member of the category. They may be aware that HP produces digital cameras, but they may \nnot be certain whether HP cameras are in the same class as those made by Canon, Nikon, and Sony. In \nthis instance, HP might find it useful to reinforce category membership.\nBrands are sometimes affiliated with categories in which they do not hold membership. This \napproach is one way to highlight a brand\u2019s point of difference, providing that consumers know its \nactual membership. Instead of putting DiGiorno\u2019s frozen pizza in the frozen pizza category, market -\ners have positioned it in the delivered pizza category with ads that proclaim, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Delivery, It\u2019s \nDiGiorno!\u201d Similarly, pay channel HBO has developed original, edgy programming to justify its pre -\nmium fee, adopting the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s Not TV, It\u2019s HBO.\u201d\nThe typical approach to positioning is to inform consumers of a brand\u2019s membership before stat -\ning its point of difference. Presumably, consumers need to know what a product is and what function \nit serves before deciding whether it is superior to the brands against which it competes. For new prod -\nucts, initial advertising often concentrates on creating brand awareness, and subsequent advertising \nattempts to create the brand image. Ally Bank tapped into a distrust of financial institutions to stake \nout a unique positioning.\nAlly Financial  In rebranding GMAC Financial as Ally Financial and launching its Ally Bank \nsubsidiary, the firm initially ran a campaign featuring a smarmy man in a suit (who symbolically \nrepresented the typical bank) being mean to unsuspecting children (who symbolically represented \ntypical bank customers). The idea was to show Ally Bank as simple and direct. One ad had the \nslick spokesperson sitting with two young girls at a small table asking one of them whether she \nwanted a pony. When the girl said yes, he gave her a small toy pony. When the other girl said \nyes, he gave her a real pony. The clearly unhappy first girl asked why she didn\u2019t get a real pony, \nand the man answered, in effect, \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Having established initial awareness, the \ncampaign developed its \u201cstraightforward\u201d positioning with several follow-up ads relaying a \u201cYour \nMoney Needs an Ally\u201d theme and touting customers\u2019 ability to reach humans at Ally Bank instead \nof\u00a0machines. In the \u201cDry Cleaner\u201d ad, seemingly real customers of a dry cleaner are captured via \nhidden camera as they attempt to cope with a blender that a sign indicates they should use for \nhelp. The ad ends with the words \u201cAlly Bank. Helpful People. Not Machines.\u201d29\nThere are three main ways to convey a brand\u2019s category membership:\n\u2022 Announcing category benefits.  To reassure consumers that a brand will deliver on the fundamental \nreason for using a category, marketers frequently use benefits to announce category membership. \nThus, industrial tools might claim to have durability, and antacids might announce their efficacy. \nA brownie mix might attain membership in the baked desserts category by claiming to offer the \nbenefit of great taste and might support this claim by including high-quality ingredients (perfor -\nmance) or by showing users delighting in its consumption (imagery).\n\u2022 Comparing to exemplars.  Well-known, noteworthy brands in a category can also help a brand spec -\nify its category membership.

ConAgra must convince consumers \nthat Healthy Choice frozen foods both taste good and are good for you. Consider these examples of \nnegatively correlated attributes and benefits: low price versus high quality, powerful versus safe, taste \nversus low calories, strong versus refined, nutritious versus good tasting, ubiquitous versus exclusive, \nefficacious versus mild, and varied versus simple.\nMoreover, individual attributes and benefits often have positive and negative aspects. For example, \nconsider a long-lived brand such as La-Z-Boy recliners, Burberry outerwear, or the New York Times . The \nbrand\u2019s heritage could suggest experience, wisdom, and expertise as well as authenticity. On the other \nhand, it could also imply being old-fashioned and not contemporary or up to date.\nThe challenge is that consumers typically want to maximize both  of the negatively correlated attri -\nbutes or benefits. Much of the art and science of marketing consists of dealing with trade-offs, and \npositioning is no different. The best approach clearly is to develop a product or service that performs \nwell on both dimensions.

When in-depth and quantitative interviews \nand focus groups suggested that consumers wanted the benefits of technology without the hassles, \nRoyal Philips launched its \u201cSense and Simplicity\u201d campaign for its Philips brand of electronics, which \ntouted its products as easy to use.\nOther approaches include launching two different marketing campaigns, each devoted to a dif -\nferent brand attribute or benefit: one linking the brand to a person, place, or thing that possesses the \nright kind of equity to establish an attribute or benefit as a POP or POD; and the other convincing \nconsumers that the negative relationship between attributes and benefits, if they consider it differently, \nis in fact positive.30\nPOSITIONING AS STORYTELLING\nRather than outlining specific attributes or benefits, some marketing experts describe positioning \na brand as telling a narrative or story. Consumers like the richness and imagination they can derive \nfrom thinking of the story behind a product or service.\nTo help sharpen its marketing and positioning, Jim Beam, with its namesake Jim Beam and Maker\u2019s \nMark brands, hired The Moth, a group of professional storytellers best known for a weekly public radio >> Jim Beam has used \nprofessional storytellers \nto sharpen its marketing \nand positioning.\nSource: Alko/Alamy Stock Photo>> After former GMAC \nFinancial Services \nwas rebranded \nALLY Financial, its \nnewly launched Ally \nBank subsidiary\u2019s \nad campaign touted \na straightforward, \nno-gimmicks approach \nto customer service, \nstressing interaction \nwith people rather than \nmachines. \nSource: Piotr Swat/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3413, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11ee5b4f-f25f-4dd8-9b6d-dfd6888d4c8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "11ee5b4f-f25f-4dd8-9b6d-dfd6888d4c8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c91ab885-72ec-4e02-9e92-878b5a216353", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "20b5221ea494dd77d700b0defbdfb02a4d6a0dcda2b494f8701dda549ce19b2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af853344-c227-432c-8f79-13e8db3dd162", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap7.pdf"}, "hash": "c94d38077c04e188d8e6e237359e45019114aed1b4925e3dad8aac39bd951c1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a15a9b56-66fb-49ef-b5a7-1b687cdd21cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eeb24d01244cb6a63148c6983c446241865de5a8c256db94f3b4db7079228629", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 7    |  CRAFTING  A CUSTOMER  VALUE  PROPOSITION  AND  POSITIONING  155\nbroadcast, to kick off a three-day biannual gathering of its marketing teams.

This approach enabled the company to come up with a compelling \nstory articulating its customer value proposition.31\nSome researchers see narrative branding  as based on deep metaphors that connect to people\u2019s \nmemories, associations, and stories.32 They identify five elements of narrative branding: the brand \nstory in terms of words and metaphors; the consumer journey or the way consumers engage with the \nbrand over time, and touch points where they come into contact with the brand; the visual language \nor expression for the brand; the manner in which the narrative is expressed experientially or the brand \nengages the senses; and the role the brand plays in the lives of consumers. Based on literary convention \nand brand experience, they also identify four key aspects of a brand story: (1) setting (the time, place, \nand context), (2) cast (the brand as a character, including its role in the life of the audience, its relation -\nships and responsibilities, and its history or creation myth), (3) narrative arc (the way the narrative \nlogic unfolds over time, including actions, desired experiences, defining events, and the moment of \nepiphany), and (4) language (the authenticating voice, metaphors, symbols, themes, and leitmotifs).\nA related concept referred to as \u201cprimal branding\u201d views brands as complex belief systems. \n Proponents of primal branding argue that diverse brands such as Google, MINI Cooper, the U.S. Marine \nCorps, Starbucks, Apple, UPS, and Aveda all have a \u201cprimal code\u201d or DNA that resonates with their \ncustomers and generates their passion and fervor. There are seven assets that make up this belief system \nor primal code: a creation story, creed, icon, rituals, sacred words, a way of dealing with nonbelievers, \nand a good leader.33\nmarketing\nINSIGHT\n\u2022 Encourage product or service trial in any way pos -\nsible.

Consumers determine the value of an offering relative to \na frame of reference  used to assess its benefits and costs. An \noffering can be viewed as attractive in comparison to an \ninferior offering, and the same offering can be perceived \nas unattractive when compared to a superior offering. \nMarketers must carefully select a frame of reference that \nhighlights the value of their offering.\n6. A key component of developing a positioning strategy is \nidentifying the points of difference \u2014attributes or benefits \nthat are unique to the company\u2019s offering\u2014and the \npoints of parity \u2014attributes or benefits that the company\u2019s \noffering has in common with the competition.

The company has developed some of the most \nsuccessful brands in the world, including Axe, a male groom-\ning brand, and Dove, a personal-care brand aimed at women.\nThe Axe brand (known as Lynx in the UK, Ireland, \n Australia, and China) launched in 1983, was introduced in the \nUnited States in 2002, and is now sold in over 70 different \ncountries. Axe offers young male consumers a wide range \nof personal-care products such as body sprays, body gel, \ndeodorant, and shampoo, which come in a variety of different \nscents. Today, Axe is the most popular male grooming brand \nin the world. Axe effectively broke through the clutter by find-\ning the right target group and luring these customers with \npersonal marketing messages that hit home.\nUnilever categorized the male population into several dif-\nferent profile groups and decided that the biggest opportunity \nexisted in the segment\u2014dubbed \u201cThe Insecure Novice\u201d\u2014 \ncomposed of geeks and nerds who needed help attract-\ning the opposite sex and could easily be persuaded to buy \nproducts to help their appearance. Most Axe ads targeting \nthis segment use humor and sex, often featuring skinny, aver -\nage guys attracting beautiful girls by the dozens, hundreds, \nor even thousands after dousing themselves with Axe. The \nresult: the brand is aspirational and approachable, and the \nlight-hearted tone hits home with young men.\nAxe has won numerous advertising awards not only for \nits creativity but also for its effective use of unconventional \nmedia channels. From edgy online videos to video games, \nmating game tool kits, chat rooms, and mobile apps, the Axe \nbrand engages young adult males at relevant times, locations, \nand environments. In Colombia, for example, a female Axe \nPatrol scopes out the bar and club scene and sprays men with \nAxe body sprays. Unilever marketing director Kevin George \nexplained, \u201cThis is all about going beyond the 30-  second TV \ncommercial to create a deeper bond with our guy.\u201d\nAxe knows where to reach its consumers. It advertises \nonly on male-dominated networks such as MTV, ESPN, \nSpike, and Comedy Central. It partners with the NBA and \nNCAA, which draw in young male audiences, and also \nruns ads during big sporting events. Print ads appear in \nSource: Retro AdArchives/Alamy Stock Photo\n( continued  )Playboy , Rolling Stone , GQ, and Maxim . Axe\u2019s online efforts \nvia  Facebook and Twitter help drive consumers back to its \n website, TheAxeEffect.com.\nUnilever understands that it must keep the brand fresh, \nrelevant, and cool in order to stay current with its fickle young \naudience. As a result, the company launches a new fragrance \nannually and refreshes its online and advertising communica-\ntions constantly, realizing that new males enter and exit its \ntarget market each year. Perhaps even more important than \nupdating its product line is keeping the brand relevant and \nin tune with the social trends.

At the time, the eyewear industry \nwas  dominated by two companies\u2014Luxottica and  Essilor. \n Luxottica designed, manufactured, and retailed most \n eyewear frames sold. The company held licenses for many \nof the most popular brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Ray-Ban, \nand Oakley, and owned optical retail chains like LensCrafters \nand Sunglass Hut. Whereas Luxottica specialized in frames, \n Essilor, the largest optical lens wholesaler in the United \nStates, dominated the lenses portion of the eyewear industry. \nin questioning the boundaries of the traditional image of \nmanhood and thus establishes an emotional connection with \nthe brand.\nOn the other side of the personal marketing spectrum, \nUnilever\u2019s Dove brand speaks to women with a different tone \nand message. In 2003, Dove shifted away from its historical \nadvertising, which touted the brand\u2019s benefit of one-quarter \nmoisturizing cream, and launched the \u201cDove Campaign for \nReal Beauty.\u201d \u201cReal Beauty\u201d celebrated \u201creal\u201d women and \nspoke personally to women about the notion that beauty \ncomes in all shapes, sizes, ages, and colors. The campaign \narose from research revealing that only 4 percent of women \nworldwide think they are beautiful.\nThe first phase of the \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign featured \nnontraditional female models and asked viewers to judge \ntheir looks online and decide whether they were \u2018Wrinkled \nor Wonderful?\u2019 or \u2018Oversized or Outstanding?\u2019 The personal \nquestions shocked many but created such a large PR buzz \nthat Dove continued the campaign. The second phase of the \ncampaign featured candid and confident images of curvy, \nfull-bodied women. Again, the Dove brand smashed stereo -\ntypes of what usually appeared in advertising and, as a result, \ntouched a chord with the majority of women worldwide. The \nthird phase of the campaign, called \u201cPro-Age,\u201d featured older, \nnude women and asked questions like \u201cDoes beauty have an \nage limit?\u201d Immediately, the company heard positive feedback \nfrom its older consumers. Dove also started a  Self-Esteem \nFund, aimed at helping women feel better about their looks.\nAs part of the \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign, Dove released a \nseries of short Dove Films, one of which, Evolution , won both \na Cyber and a film Grand Prix at the International Advertising \nFestival in Cannes in 2007. The film shows a rapid-motion \nview of an ordinary-looking woman transformed by makeup \nartists, hairdressers, lighting, and digital retouching to end \nup looking like a billboard supermodel. The end tagline is \n\u201cNo wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.\u201d The film \ninstantly became a viral hit.Dove followed up with Onslaught , a short film that \nshowed a young, innocent, fresh-faced girl being bombarded \nwith images of sexy, half-dressed women and promises of \nproducts to make her look \u201csmaller,\u201d \u201csofter,\u201d \u201cfirmer,\u201d and \n\u201cbetter.\u201d Dove\u2019s 2013 film called Sketches  featured a police \nsketch artist who drew two pictures of the same woman. In \none, the woman described herself to the sketch artist from \nbehind a curtain, and in the other picture a total stranger \ndescribed the woman she had just met to the sketch artist. \nThe difference in language and descriptions revealed how \nwomen are often their own harshest beauty critics and ended \nwith the tagline \u201cYou are more beautiful than you think.\u201d The \nSketches  film has become the most watched video advertise-\nment of all time and attracted over 175 million views in its first \nyear alone.\nAlthough the Axe and Dove campaigns couldn\u2019t be \nmore different, and both have sparked much controversy \nand debate, the two brands have been credited with effec-\ntively targeting their consumer base with personal marketing \nstrategies and spot-on messages.

In addition, almost all glasses sales \nwere made in brick-and-mortar locations. Warby Parker\u2019s \nfounders believed that there was significant opportunity in \nselling designer glasses at low prices and using the internet \nto make its sales.\nWarby Parker was able to set low prices by vertically \nintegrating the company. It began by hiring a full-time glasses \ndesigner and two experienced contractors. By creating its \nown collections of eyeglass frames, Warby Parker avoided \nlicensing fees from designer companies and the need to \npurchase frames from Luxottica. The company acquired \nits eyeglass materials from a family-owned Italian producer \nand outsourced its manufacturing to production factories in \nChina. The production process was completed in optical labs \nlocated in New York, where pre-made lenses were carved \nand fit into the frames. The company\u2019s use of pre-made \nframes, instead of applying prescriptions directly onto frames, \nreduced costs dramatically. These factors resulted in Warby \nParker\u2019s ability to provide eyeglasses starting from the low \nprice of $95.\nWarby Parker designs its glasses to appeal to fashion-\nforward and trendy customers looking to express their \nindividualism. Each Warby Parker design has its own name, \noften referencing famous literary or military figures\u2014e.g., \nthe  Moriarty, Daisy, and Roosevelt frames. The frames are \ninspired by retro and vintage glasses but are modernized to \ncreate a \u201ctimeless\u201d look. In addition, each frame is offered in \na wide selection of colors and patterns, ranging from simple \ntones to more eye-catching stripes and gradients.\nThe majority of Warby Parker\u2019s sales are made through \nits website. Warby Parker has changed the eyeglass market \nby paving the way for online sales. To incentivize customers \nwho were unfamiliar with the legitimacy of buying glasses \nonline, Warby Parker offered policies such as free shipping, \na 30-day \u201cno questions asked\u201d return policy, and its famous \nhome try-on program. Consumers typically try on many pairs \nof glasses in-store before they make a purchase. Warby \nParker has retained this functionality by giving customers \nthe option to try up to five different pairs of eyeglasses, at \nno additional cost, to see whether they like them.  Customers \ncan keep these glasses for a week before sending them \nback to the company. These customer-friendly policies \nhelped Warby Parker establish its footing in e-commerce and \nbecome a giant in the online eyeglass market.\nThree years after the Warby Parker website launched, \nthe company created a physical retail presence by opening its own retail locations. Warby Parker launched its first store \nin 2013 for customers who wanted to come in and try on \nglasses. Warby Parker stores function as showrooms for their \nglasses. Focusing on the consumer experience, they feature \nwide, open walking spaces with easy-to-access shelves \ndisplaying the glasses collections. In these brick-and-mortar \nlocations, staff members walk around the store answering \nquestions and helping customers find their favorite pair of \nglasses. Once customers choose the pair they like, employ-\nees quickly place their order on the website.\nA core component of Warby Parker\u2019s mission is \u201clead -\ning the way for socially conscious businesses,\u201d and its \ncharitable mission has attracted many Millennials looking to \nsupport socially responsible businesses. The most notable \nof Warby Parker\u2019s social programs is its \u201cBuy a Pair, Give a \nPair\u201d program, where for every one pair of glasses sold, one \npair of glasses is distributed in developing countries. Since \nthe  company\u2019s beginning, Warby Parker has partnered with \nVisionSpring, a nonprofit dedicated to providing eyewear to \nthe less fortunate in the developing world.
