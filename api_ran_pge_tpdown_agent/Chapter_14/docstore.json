Amway distributors, commonly \nreferred to as \u201cindependent business owners, \u201d earn income from the retail markup on the prod -\nucts they sell directly to customers, as well as a percentage of product sales from the downstream \ndistributors they have recruited and mentored\u2014a pyramid-like distribution system that enables Companies seeking to expand profits and sales must invest time and resources searching for new \ncustomers.

Although mass and digital communications provide many benefits, \nthere are times when personal communications are needed to be relevant and close a sale.

Amway\u2019s multilevel marketing model came \nunder  scrutiny as early as 1979, when the Federal Trade Commission, after investigating Amway, \n determined that the company\u2019s business model was not an illegal pyramid scheme because recruits \nwere selling the company\u2019s products to real customers, not just to other recruits. To sustain its \n market position, Amway heavily invests in research and development. A holder of 800 patents, it has  \nover 100 scientific laboratories worldwide with nearly 1,000 scientists, engineers, and  technical \n professionals on staff. The largest direct seller in the world, with 17,000 + global employees, \nAmway generated $8.4 billion in 2019, when nutrition and weight-management products accounted \nfor 54\u00a0percent of Amway\u2019s revenues, followed by beauty and personal care products (25 percent).1\nPersonalizing communications and saying and doing the right thing for the right person at the right \ntime are critical for marketing effectiveness. In this chapter, we consider how companies personalize \ntheir marketing communications to have more impact. We begin by evaluating personal selling and \nthen move on to consider direct marketing.\nPersonal Selling\nPersonal selling  involves direct interaction with one or more prospective buyers for the purpose of \nmaking presentations, answering questions, and procuring orders (sales presentations, sales meet -\nings, incentive programs, samples, and fair and trade shows). Personal selling is the most effective \ntool at later stages of the buying process, particularly in influencing buyer preferences, conviction, \nand action.2\nWell-known companies that use a personal-selling model are Avon and Electrolux. Tupperware \nand Mary Kay cosmetics are sold one-to-many: A salesperson goes to the home of a host who has \ninvited friends; the salesperson demonstrates the products and takes orders. The multilevel (network) \nmarketing sales system works by recruiting independent businesspeople who act as distributors. The \ndistributor\u2019s compensation includes a percentage of sales made by those he or she recruits, as well as \nearnings on his or her own direct sales to customers.\nPersonal selling has three notable qualities:\n\u2022 It is customized , meaning that the message can be designed to appeal to any individual.\n\u2022 It is relationship oriented , meaning that personal-selling relationships can range from a matter-of-fact \nselling relationship to a deep personal friendship.\n\u2022 It is response oriented , meaning that the buyer is often given personal choices and encouraged to \nrespond directly.\nPersonal selling is an ancient art. Effective salespeople today have more than instinct to guide \nthem, however. Companies now spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to train them in \nmethods of analysis and customer management and to transform them from passive order-takers into \nactive order-getters.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3303, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd097fec-7ccb-4ba9-9ddc-73e6033621ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd097fec-7ccb-4ba9-9ddc-73e6033621ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8e81e9d-f25e-4fa2-ad3c-3840ecaa51ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "09f691b63f42eb074db9bdb612de13182131104711d048da10299b9b82d4f803", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b349c46e-f11b-4f08-a573-0f2fca63d7d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "5d12f0bd10868767725c3c9a3204c6c0e586d492a4c736f35ae9aa759cf3f90b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eccddbc4-a5f8-4ac8-99d8-3431f933e210", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fbf95f07ce31788f10326cc939096563e361621208f05aabf27a2115f35c3ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "306 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nPERSONAL SELLING AS A PROCESS\nMost sales training programs agree on the major steps in any effective sales process.

The first step in selling is to identify and qualify prospects. \nMore companies are taking responsibility for finding and qualifying leads so that salespeople can \nuse their expensive time doing what they do best: selling.4 Some companies, including IBM, qualify \nleads according to the acronym BANT: Does the customer have the necessary budget,  the authority  \nto buy, a compelling need  for the product or service, and a timeline  for delivery that aligns with what \nis possible?\nMany marketers are going beyond the BANT approach and getting increasingly sophisticated in \ntheir pursuit of qualified leads. Using inputs as diverse as prospects\u2019 hiring practices, job boards, and \nsample tweets from customers and employees, companies use data analytics and artificial intelligence \nto classify prospects as worth a call or offer\u2014or not.\nMarketers must find the right balance between the quantity and quality of leads. Too many leads, \neven of high quality, and the sales force may be overwhelmed and allow the most promising opportuni -\nties to fall through the cracks; too few or low-quality leads and the sales force may become frustrated \nor demoralized.\nTo generate high-quality leads, suppliers need to know their customers. Suppliers that qualify \nmay be visited by the buyer\u2019s agents, who will examine the suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and meet \ntheir staff. After evaluating each company, the buyer will end up with a short list of qualified suppliers. \nMany professional buyers have forced suppliers to make adjustments to their marketing proposals to \nincrease their likelihood of making the cut.\nPre-approach.  The salesperson should learn as much as possible about the prospect company \n(what it needs, who takes part in the purchase decision) and its buyers (personal characteristics and \nbuying styles). How is the purchasing process conducted at the company? How is it structured?\nCompanies can vary in their purchasing process and company structure. At many large compa -\nnies, salespeople interact with purchasing departments tasked with procuring goods for the organiza -\ntion. Many purchasing departments in larger companies have been centralized and elevated to strategic \nsupply departments with more professional practices. Centralized purchasing may put a premium on \ndealing with larger suppliers that are able to meet all the company\u2019s needs. At the same time, some \ncompanies are decentralizing purchasing for smaller items such as coffeemakers, office supplies, and \nother inexpensive necessities. The sales rep must thoroughly understand the purchasing process in \nterms of \u201cwho, when, where, how, and why\u201d in order to set call objectives: to qualify the prospect, \ngather information, or make an immediate sale.\nAnother challenge is to choose the best contact approach\u2014a personal visit, phone call, e-mail, or \nletter. The right approach is crucial because it has become harder for sales reps to get into the offices \nof purchasing agents, physicians, and other time-starved and internet-enabled potential customers. \nFinally, the salesperson should plan an overall sales strategy for the account.\nPresentation and Demonstration.  A common way of telling the product \u201cstory\u201d to the \nbuyer is captured by the FABV approach, which focuses on articulating the features, advantages, benefits,  \nand value  of the company\u2019s offering.\n\u2022 Features  describe the physical characteristics of a market offering. For example, a computer\u2019s fea -\ntures include processing speed and memory capacity.\n\u2022 Advantages  describe why the features give the customer an edge.\n\u2022 Benefits  describe the economic, technical, service, and social payback delivered.\n\u2022 Value  describes the offering\u2019s worth (often in monetary terms).\nThe FABV approach helps the sales force adequately allocate the effort when promoting different \naspects of the product. This is important because salespeople often spend too much time on product \nfeatures (a product orientation) and not enough time stressing benefits and value (a customer orien -\ntation), especially in highly competitive markets or when selling individualized or premium-priced \nproducts.5 To be effective, the pitch to a prospective client must be highly relevant, engaging, and \ncompelling. There is always another company waiting to take that business.FIGURE 14.1 \nMajor Steps in \nEffective Selling\nProspecting\nPre-approach\nPresentation\nPersuasion\nClosing\nServicing", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4801, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eccddbc4-a5f8-4ac8-99d8-3431f933e210": {"__data__": {"id_": "eccddbc4-a5f8-4ac8-99d8-3431f933e210", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6294b53a-c6e6-45dd-9b58-76b962b7971f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "16d7782e9c70b7ab72f9f237405f26cd72a4e639efd75ebaf161a2a6dc3be354", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd097fec-7ccb-4ba9-9ddc-73e6033621ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "09f691b63f42eb074db9bdb612de13182131104711d048da10299b9b82d4f803", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e1f101c-49b6-43bc-b0b0-c3286e1d41fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df78ba410eb5149eda2aaf05069c9f5b0a789cdb974078c8b84d7382a1d61ba0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 14    |  PErSONAL  SELLING  AND  DIrECT MArkETING  307\nPersuasion.  Selling is not a unidirectional process in which sellers simply present information to \nbuyers. Rather, selling is an interactive process where buyers typically raise questions and pose objec -\ntions. Most objections stem from two sources: psychological resistance and logical resistance.\n\u2022 Psychological resistance  includes resistance to interference, preference for established supply \nsources or brands, apathy, reluctance to give up something, unpleasant associations created by the \nsales rep, predetermined ideas, dislike of making decisions, and an anxious attitude toward money.\n\u2022 Logical resistance might consist of objections to the price, delivery schedule, or product or com -\npany characteristics.\nTo handle psychological and logical objections, the salesperson maintains a positive approach, \nasks the buyer to clarify the objection, questions in such a way that the buyer answers his own objec -\ntion, denies the validity of the objection, or turns it into a reason for buying.6\nAlthough price is the most frequently negotiated issue\u2014especially in tight economic times\u2014  \nothers include contract completion time, quality of goods and services offered, purchase volume, prod -\nuct safety, and responsibility for financing, risk taking, promotion, and title. Salespeople sometimes \ngive in too easily when customers demand a discount.7\nOne company recognized this problem when sales revenues went up 25 percent but profit \nremained flat. The company decided to retrain its salespeople to \u201csell the price\u201d rather than \u201csell \nthrough price.\u201d Salespeople were given richer information about each customer\u2019s sales history and \nbehavior. They received training to recognize value-adding opportunities rather than price-cutting \nopportunities. As a result, the company\u2019s sales revenues climbed and so did its margins.8\nClosing.  Closing is an essential component of the selling process. Without closing the deal, there is \nno sale. A skillful salesperson knows when and how to close the sale in a way that will not only secure \nthe deal at hand but also help establish a long-term relationship with the buyer.9\nTo determine when to start closing, sellers pay close attention to buyers\u2019 behavior, looking for \nsigns that the buyer is ready to finalize the purchase decision. Closing signs from the buyer include \nphysical actions, statements or comments, and questions. Sales representatives can ask for the order, \nrecapitulate the points of agreement, offer to help write up the order, ask whether the buyer wants A \nor B, get the buyer to make minor choices such as color or size, or indicate what the buyer will lose by \nnot placing the order now.\nThe salesperson might offer specific inducements to close, such as an additional service, an extra \nquantity, or a token gift. If the client still isn\u2019t budging, perhaps the salesperson is not interacting with \nthe right executive; a more senior person may have the necessary authority. The salesperson also may \nneed to find other ways to reinforce the value of the offering and how it alleviates financial or other \npressures the client faces.\nServicing.  Follow-up and maintenance are necessary to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat \nbusiness. Immediately after closing, the salesperson should cement any necessary details about delivery \ntime, purchase terms, and other matters important to the customer. When relevant, the salesperson \nmight schedule a follow-up call after delivery to ensure proper installation, instruction, and servicing. \nIn addition, the salesperson might try to detect any potential problems with the offering, suggest solu -\ntions, alleviate concerns, and reaffirm the buyer\u2019s positive attitude toward the purchase.\nWhile servicing the account, the salesperson should have a plan on how to maintain and grow \nthe account. Providing a service that goes beyond the actual sale can demonstrate to customers that \nthe seller stands behind its products and services and is committed to building a relationship with the \nbuyer. Using after-sale servicing can help build a long-term relationship that benefits both parties by \nimproving the overall purchase experience and creating a sense of trust between the buyer and seller.\nMANAGING THE SALE\nMany of the principles of personal selling and negotiation are largely transaction oriented because their \npurpose is to close a specific sale. But in many cases, the company seeks not an immediate sale but rather \na long-term supplier\u2013customer relationship. Today\u2019s customers prefer suppliers who can sell and deliver a \ncoordinated set of products and services to many locations, who can quickly solve problems in different \nlocations, and who can work closely with customer teams to improve products and processes.10\nSalespeople working with key customers must do more than e-mail or call when they think cus -\ntomers might be ready to place orders.

They should monitor key accounts, know customers\u2019 \nproblems, and be ready to serve them in a number of ways, adapting and responding to different \ncustomer needs or situations.11 A popular approach for managing the sale process is SPIN, an acro -\nnym derived from the types of questions that a salesperson should ask prospects: situation questions, \nproblem questions, implication questions, and need-payoff questions.\nDesigning the Sales Force\nThe original and oldest form of direct marketing is visiting target customers (prospects) in person. \nTo locate prospects, develop them into customers, and grow the business, most industrial companies \nrely heavily on a professional sales force or hire manufacturers\u2019 representatives and agents. Many \nconsumer companies such as Allstate, Amway, Avon, Mary Kay, Merrill Lynch, and Tupperware use \na direct-selling force.\nTupperware  Tupperware was founded in 1946, when inventor Earl Tupper introduced \nhis airtight seals, patterned after the inverted rim on a can of paint, to prevent food from drying \nout. Despite their breakthrough nature, his products didn\u2019t sell well in retail outlets, mainly \nbecause their advantage over regular storage containers was not readily visible to buyers. \nrealizing that consumers needed demonstrations in order to understand how the product \nworked, Tupper introduced the Tupperware Home Party as a way for his products to reach \nconsumers. Demonstrations proved an extremely effective way of communicating the benefits \nof the revolutionary seal, and several years later all Tupperware products were taken off store \nshelves to be distributed through direct selling alone. In addition to being a source of income, \nhome parties were also a welcome diversion for women whose social circles revolved around \ntheir family. As consumers relocated to homes in the suburbs, backyard parties became a \nfavorite way for families and neighbors to socialize. Tupperware products addressed needs \ncreated by this increasingly popular pastime by helping to keep food fresh outdoors as well as \ntransporting it to and from parties. When microwaves became commonplace kitchen appliances, \nTupperware introduced products designed specifically for microwaves, enabling consumers \nto warm up leftovers or cook the frozen foods that were growing in popularity. In addition to \nconstantly innovating and extending its product line, Tupperware also introduced classes and \ndemonstrations where customers learned about microwave cooking and food preparation, as well \nas ways to save money on their grocery bills, optimize cabinet space, and manage time. To fit \nthe busy schedules of time-pressed customers, Tupperware introduced in-office demonstrations. \nBe\u00a0it at home or office parties, personal selling has always been the defining aspect of \nTupperware. With the help of its more than 3 million sales force members, Tupperware now is \nfound in nearly 100 markets around the world, offering culturally distinct items such as the kimchi \nkeeper, the kimono keeper, and the Japanese Bento Box.12\nFIGURE 14.2 \nDesigning the Sales \nForce\nObjectives\nStrategy\nStructure\nSize\nCompensationU.S. firms spend more than a trillion dollars annually on sales forces and sales force materials\u2014\nmore than on any other promotional method. More than 10 percent of the total workforce works in \nsales occupations, both nonprofit and for profit. Hospitals and museums, for example, use fundraisers \nto contact donors and solicit donations. In asserting that selling is the core function of every company, \nBoston Beer founder Jim Koch notes, \u201cWithout sales, there is no business to manage.\u201d13\nAlthough no one debates the importance of the sales force in marketing programs, companies \nare sensitive to the high and rising costs of maintaining one, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, \ntravel expenses, and benefits. Not surprisingly, companies are trying to increase sales force productiv -\nity through better selection, training, supervision, motivation, and compensation.14\nSalespeople are the company\u2019s personal link to its customers. In designing the sales force, the com -\npany must develop sales force objectives, strategy, structure, size, and compensation (see Figure 14.2).\nSALES FORCE OBJECTIVES\nThe days when all the sales force did was \u201csell, sell, and sell\u201d are long gone.

A direct (company) sales force consists of full- or part-time paid employees who work \nexclusively for the company.

On the other hand, a company that sells many products to customers with diverse needs \nmight organize its sales force around specific products, services, or customer needs.\nSome companies need a more complex structure and adopt some combination of four types of \nsales force: a strategic market sales force assigned to major accounts (see \u201cMarketing Insight: Major \nAccount Management\u201d), a geographic sales force calling on customers in different territories, a distribu -\ntor sales force calling on and coaching distributors, and an inside sales force marketing and taking orders \nonline and via phone.\nTo manage costs, companies often choose a leveraged sales force that focuses reps on selling the \ncompany\u2019s more complex and customized products to large accounts and uses inside salespeople and \nonline ordering for low-end selling. Salespeople handle fewer accounts and are rewarded for key account \ngrowth; lead generation, proposal writing, order fulfillment, and post-sale support are turned over to \nothers. By motivating salespeople to sell to every possible account, this approach helps overcome some \nof the limitations of geographically based sales forces.19\nCompanies must deploy sales forces strategically so that they call on the right customers at the \nright time in the right way, acting as \u201caccount managers\u201d who arrange fruitful contact between people \nin the buying and selling organizations. Selling increasingly calls for teamwork and the support of oth -\ners, such as top management, especially when national accounts or major sales are at stake; technical \npeople, who supply information and service before, during, and after product purchase; customer-\nservice representatives, who provide installation, maintenance, and other services; and office staff, \nconsisting of sales analysts, order expediters, and assistants.20\nSALES FORCE SIZE\nSales representatives are one of the company\u2019s most productive and expensive assets. Increasing their \nnumber increases both sales and costs. Once the company establishes the number of customers it \nwants to reach, it can use a workload approach  to establish sales force size. A streamlined version of this \nmethod has five steps:\n1. Group customers into size classes according to annual sales volume.\n2. Establish desirable contact frequencies (number of calls on an account per year) for each cus -\ntomer class.\n3. Multiply the number of accounts in each size class by the corresponding call frequency to arrive \nat the total workload for the country, in sales calls per year.\n4. Determine the average number of customer interactions a sales representative can make per year.\n5. Divide the total annual calls required by the average annual customer interactions made by a sales \nrepresentative to arrive at the number of sales representatives needed.\nSuppose the company estimates that it has 1,000 \u201cA\u201d accounts and 2,000 \u201cB\u201d accounts. \u201cA\u201d accounts \nrequire 36 calls a year, and \u201cB\u201d accounts require 12, so the company needs a sales force that can make \n60,000 sales calls (36,000+24,000) a year. If the average full-time rep can make 1,000 calls a year, the \ncompany needs 60 reps.\nSALES FORCE COMPENSATION\nTo attract top-quality reps, the company must develop an attractive compensation package. Sales \nreps want income regularity, extra reward for above-average performance, and fair pay for experience \nand longevity. Management wants control, economy, and simplicity. Some of these objectives will \nconflict. No wonder compensation plans vary tremendously among, and even within, industries.21\nThe company must quantify four components of sales force compensation. The fixed amount,  a sal -\nary, satisfies the need for income stability. The variable amount \u2014whether commissions, quotas, bonus, \nor profit sharing\u2014serves to stimulate and reward effort.22 Expense allowances  enable sales reps to meet", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b30c6785-c8a2-4d45-85a1-c57427bbbfe8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b30c6785-c8a2-4d45-85a1-c57427bbbfe8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a38387f0-1fe8-4868-9aae-c8ac5a07f777", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "ca4dc00b8b968249f4959bbebd46edde075706f62e17f230fa04fb83469924a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ef2f5e7-ab70-4672-8392-c911bd15a805", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "fccadd6260aee4a351314c9d3f29a328ff0fe1088c8c20d36ffe8a373a3a47c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b026ac20-f72f-4513-b7a9-228e4945871f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61b61be5a3d1eee48c5b09519a99561f0465f1efc6686eaae6c8daaf60bd0f97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "312 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nthe costs of travel and entertaining on the company\u2019s behalf. Benefits\u2014 such as paid vacations, sickness \nor accident benefits, pensions, and health and life insurance\u2014provide security and job satisfaction.23\nFixed compensation is common in jobs with a high ratio of non-selling to selling duties and in jobs \nwhere the selling task is technically complex and requires teamwork. Variable compensation works \nbest where sales are cyclical or depend on individual initiative. Fixed and variable compensation give \nrise to three basic types of compensation plans\u2014straight salary, straight commission, and combina -\ntion salary and commission. It is not uncommon for sales reps to receive a significant part of their \ncompensation in variable rather than fixed pay.\nStraight-salary plans provide a secure income, encourage reps to complete non-selling activities, \nand reduce incentive to overstock customers. For the firm, these plans deliver administrative simplic -\nity and lower turnover. When semiconductor company Microchip dropped commissions for its sales \nforce, sales actually increased.24 Straight-commission plans attract higher performers, provide more \nmotivation, require less supervision, and control selling costs. On the negative side, they emphasize \ngetting the sale over building the relationship. Combination plans feature the benefits of both plans, \nwhile limiting their disadvantages.\nPlans that combine fixed and variable pay link the variable portion to a wide variety of strategic \ngoals. One current trend deemphasizes sales volume in favor of gross profitability, customer satisfac -\ntion, and customer retention. Other companies reward reps partly on sales team performance or even \ncompany-wide performance, motivating them to work together for the common good.\nManaging the Sales Force\nVarious policies and procedures guide the firm\u2019s activities directed at managing the sales force. Some \nof the key activities\u2014recruiting, selecting, training, supervising, motivating, and evaluating sales \n representatives\u2014are shown in Figure 14.4 and outlined in more detail in the next sections.\nRECRUITING THE SALES FORCE\nAt the heart of any successful sales force are appropriately selected representatives. It\u2019s a great waste \nto hire the wrong people. The average annual turnover rate of sales reps for all industries is almost \n20 percent. Sales force turnover leads to lost sales, the expense of finding and training replacements, \nand (often) pressure on existing salespeople to pick up the slack.25\nStudies have not always shown a strong relationship between sales performance, on the one hand, \nand background and experience variables, current status, lifestyle, attitude, personality, and skills, on \nthe other. More effective predictors of high performance in sales are composite tests and assessment \ncenters that simulate the working environment and assess applicants in an environment similar to the \none in which they would work.26\nTo maintain a market focus, salespeople should know how to analyze sales data, measure market \npotential, gather market intelligence, and develop marketing strategies and plans. Especially at the \nhigher levels of sales management, they need analytical marketing skills. Marketers believe that sales \nforces are more effective in the long run if they understand and appreciate marketing as well as selling.\nAlthough scores from formal tests are only one element in a set that includes personal character -\nistics, references, past employment history, and interviewer reactions, they have been weighted quite \nheavily by companies such as IBM, Prudential, and Procter & Gamble. Gillette claims that tests have \nreduced turnover and scores have correlated well with the progress of new reps.\nTRAINING AND SUPERVISING THE SALES FORCE\nToday\u2019s customers expect salespeople to have deep product knowledge, add ideas to improve opera -\ntions, and be efficient and reliable. These demands have required companies to make a much greater \ninvestment in sales training.\nNew reps may spend a few weeks to several months in training. The median training period is \n28 weeks in industrial-products companies, 12 in service companies, and 4 in consumer-products \ncompanies. Training time varies with the complexity of the selling task and the type of recruit. New \nmethods of training are continually emerging, such as the use of programmed learning, distance learn -\ning, and videos. Some firms use role playing and sensitivity or empathy training to help reps identify \nwith customers\u2019 situations and motives.27FIGURE 14.4 \nManaging the Sales \nForce\nRecruiting\nTraining\nSupervising\nMotivating\nEvaluating", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4691, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b026ac20-f72f-4513-b7a9-228e4945871f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b026ac20-f72f-4513-b7a9-228e4945871f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57c3890a-1cc6-4ad9-9960-699707697f3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "29ae0930762a59a1491a958ba8fc0cb3bb77c9949a06aae92de2d9735adcd220", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b30c6785-c8a2-4d45-85a1-c57427bbbfe8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "ca4dc00b8b968249f4959bbebd46edde075706f62e17f230fa04fb83469924a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbfb5445-5399-429b-9ec2-febf830f134c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63344de01830020a9905164d58fe1309ffbdbcba2ea753e1539d8993d00d6295", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 14    |  PErSONAL  SELLING  AND  DIrECT MArkETING  313\nReps paid mostly on commission generally receive less supervision. Those who are salaried and \nmust cover definite accounts are likely to receive substantial supervision. With multilevel selling, which \nAvon, Sara Lee, Virgin, and others use, independent distributors are also in charge of their own sales \nforce selling company products. These independent contractors or reps are paid a commission not \nonly on their own sales but also on the sales of people they recruit and train.\nMANAGING SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY\nHow many calls should a company make on a particular account each year? Some sales reps often \nspend too much time selling to smaller, less profitable accounts instead of focusing on larger, more \nprofitable ones.\nLeft to their own devices, many reps will spend most of their time with current customers, who \nare known quantities. Reps can depend on them for some business, whereas a prospect might never \ndeliver any. Companies therefore often specify how much time reps should spend prospecting for new \naccounts.28 Spector Freight wants its sales representatives to spend 25 percent of their time prospecting \nand to stop after three unsuccessful calls. Some companies rely on a missionary sales force to create \nnew interest and open new accounts.\nIn the course of a day, reps plan, travel, wait, sell, and perform administrative tasks (writing reports \nand billing, attending sales meetings, and talking to others in the company about production, deliv -\nery, billing, and sales performance). The best sales reps manage their time efficiently. Time-and-duty \nanalysis  and hour-by-hour breakdowns of activities help them understand how they spend their time \nand how they might increase their productivity.\nCompanies constantly try to improve sales force productivity.29 To cut costs, reduce time demands \non their outside sales force, and leverage technological innovations, many have increased the size and \nresponsibilities of their inside sales force.\nInside selling is less expensive than in-person selling, and it is growing faster. Each contact made \nby an inside salesperson might cost a company $25 to $30, compared with $300 to $500 for a field staff \nperson with travel expenses. Virtual meeting software such as Webex, communication tools such as \nSkype, and social media sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter make it easier to sell with few if \nany face-to-face meetings. And inside sellers don\u2019t even need to be in the office\u2014a growing percentage \nwork at home.30\nThe inside sales force frees outside reps to spend more time selling to major accounts, identify -\ning and converting new major prospects, and obtaining more blanket orders and systems contracts. \nInside salespeople spend more time checking inventory, following up on orders, and phoning smaller \naccounts. They typically earn a salary or salary-plus-bonus pay.\nThe salesperson today has truly gone digital. Not only is sales and inventory information trans -\nferred much more quickly, but specific computer-based decision support systems have been created for \nsales managers and sales representatives. Going online with a tablet or laptop, salespeople can prime \nthemselves on backgrounds of clients, call up prewritten sales letters, transmit orders, and resolve \ncustomer-service issues on the spot, as well as send samples, pamphlets, brochures, and other materi -\nals to clients.\nOne of the most valuable digital tools for the sales rep is the company\u2019s online presence. It can help \ndefine the firm\u2019s relationships with individual accounts and identify those whose business warrants \na personal interaction. It provides an introduction to self-identified potential customers and a way to \ncontact the seller; it might even receive the initial order.\nSocial media are a valuable digital selling tool. Social networking is useful in \u201cfront end\u201d prospect -\ning and lead qualification, as well as in \u201cback end\u201d relationship building and management. When one \nB2B sales rep for virtual-meetings company PGi was monitoring Twitter tweets for various keywords, \nhe noticed that someone from a company tweeted about dissatisfaction with \u201cweb conferencing.\u201d The \nsales rep got in touch with the company\u2019s CEO and was able to quickly convince him of the merits of \nPGi\u2019s products, securing an agreement within a few hours.31\nMOTIVATING THE SALES FORCE\nThe majority of sales representatives require encouragement and special incentives, especially those \nin the field who encounter daily challenges.32 Most marketers believe that the higher the salesperson\u2019s \nmotivation, the greater the effort and the resulting performance, rewards, and satisfaction\u2014all of \nwhich in turn further increase motivation.33", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4774, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbfb5445-5399-429b-9ec2-febf830f134c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbfb5445-5399-429b-9ec2-febf830f134c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a98e3a20-fec0-4122-9d88-7b4eb3fdd22a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "980690a2bbb451860ac65888a64ed5e4634d6c9a9780c1b24e0a01b152f16f45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b026ac20-f72f-4513-b7a9-228e4945871f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "301638c67d62fd6218f37acc2eb184bf19110e7883d9ee44de24c2b62b436e26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43a0dbf6-37ff-4651-9519-bb184cd8af75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8bf7b07846f38884ab0f9b5daa844122b859eea49ceb12a374ee01d936fa198", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "314 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nMarketers reinforce monetary and nonmonetary rewards  of all types. One research study found that \nthe employee reward with the highest value was pay, followed by promotion, personal growth, and \nsense of accomplishment.34 Least valued were liking and respect, security, and recognition. In other \nwords, salespeople are highly motivated by pay and the chance to get ahead and satisfy their intrinsic \nneeds, and they may be less motivated by compliments and security. Some firms use sales contests to \nincrease sales effort.35\nCompensation plans may even need to vary depending on salesperson type\u2014that is, on whether \nthe salespersons are stars, core or solid performers, or laggards.36 Stars  benefit from no ceiling or \ncaps on commissions, overachievement commissions for exceeding quotas, and prize structures that \nallow multiple winners. Core performers benefit from multitier targets that serve as stepping stones \nfor achievement and sales contests with prizes that vary in nature and value. Laggards respond to \nconsistent quarterly bonuses and social pressure.37\nMany companies set annual sales quotas, developed from the annual marketing plan, for dollar \nsales, unit volume, margin, selling effort or activity, or product type. Compensation is often tied to the \ndegree of quota fulfillment. The company first prepares a sales forecast that becomes the basis for plan -\nning production, workforce size, and financial requirements. Management then establishes quotas for \nregions and territories, which typically add up to more than the sales forecast to encourage managers \nand salespeople to perform at their best level. Even if they fail to make their quotas, the company may \nnevertheless reach its sales forecast.38\nConventional wisdom says profits are maximized by sales reps focusing on the more important \nproducts and more profitable products. Reps are unlikely to achieve their quotas for established prod -\nucts when the company is launching several new products at the same time. The company may need \nto expand its sales force for new-product launches.\nSetting sales quotas can create problems. If the company underestimates and the sales reps eas -\nily achieve their quotas, it has overpaid them. If it overestimates sales potential, the salespeople will \nfind it very hard to reach their quotas and will be frustrated or quit. Another downside is that quotas \ncan drive reps to get as much business as possible, often ignoring the service side of the business. The \ncompany gains short-term results at the cost of long-term customer satisfaction. For these reasons, \nsome companies are dropping quotas.\nEVALUATING THE SALES FORCE\nWe have been describing the feed-forward  aspects of sales supervision\u2014how management communi -\ncates what the sales reps should be doing and motivates them to do it. But good feed-forward requires \ngood feedback,  which means getting regular information about reps to evaluate their performance.\nAn important source of information about reps is sales reports. Additional information comes \nthrough personal observation, salesperson self-reports, customer letters and complaints, customer \nsurveys, and conversations with other reps.\nSales reports are divided between activity plans  and write-ups of activity results.  The best example of \nthe former is the salesperson\u2019s work plan, which reps submit a week or month in advance to describe \nintended calls and routing. This report forces sales reps to plan and schedule their activities and inform \nmanagement of their whereabouts. It provides a basis for comparing their plans and accomplishments, \nor their ability to \u201cplan their work and work their plan.\u201d\nMany companies require representatives to develop an annual territory-marketing plan in \nwhich they outline their program for developing new accounts and increasing business from existing \naccounts. Sales managers study these plans, make suggestions, and use them to develop sales quotas. \nSales reps write up completed activities as call reports. They also submit expense reports, new-business \nreports, lost-business reports, and reports on local business and economic conditions.\nThese reports provide raw data from which sales managers can extract key indicators of sales \nperformance: average number of sales calls per salesperson per day, average sales call time per contact, \naverage revenue per sales call, average cost per sales call, entertainment cost per sales call, percentage \nof orders per hundred sales calls, number of new customers per period, number of lost customers per \nperiod, and sales force cost as a percentage of total sales.\nEven if she or he is effective in producing sales, the rep may not rate highly with customers.  Success \nmay come because competitors\u2019 salespeople are inferior, the rep\u2019s product is better, or new customers \nare always found to replace those who dislike the rep. Sales reps can analyze the success or failure of a \nsales call and how they would improve the odds during subsequent calls. Their performance could be \nrelated to internal factors (effort, ability, and strategy) and/or external factors (task and luck).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5173, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43a0dbf6-37ff-4651-9519-bb184cd8af75": {"__data__": {"id_": "43a0dbf6-37ff-4651-9519-bb184cd8af75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ceafe1e3-28f8-42cc-bcbf-989f9389e2e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "2edba50a9236ba9b8909cbb92f185fcfa937b7bd2f7bef254da0c956431b6651", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbfb5445-5399-429b-9ec2-febf830f134c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "980690a2bbb451860ac65888a64ed5e4634d6c9a9780c1b24e0a01b152f16f45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f1a8d76-b0ef-4b14-b8cd-b41e0c5ec3ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2404626cf9f2a25309ffb811987ee1a0e10148f3e7088bec41e5395236d76ee2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 14    |  PErSONAL  SELLING  AND  DIrECT MArkETING  315\nDirect Marketing\nToday, many marketers build long-term relationships with customers. They send birthday cards and \ninformational materials and offer free products and services. Airlines, hotels, and other businesses \nadopt frequency reward programs and club programs.39 Direct marketing  is the use of consumer-\ndirect channels to reach and deliver goods and services to customers without using intermediaries.\nDirect marketing offers companies several advantages. By eliminating the intermediary, it often \nproves to be more cost-effective than traditional marketing. Directly connecting with customers also \ncan provide the company with invaluable information about customers\u2019 current and potential needs, \nthe ways in which they use the company\u2019s offerings, as well as what aspects of the company\u2019s offerings \nthey find particularly beneficial and what aspects need improvement. In addition, having the ability to \ndirectly interact with customers enables the company to offer a superior service experience and build \na stronger brand image.\nDirect marketers can use a number of channels to reach individual prospects and customers: \ndirect mail, catalog marketing, telemarketing, kiosks, websites, and mobile devices. They often seek a \nmeasurable response, typically a customer order, through direct-order marketing.\nAmbit Energy  Ambit Energy was founded in 2006 following the deregulation of energy \nmarkets. The company promotes its services directly to consumers with the help of more than \n80,000 independent consultants. Offering low rates on a one-year fixed-rate contract, Ambit \nhas gained a large customer base, betting that customers are more likely to buy from a person \nthey know than from a stranger. This customer-focused approach has led to rapid growth, \nand in 2010 Ambit was recognized by J.D. Power and Associates as having the most positive \nrecommendations shared with friends, family, and coworkers. Like many direct marketing \ncompanies, Ambit Energy is not without controversies. Consumer advocates are concerned that \nthe company tries very hard to turn customers into salespeople (the front page of Ambit\u2019s website \nurged visitors to \u201cDiscover the rewards of being an Ambit consultant\u201d), while making it rather \ndifficult to reach the company to discuss rates and switch plans. In 2015, Ambit was forced by \nNew York\u2019s Department of Public Service\u2019s Consumer Advocate to issue refunds to customers \nwho were moved from a guaranteed-savings plan into a variable-rate plan charging significantly \nmore. It was also a subject in a class-action lawsuit (settled in 2018) alleging that the company \nmisrepresented the savings that customers would receive after switching to Ambit.40\nDirect marketing has been a fast-growing avenue, partly in response to the high and increasing \ncosts of reaching business markets through a sales force. Sales produced through traditional direct \nmarketing channels (direct mail, catalogs, and telemarketing) have been growing rapidly, along with \ndirect-mail sales, which include sales to the consumer market, B2B sales, and fundraising by charitable \ninstitutions.\nDIRECT MARKETING CHANNELS\nWe next consider some of the issues that characterize the key direct marketing channels: direct mail, \ncatalog marketing, telemarketing, and infomercials.\nDirect Mail.  Direct-mail marketing involves sending an offer, announcement, reminder, or other \nitem to an individual consumer. Using highly selective mailing lists, direct marketers send out millions \nof mail pieces each year\u2014letters, fliers, foldouts, and other \u201csalespeople with wings.\u201d\nDirect mail is a popular medium because it permits target-market selectivity, can be personal -\nized, is flexible, and allows early testing and response measurement. Although the cost per thousand \nis higher than for mass media, the people reached are much better prospects. The success of direct \nmail, however, has also become its liability: So many marketers are sending out direct-mail pieces that \nmailboxes are becoming stuffed, leading some consumers to disregard the blizzard of solicitations \nthey receive. Direct mail can also produce prospect leads, strengthen customer relationships, inform \nand educate customers, remind customers of offers, and reinforce recent customer purchase decisions.\nMost direct marketers apply the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary amount) formula to select \ncustomers according to how much time has passed since their last purchase, how many times they", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f1a8d76-b0ef-4b14-b8cd-b41e0c5ec3ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f1a8d76-b0ef-4b14-b8cd-b41e0c5ec3ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20e84cbb-ffc3-4148-9e1b-0aa609030f52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "c2b2e0728bc150c046897299a416c0349777ce8b71031ac9dd702273f5b70746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43a0dbf6-37ff-4651-9519-bb184cd8af75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "545461ade05d53274198c0391e23171c4e0bb093efdd8bad22164cfb50c87e30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b07d47c-287f-42cb-ad2f-d42b43cb44d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09c971ee7a397325104c96f6accc1797ca53afa44df6694c9f126104b8f7feb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "316 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nhave purchased, and how much they have spent since becoming a customer. Suppose the company is \noffering a leather jacket. It might make this offer to the most attractive customers\u2014those who made \ntheir last purchase between 30 and 60 days ago, who make three to six purchases a year, and who have \nspent at least $100 since becoming customers. Points are established for varying RFM levels; the more \npoints, the more attractive the customer.41\nThe company\u2019s best prospects are customers who have bought its products in the past. The direct \nmarketer can also buy lists of names from list brokers, but these lists often have problems, including \nname duplication, incomplete data, and obsolete addresses. Better lists include overlays of demographic \nand psychographic information. Direct marketers typically buy and test a sample before buying more \nnames from the same list. They also can build their own lists by advertising a promotional offer and \ncollecting responses.42\nOne of the great advantages of direct marketing is the ability to test, under real marketplace con -\nditions, different elements of an offer strategy, such as products, product features, copy platform, \nmailer type, envelope, prices, or mailing lists. The Teaching Company mails 50 million catalogs and \nsends 25\u00a0million e-mails to sell educational lectures and courses. Every element of the offer is tested. \n Replacing an image of Michelangelo\u2019s hand of God with one depicting the ruins of Petra improved \nsales by more than 20 percent.43\nResponse rates typically understate a campaign\u2019s long-term impact. Suppose only 2 percent of the \nrecipients who receive a direct-mail piece advertising Samsonite luggage place an order. A much larger \npercentage became aware of the product (direct mail has high readership), and some percentage may have \nformed an intention to buy at a later date (either by mail or at a retail outlet). Some may mention  Samsonite \nluggage to others as a result of the direct-mail piece. To better estimate a promotion\u2019s impact, some com -\npanies measure the impact of direct marketing on awareness, intention to buy, and word of mouth.\nDirect mail can involve regular mail or e-mail. E-mail allows marketers to inform and commu -\nnicate with customers at a fraction of the cost of regular mail. E-mails can be very productive selling \ntools. The rate at which they prompt purchase has been estimated to be at least three times that of social \nmedia ads. To be effective, e-mails must be timely, targeted, and relevant. The Gilt Groupe sends more \nthan 3,000 variations of its daily e-mail for its flash-sale site based on recipients\u2019 past click-throughs, \nbrowsing history, and purchase history.44\nPrivacy concerns are growing\u2014many consumers refuse to share any personal details with brands \neven if doing so would bring them better targeted offers and discounts. Some firms are asking consum -\ners to indicate whether and when they would like to receive e-mails. FTD, the flower retailer, allows \ncustomers to choose whether to receive e-mail reminders to send flowers for virtually any holiday, as \nwell as specific birthdays and anniversaries.\nCatalog Marketing.  Companies using catalog marketing may send full-line merchandise \ncatalogs, specialty consumer catalogs, and business catalogs, usually in print form but also online. \n Thousands of small businesses also issue specialty catalogs. Many direct marketers find combining cat -\nalogs and websites an effective way to sell. For example, W.W. Grainger every year publishes a massive, \nnearly 3000-page printed catalog, while at the same time posting a digital, searchable version of the \ncatalog online along with supplemental content that goes beyond the printed version of the catalog.45\nCatalogs are a huge business.

In addition, \nmany chain stores have dropped slower-moving specialty items, creating an opportunity for direct \nmarketers to promote these to interested buyers instead.\nSellers can benefit from direct marketing as well. Direct marketers can buy a list containing the \nnames of almost every group imaginable: left-handed people, tall people, millionaires, or you-name-it. \nThey can customize and personalize messages and build a continuous relationship with each customer. \nNew parents inevitably receive periodic mailings describing new clothes, toys, and other goods as their \nchild grows.\nDirect marketing can reach prospects at the moment when they want a solicitation, so they are \nnoticed by more highly interested prospects. It lets marketers test alternative media and messages to \nfind the most cost-effective approach. Direct marketing also makes the company\u2019s offer and strategy \nless visible to competitors. Finally, direct marketers can measure responses to their campaigns to decide \nwhich have been the most profitable.\nDirect marketing must be integrated with other communications and channel activities. Eddie \nBauer, Lands\u2019 End, and the Franklin Mint made fortunes building their brands in the direct marketing \nmail-order and phone-order business before opening retail stores. They cross-promote their stores, \ncatalogs, and websites\u2014for example, by putting their internet addresses on their shopping bags.\nSuccessful direct marketers view a customer interaction as an opportunity to up-sell, cross-sell, or just \ndeepen a relationship. They make sure they know enough about each customer to customize and personal -\nize offers and messages and develop a plan for lifetime marketing to each valuable customer, based on their \nknowledge of life events and transitions. They also carefully orchestrate each element of their campaigns.<< TV infomercials \nhave been used with \ngreat success to sell the \nGeorge Foreman grill, \nbacked by the former \nheavyweight boxing \nchampion.\nSource: HO rST OSSINGE r/EPA/Newscom", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85bbe49c-0144-438c-a35f-dfeac4ab3736": {"__data__": {"id_": "85bbe49c-0144-438c-a35f-dfeac4ab3736", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b722ed23-6750-4ebe-8c04-b0b867586f9a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "8f29d05e0fdc265ec753aca98547479c90943aca974b4f4364c9dd6057b79663", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40a0d656-cd38-4575-9b60-541fbafba494", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap14.pdf"}, "hash": "0ee3275d5d5f9c3054f47195a28bf1cc3c5d69d18f129a884b4858d0b56c2d57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3002fdf4-fe1b-4908-96a1-e6a69908d803", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68d3b8cf034f8b37ab14981e4d620fe2d0cf8e141b5f54ddf4abaaeab5dacc14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "318 PART  5   |  COMMUNICATING VALUE\nselling, servicing, information gathering, and allocat -\ning.

To estimate how \nlarge the sales force needs to be, the firm estimates the \ntotal workload and how many sales hours (and hence \nsalespeople) will be needed. Compensating sales reps \nrequires deciding what types of salaries, commissions, \nbonuses, expense accounts, and benefits to give and \nhow much weight customer satisfaction should have in \ndetermining total compensation.\n5.

Direct \nmarketers can use a number of channels to reach \nindividual prospects and customers: direct mail, \ncatalog marketing, telemarketing, kiosks, websites, \nand mobile devices. They often seek a measurable \nresponse, typically a customer order, through direct-\norder marketing.7. Major direct marketing channels  include direct mail, catalog \nmarketing, telemarketing, and infomercials.

But the \ncompany faced increasingly stiff competition both interna-\ntionally and at home. Multinationals like P&G and Unilever \nmade inroads in developing nations, while department and \ndrug stores expanded their selection of affordable cosmetics, \nand retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora appeared. While \nUlta\u2019s sales rose from $1.45 billion to $3.2 billion between \n2010 and 2014, Avon\u2019s North American sales fell from \n$2.2\u00a0billion to $1 billion during that time.\nOne of the reasons for the decline in Avon\u2019s market share \nwas that the company was slow to pick up on the prolifera -\ntion of online marketing and social networking. Only in 2014 \ndid Avon attempt to refurbish its website, which hadn\u2019t had a \nmakeover in a decade, and create marketing materials specifi -\ncally for its Hispanic reps, who far outsold their non-Hispanic \ncounterparts. Social media and online selling were becoming \nmore important as face-to-face contact became increasingly \ndifficult in a world where women make up almost 50 percent of \nthe workforce. In addition, Millennials, a rapidly growing market \nwith annual spending power estimated to reach $1.4 trillion \nby 2020, preferred online to in-home events and were paying \nattention to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter influencers\u2014the \ntype of social media marketing that Avon had failed to facilitate.Avon\nAvon, the world\u2019s oldest direct-sales beauty company, got \nits start in 1886 after door-to-door book salesman David \n McConnell began offering free perfume to attract female \n customers. When the perfume proved more popular, \n McConnell ditched the books and started the  California \nPerfume Company, which his son later renamed after \n Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace. McConnell hired 50-year-old  \nMrs. P. F. E Albee to peddle perfume and recruit a sales team, \ngiving women one of the first opportunities to work outside \nthe home and earn an income in an era when this was far \nfrom the norm.

Founded in 1937, the company is considered one \nof the most innovative insurance agencies in the industry. \nFrom the beginning, Progressive\u2019s philosophy has been to \napproach auto insurance \u201clike no other company had.\u201d\nProgressive attracts new customers through its unique \nproduct offerings and services. For example, it was the \nfirst insurance company to offer drive-thru claim service, \n24-hour claim service, and reduced rates for low-risk driv -\ners. In 1994, Progressive introduced a comparison insur -\nance shopping service, encouraging customers to call \n800-AUTO-P rO (now 800-P rOGrESSIVE) and receive \na Progressive quote as well as comparison quotes from \nthree competitors. Progressive extended this service \nwhen it launched comparison-rate shopping on the inter -\nnet.  Progressive was also the first insurance company to \nintroduce the Immediate response Vehicle (I rV), a special \nvehicle that brings trained claims professionals to wherever \ncustomers need them, including the scene of an accident. \nIn 2015, Avon split its operations by selling most of its \nNorth American business to private investment firm Cerberus \nHoldings (its U.S., Canada, and Puerto rico businesses now \noperate as \u201cNew Avon LLC\u201d) and moving its headquarters \nto London. By 2017, Avon\u2019s stock market value had fallen \nto $1.3 billion\u2014a dramatic decline from its over $21 billion \nmarket valuation a little more than a decade earlier. Many of \nthe causes sprang from an unclear marketing strategy that \ndated from the early 2000s, which saw Avon straddling the \nline between direct sales and retailing, having difficulty imple-\nmenting a workable software platform that could facilitate the \ntransition to online sales, engaging in a number of corporate \nrestructurings that were more about cost-cutting than stra-\ntegic vision, and facing regulatory challenges in the rapidly \ngrowing Chinese market.\nrealizing that Avon had lost its way and needed to step \nup its ability to capitalize on emerging trends and opportuni -\nties in order to grow and prosper, Jan Zijderveld, the former \npresident of Unilever\u2019s European business unit who became \nAvon\u2019s CEO in February 2018, partnered with Salesforce.com \nand announced an investment of approximately $300\u00a0  million \nin IT, new products, and marketing, training, and digital \ntools. To bring Avon into the digital age, chief beauty and \nbrand officer James Thompson, formerly with Diageo, \nresolved to intensify ongoing training for reps on how to use \nFacebook and Instagram platforms effectively, in addition \nto growing Avon\u2019s own platform that connects direct online purchases with reps. Avon also appointed its first-ever chief \ndigital  officer to develop personalized beauty apps that link \n customers with reps via a phone camera and focus on data \nanalytics to take the guesswork out of cosmetics purchases. \nBy building on its direct-selling roots, while embracing new \ntechnologies and the changes in the way consumers social-\nize, exchange information, and shop, Avon is seeking to \nrevamp its business model and regain its market position.\nIn January 2020, Avon was acquired by Natura &Co, a \nBrazilian multinational cosmetics and personal care com-\npany, creating the world\u2019s fourth-largest pure-play beauty \ncompany. The acquisition adds Avon to Natura &Co portfolio \nof brands which, in addition to the company\u2019s own brand \nNature, includes The Body Shop and Aesop. The acquisition \nenabled Natura &Co to gain leading position in relationship \nselling, on and offline, with over 6.3 million consultants and \nrepresentatives for the Avon and Natura brands.49\nQuestions\n1.

Policy holders can \nchoose to bring their damaged vehicle to a Progressive ser -\nvice center or can call Progressive roadside assistance to take \ncare of problems ranging from flat tires to locksmith needs.\nConsumers have responded positively to Progressive\u2019s \nmarketing campaigns in recent years, thanks to the com-\npany\u2019s iconic character named Flo. Flo is a quirky, witty, ani-\nmated Progressive employee dressed in a white uniform and \nwhite apron that bears the company\u2019s logo. She represents \nthe Progressive brand and its employees. The Flo commer -\ncials are often set in an imaginary insurance superstore and \naimed at consumers who are considering a new insurance \npolicy or changing insurers. The company has found that \nusing a person to represent Progressive insurance helps \nconsumers envision the intangible act of buying and sell-\ning insurance as a tangible one. Progressive often includes \na white-and-blue \u201cinsurance package\u201d in its commercials \nas well. Again, this reinforces the concept that Progressive \nsells something concrete rather than something abstract. In \nevery commercial, Flo goes out of her way to help customers \nand their businesses. She works alongside plumbers, lugs \nshrubbery with landscapers, and finds stranded cars and \ndrivers in pouring rain. Flo, her packages of insurance, and \nthe  Progressive supercenters have all helped differentiate \nProgressive in a competitive industry.\nFlo has become one of the most recognized advertis-\ning icons in marketing today and has made \u201cProgressive\u201d a \nhousehold name. However, Progressive\u2019s marketing team is \ncareful to keep her modern and relevant. She appears across \nall types of screens\u2014including those on TVs, computers, \nmobile devices, smartphone apps, video games like Sims \nSocial, and animated YouTube videos. She even has her own \nFacebook page (along with millions of fans). Progressive\u2019s \nmarketing has also won multiple awards, including Adweek\u2019s  \n\u201cBrand Genius: Marketer of the Year Award\u201d and an Effie \naward for marketing efficiency.\nProgressive is a leader in using technology to streamline \nthe process of selling insurance.
