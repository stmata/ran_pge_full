Often referred to as its core purpose , a company\u2019s mission is a long-term goal that provides com -\npany employees and management with a shared sense of purpose, direction, and opportunity.2\nTo define its mission, a company should address Peter Drucker\u2019s classic questions:3 What is our \nbusiness? Who is the customer? What is of value to the customer? What will our business be? What \nshould our business be? These simple-sounding questions are among the most difficult a company will \never face. Successful companies continuously ask and answer them.\nA clear, thoughtful mission statement, developed collaboratively with managers, employees, and \noften customers, provides a shared sense of purpose, direction, and opportunity. At its best, it reflects a \nvision, an almost \u201cimpossible dream,\u201d that provides direction for the next 10 to 20 years. Sony\u2019s former \npresident, Akio Morita, wanted everyone to have access to \u201cpersonal portable sound,\u201d so his company \ncreated the Walkman and the portable CD player. Fred Smith wanted to deliver mail anywhere in the \nUnited States before 10:30 am the next day, so he created FedEx.\nConsider the following mission statements:\nGoogle\u2019s mission is to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and \nuseful.4\nAt IKEA our vision is to create a better everyday life for the many people.

Narrowing the range of individual \ndiscretion lets employees act consistently on important issues.\n\u2022 They define the major markets that the company aims to serve.  Because the choice of tar -\nget market defines a company\u2019s strategy and tactics, it should be defined by and follow from the \ncompany\u2019s mission statement.\n\u2022 They take a long-term view.

Three- to four-word corporate \nmantras are typically more effective than long-winded mission statements.\nBUILDING THE CORPORATE CULTURE\nStrategic planning happens within the context of the organization. A company\u2019s organization consists \nof its structures, policies, and corporate culture, all of which can become dysfunctional in a rapidly \nchanging business environment. Whereas managers can change structures and policies (though with \ndifficulty), the company\u2019s culture is very hard to change.

A strategic business unit (SBU)  has three characteristics: \n(1) It is a single business, or a collection of related businesses, that can exist separately from the rest of \nthe company; (2) It has its own set of competitors; and (3) It has a manager responsible for strategic \nplanning and profit performance, who controls most of the factors affecting profit.\nStrategic business units make up a company\u2019s portfolio. Based on the diversity of the individual \nstrategic business units within the portfolio, these units can be defined as specialized or diversified.\nA specialized portfolio  involves SBUs with fairly narrow assortments consisting of one or a few \nproduct lines. To illustrate, Ferrari (high-performance sports cars), Glac\u00e9au (bottled water), GoPro \n(action camcorders), and Roku (digital media streaming) have strategically limited their product mix \nto a fairly narrow product line.Southwest Airlines  Established in 1967, Southwest Airlines continues to differentiate \nitself from other airlines with outstanding customer service. At the core of this service is the \ncompany\u2019s culture, which inspires its more than 58,000 employees to delight the airline\u2019s \npassengers. By creating an inclusive and fun culture where every team member feels responsible \nfor the success of company, Southwest motivates employees to take pride in their work, which \noften translates into a superior customer experience. In fact, Southwest ranks its employees \nfirst in importance, followed by customers and company shareholders. The airline explains its \ncompany culture: \u201cWe believe that if we treat our employees right, they will treat our customers \nright, and in turn that results in increased business and profits that make everyone happy.\u201d This \nsupportive environment has helped Southwest create a loyal customer base and become the \nnation\u2019s largest domestic air carrier\u2014a ranking it has maintained since 2003.10<< Southwest Airlines\u2019 \nresolve to stand out from \nother airlines is based on \nproviding a supportive, \ninclusive, and fun com-\npany culture. \nSource: Richard Ellis/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3085, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddc3a6e5-6f6c-49e4-b0ce-a7c8f2c6bd46": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddc3a6e5-6f6c-49e4-b0ce-a7c8f2c6bd46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "681400f0-fcdc-4f77-bd1a-fb4503feef90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "d24dc5556efcf7901cc42b33a9482ac4fbf04866d2d8b5800c921101c2607582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e65fdd31-03f2-42ac-8129-8887c3f51dac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "deecdbb953eb8d41d35a98b88e7597715736ccf7a0c2dff2990341c789ac5882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc460c77-decf-4bd8-b016-00693d875492", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "21e7577708552e7473a23f7a6f4b3e2462c3674e762af84cbad1d628643a47a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "32 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nIn contrast, a diversified portfolio  involves SBUs with fairly broad assortments containing mul -\ntiple product lines. For example, companies like Amazon, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, and \nUnilever offer a wide variety of product lines. The primary rationale for a diversified business mix is to \ntake advantage of growth opportunities in areas in which the company has no presence.\nEach business unit needs to define its specific mission within the broader company mission. Thus, \na company that manufactures and markets lighting equipment for television studios might define its \nmission as \u201cTo target major television studios and become their vendor of choice for lighting tech -\nnologies that represent the most advanced and reliable studio lighting arrangements.\u201d Note that this \nmission statement does not mention winning business from smaller television studios, offering the \nlowest price, or venturing into non-lighting products.\nThe purpose of identifying the company\u2019s strategic business units is to develop separate strate -\ngies and assign appropriate funding. Senior management knows its portfolio of businesses usually \nincludes a number of \u201cyesterday\u2019s has-beens\u201d as well as \u201ctomorrow\u2019s winners.\u201d Liz Claiborne has \nput more emphasis on some of its younger businesses, such as Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand Jeans, \nMexx, and Kate Spade, while selling businesses without the same buzz (Ellen Tracy, Sigrid Olsen, \nand Laundry).\nALLOCATING RESOURCES ACROSS BUSINESS UNITS\nOnce it has defined its SBUs, management must decide how to allocate corporate resources to each \nunit.12 This is often done by assessing each SBU\u2019s competitive advantage and the attractiveness of the \nmarket in which it operates. When assessing individual business units, a company might also consider \nexisting synergies among them. Such synergies can be related to company processes (e.g., research and \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and distribution) or to personnel (e.g., experienced management, qualified \nengineers, and knowledgeable sales force). Based on the assessment of its portfolio of business units, the \ncompany could decide whether to grow, \u201charvest\u201d (or draw cash from), or hold on to a particular business.\nPortfolio management focuses on two types of factors: (1) opportunities presented by a particular \nindustry or market and (2) the company\u2019s resources, which determine its ability to take advantage of the \nidentified opportunities. Here, market opportunities are typically defined in terms of overall  market/\nindustry attractiveness factors such as its size, growth, and profitability. A company\u2019s resources, on \nthe other hand, reflect its competitive position in the marketplace and are often measured in terms of \nfactors such as strategic assets, core competencies, and market share.\nBecause the principles for making resource-allocation decisions across different business units \nare very similar across industries, many companies have developed generalized strategies for making \nsuch decisions. These generalized strategies are often integrated into formal portfolio models that offer \nguidance on how to allocate resources across multiple SBUs.\nKraft  To account for the varying rates of growth of its different business units and the \ndifferences in their strategic goals, strategies, and tactics, Kraft split into two businesses: a fast-\ngrowing global snacks and candy business that includes Oreo cookies and Cadbury candy, and \na slower-growing North American grocery business with long-term stalwarts Maxwell House \ncoffee, Planters peanuts, Kraft cheese, and Jell-O. The snacks and candy business was branded \nas Mondel\u0113z International and positioned as a high-growth company with many opportunities in \nemerging markets such as China and India. The grocery business retained the Kraft Foods name \n(now KraftHeinz), and, because it consisted of many category-dominant meat and cheese brands, \nit was seen as more of a cash cow for investors interested in consistent dividends. Mondel\u0113z \nhas ramped up for rapid expansion, while Kraft Foods has focused on cost-cutting and selective \ninvestment to back up its power brands.13\nA key aspect in developing portfolio models involves identifying the metrics underlying the per -\nformance of a given business unit. Depending on the assumptions of the model, these metrics can \ninclude factors such as return on investment, market share, and industry growth rate. One widely \nused\u2014albeit somewhat oversimplified and subjective\u2014approach to portfolio analysis is the BCG \nmatrix developed by the Boston Consulting Group. Newer portfolio-management methods use a more \ncomprehensive approach to assess the potential of a business based on growth opportunities from \nglobal expansion, repositioning or retargeting, and strategic outsourcing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4863, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc460c77-decf-4bd8-b016-00693d875492": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc460c77-decf-4bd8-b016-00693d875492", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ab105bd-466e-49e5-a4b2-4b6c166438f2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "74b7f3b9f8dcea4903295430a44a8deb02e7b88217fc039ee1d424da6259333a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddc3a6e5-6f6c-49e4-b0ce-a7c8f2c6bd46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "d24dc5556efcf7901cc42b33a9482ac4fbf04866d2d8b5800c921101c2607582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be2a8164-22ec-4e86-b597-21450a521dfc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5468db36506e9b16f8211798d6b752f9ea2a17b1468845472f19656ba3b03eb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 2    |  MARKETING  PLANNING  AND \u00a0MANAGEMENT  33\nDeveloping Market Offerings\nIn order to create value for target customers, collaborators, and company stakeholders, it is necessary \nfor a company to clearly identify the target market in which it will compete and to design an offering \nthat will deliver a meaningful set of benefits to target customers.14 These activities encompass the \ntwo key components of a company\u2019s business model: strategy and tactics.\nStrategy  involves choosing a well-defined market in which the company will compete and deter -\nmining the value it intends to create in this market. Tactics , also called the marketing mix, make the \ncompany\u2019s strategy come alive: They define the key aspects of the offering developed to create value in a \ngiven market. The tactics logically follow from the company\u2019s strategy and reflect the way the company \nwill make this strategy a market reality. Tactics shape everything from the offering\u2019s benefits and costs \nto the means by which target customers learn about and buy the offering.\nStrategy and tactics are fundamentally intertwined. A company\u2019s strategy specifies the target mar -\nket and the value the company aims to create in this market, while the tactics detail the actual attributes \nof the offering that will create value in the chosen market. Deciding on the specific tactical aspects of \nan offering\u2014its features, brand image, and pricing, and the means of promoting, communicating, and \ndistributing the offering\u2014is not possible without understanding the needs of the target marketing and \nthe competing options that exist to fulfill these needs.\nThe key aspects of an offering\u2019s strategy and tactics are discussed in more detail in the following \nsections.\nDEVELOPING THE MARKETING STRATEGY\nMarketing strategy incorporates two key components: the target market  in which the company will \ncompete and the value proposition  for the relevant market entities\u2014the company, its target customers, \nand its collaborators.

The central placement of target customers \nin the 5-C framework reflects their defining role in the market. The other three market entities\u2014the \ncompany, its collaborators, and its competitors\u2014work to create value for the target customers. Form -\ning the outer layer of the 5C framework is the market context, which defines the environment in which \ncustomers, the company, collaborators, and competitors operate.\nThe Five Cs and the relationships among them are discussed in more detail in the following \nsections.\n\u2022 Target customers  are the individuals or organizations whose needs the company plans to fulfill. \nTarget customers in business-to-consumer markets are typically the end users of the company\u2019s \nofferings, whereas in business-to-business markets, target customers are other businesses that \nuse the company\u2019s offerings. Two key principles determine the choice of target customers: The \ncompany and its collaborators must be able to create superior value for target customers relative to \nthe competition, and the target customers chosen should be able to create value for the company \nand its collaborators.\n\u2022 Collaborators  work with the company to create value for target customers. A company should \nbase the choice of collaborators on the complementary resources they can offer to help the com -\npany fulfill customer needs. Collaboration involves outsourcing (rather than developing) the \nresources that the company lacks but that it requires to create an offering that fulfills the needs \nof target customers. Instead of building or acquiring resources that are lacking, a company can \ngain access to necessary resources by partnering with entities that have them and can benefit \nfrom sharing them. Collaborators can include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors (i.e., dealers, \nwholesalers, and retailers), research-and-development entities, service providers, external sales \nforces, advertising agencies, and marketing research companies.\n\u2022 Competitors  aim to fulfill the same needs of the same customers that the company is targeting.15 \nCompanies should avoid falling prey to the myopic view of competition that defines their rivals \nusing traditional category and industry terms.16 A company should examine the main competi -\ntors and their strategies by asking the following questions: What is each competitor seeking in the \nmarketplace? What drives each competitor\u2019s behavior? This helps clarify the company\u2019s position \nsince many factors are involved a competitor\u2019s objectives, including its size, history, current man -\nagement, and financial situation. For example, it\u2019s important to know whether a competitor that \nis a division of a larger company is being run for growth or for profits, or is just being milked.17\n\u2022 The company  develops and manages a given market offering. For organizations with diverse \nstrategic competencies and market offerings, the term company  typically refers to the particular \nbusiness unit that manages a specific offering. Each strategic business unit can be viewed as a \nseparate company that requires its own business model. For example, GE, Alphabet (Google\u2019s \nparent company), and Facebook have multiple strategic business units.\n\u2022 The context  is the environment in which the company and its collaborators operate. It encom -\npasses five factors. The sociocultural context  is characterized by social and demographic trends, value \nsystems, religion, language, lifestyles, attitudes, and beliefs. The technological context  consists of new \ntechniques, skills, methods, and processes for developing, communicating, and delivering market \nofferings. The regulatory context  includes taxes, import tariffs, and embargoes, as well as product \nspecification and pricing, communication regulations, and intellectual property laws. The economic \ncontext  is made up of economic growth, money supply, inflation, and interest rates.

Accordingly, it defines \ncompetitors in terms of their ability to fulfill customer \nneeds and create market value. The 5-C framework is not \nconcerned with whether the company and its competitors \noperate within the same industry, which makes the \nconcept of substitutes superfluous because from a \ncustomer\u2019s point of view, substitutes are merely cross-\ncategory competitors that aim to fulfill a particular need.\nThe Five Forces framework\u2019s focus on industry \nmakes it particularly relevant for marketers analyzing the \ncompetitive structure within a given industry. However, \nthe Five Forces approach has much less relevance when \nit comes to analyzing an offering\u2019s ability to create market \nvalue. In this case, the 5-C framework is typically more \nuseful because of its customer focus and its market \nperspective based on customer needs rather than on a \nparticular industry.19The Five-C framework is similar to the Five Forces \nframework originated by Michael Porter.18 The Five \nForces framework identifies industry competitiveness \naccording to five factors: the bargaining power of \nsuppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of \nnew entrants, the threat of substitutes, and rivalry among \nexisting competitors. These five factors jointly define \nthe competitive environment in which a firm operates. \nThe Five Forces framework suggests that competition \nwithin an industry increases along with greater bargaining \npower of suppliers and buyers, a higher threat of new \ncompetitors and substitute products, and intensified \nrivalry among existing competitors.\nThe Five Forces framework is similar to the 5-C \nframework in that both are meant to facilitate analysis of \nthe market in which a company operates. The difference \nbetween these frameworks is the way in which each \ndefines the market. The Five Forces framework analyzes \nthe competition in the market from an industry perspective. The Five Cs and the Five Forces of CompetitionMany recent developments\u2014including the advancements in artificial intelligence, the initiation \nof trade wars, global warming, and the coronavirus pandemic\u2014have forced many companies to \ncompletely rethink the way they operate and pivot their business models.\nThe key component of the target market is the selection of target customers, which determines all \nother aspects of the market: This includes specifying the competition, choosing collaborators, defining \nthe company resources needed to develop a superior offering for customers, and outlining the context \nin which the company will create market value. It follows that a change in target customers typically \nleads to a change in competitors and collaborators, different resource requirements, and a change in \ncontext factors. Because of its strategic importance, the choice of the right target customers is the \nfoundation for building a successful business model.\nDeveloping a Value Proposition.  A successful offering must create superior value not only \nfor target customers but also for the company and its collaborators. Accordingly, when developing \nmarket offerings for the relevant entities in the market exchange, a company needs to consider all three \ntypes of value: customer value, collaborator value, and company value.\n\u2022 Customer value  is the worth of an offering to its customers and hinges on customers\u2019 assessment \nof how well an offering fulfills their needs. The value that an offering creates for its customers is \nbased on three main factors: the needs  of the target customers, the benefits customers receive and \nthe costs they incur when they purchase the company\u2019s offering, and the benefits and costs of the \nalternative means\u2014competitive offerings\u2014that target customers can use to fulfill their needs. \nThus, the customer value proposition should be able to explain why target customers would \nchoose the company\u2019s offering instead of the available alternatives.\n\u2022 Collaborator value  is the worth of an offering to the company\u2019s collaborators. It sums up all \nbenefits and costs that an offering creates for collaborators and reflects how attractive an offering \nis to collaborators. The collaborator value proposition should explain why collaborators would \nchoose the company\u2019s offering instead of competitive alternatives to achieve their goals.\n\u2022 Company value  is the worth of the offering to the company. The value of an offering is defined \nrelative to all benefits and costs associated with it, its affinity with the company\u2019s goal(s), and the \nvalue of other opportunities that could be pursued by the company\u2014for example, other offerings \nthat the company could launch. Therefore, the company value proposition determines why the \ncompany would choose this offering instead of selecting alternative options.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4967, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "714b0785-5278-4123-871b-5289621981ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "714b0785-5278-4123-871b-5289621981ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d548cdf3-2bb2-404e-a520-2123cf8164ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "5de54d8d3636d70ab22cf6afa4045a07b996f6a1a482bc55e85c168156daf3b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "431d65e7-2e03-4957-b58d-c2fd4e88b98a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "59f0ceb85a70c173d4309d1165c63eddcab5dde14d0e9e4cbdbb6b97d741ecb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0cf889e-3296-4a0d-8321-40ceab9a4c1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94fa64ee532538f35e31e142236bb2e344d1451b39d0e6434f3e2048db73b92f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "36 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nThe market value principle is also referred to as the 3-V principle because it underscores the \nimportance of creating value for the three key market entities\u2014target customers, collaborators, and \nthe company itself. The market value principle defines the viability of a business model by posing three \nsets of questions that must be addressed:\nWhat value does the offering create for target customers? Why would target customers choose this \noffering? What makes this offering superior to the alternative options?\nWhat value does the offering create for the company\u2019s collaborators (suppliers, distributors, and  \nco-developers)? Why would collaborators partner with the company instead of with other entities?\nWhat value does the offering create for the company? Why should the company invest resources in this \noffering rather than pursuing other options?\nThe need to manage value for all three of these market entities begs the question of which value \nto prioritize. This requires the creation of an optimal value proposition  that balances the value for \ncustomers, collaborators, and the company. The term optimal value  as used here means that the value of \nthe offering is connected across the three entities, such that it creates value for target customers and col -\nlaborators in a way that enables the company to achieve its strategic goals. The market value principle \noptimizes customer, collaborator, and company value and is the basis of market success (Figure 2.3). \nFailure to create superior value for any of the three market entities inevitably leads to an unsustainable \nbusiness model and dooms the business venture.\nConsider the means that Starbucks uses to create market value. Customers receive the functional \nbenefit of a variety of coffee beverages and the psychological benefit of expressing their personality \nby choosing a customized beverage, for which they deliver monetary compensation to Starbucks. \nCollaborators (coffee growers) receive monetary payments from Starbucks for the coffee beans they \nprovide and derive the strategic benefit of having a consistent demand for their product; in return, \nthey invest resources in growing coffee beans that conform to Starbucks\u2019 standards. Starbucks receives \nrevenues and profits from investing company resources in developing and offering its products and \nservices to consumers, in addition to deriving the strategic benefits of building a brand and enhancing \nits market footprint.\nDESIGNING THE MARKETING TACTICS\nThe market offering  is the actual good that the company deploys in order to fulfill a particular cus -\ntomer need. Unlike the target market and the value proposition, which reflect the company\u2019s strategy, \nthe market offering reflects the company\u2019s tactics\u2014the specific way the company will create value in \nthe market in which it competes.\nMarketing managers have seven tactics at their disposal to develop an offering that creates mar -\nket value: product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and distribution. Also called the \nmarketing mix , these seven attributes (also referred to as tactics or Ts) represent the combination of \nactivities required to transform the market offering\u2019s strategy into reality (Figure 2.4).\nThe seven attributes that delineate the market offering are as follows:\n\u2022 The product  is a marketable commodity that aims to create value for target customers. Products \ncan be tangible (like food, apparel, and furniture) or intangible (like music and software). Pur -\nchase of a product gives customers ownership rights to the acquired good. For example, with the \npurchase of a car or a software program, the owner is granted all rights to the acquired product.\n\u2022 The service  also aims to create value for its customers, but it does so without entitling them to \nownership. Examples of services include appliance repairs, movie rental, medical procedures, \nand tax preparation. At times, the same offering can be positioned as a product or a service.

The Rolls-Royce brand identifies the cars manu -\nfactured by BMW subsidiary Rolls-Royce to differentiate these cars from those made by Bentley, \nMaserati, and Bugatti, as well as to evoke a distinct emotional reaction from its customers, who \nuse the Rolls-Royce brand to call attention to their wealth and socioeconomic status.\n\u2022 The price  is the monetary charge that customers and collaborators incur to receive the benefits \nprovided by the company\u2019s offering.\n\u2022 Incentives  are targeted tools designed to enhance the value of the offering by reducing its costs \nor increasing its benefits. Incentives are typically offered in the form of volume discounts, price \nreductions, coupons, rebates, premiums, bonus offerings, contests, and monetary and recogni -\ntion rewards. Incentives can be directed to consumers or to the company\u2019s collaborators\u2014for \nexample, its channel partners.\n\u2022 Communication  apprises target customers, collaborators, and the company stakeholders of the \nspecifics of the offering and where to acquire it.\n\u2022 Distribution  encompasses the channel(s) used to deliver the offering to target customers and \ncompany collaborators.\nAgain, a Starbucks example can illustrate these attributes. Starbucks\u2019 product  includes the variety of \nbeverage and food items available. The service  consists of the assistance that Starbucks offers to custom -\ners before, during, and after purchase. The brand  consists of the Starbucks name and logo, as well as the \nassociations it evokes in customers\u2019 minds. The price  is the amount of money that Starbucks charges \ncustomers for its offerings. Incentives  include promotional tools such as loyalty programs, coupons, and \ntemporary price reductions that provide additional benefits for customers. Communication  consists of \nthe information Starbucks disseminates via advertising, social media, and public relations to inform \nthe public about its offerings. Distribution  includes company-owned stores and company-licensed retail \noutlets that deliver Starbucks\u2019 offerings to its customers.\nThe seven marketing tactics\u2014product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and \ndistribution\u2014can be regarded as a process of designing , communicating , and delivering  customer value. The \nvalue-design aspect of the offering comprises the product, service, brand, price, and incentives, while \ncommunication and distribution form the information-value and delivery-value aspects of the process \n(Figure 2.5). Thus, even though the different tactical attributes play distinct roles in the value-creation \nprocess, they optimize customer value across all three dimensions.\nThe value-creation process can be considered from the perspectives of both the company and the \ncustomer. The company regards value creation as a process of designing , communicating , and delivering  value; \nhowever, the customer looks at the value-creation process from a different perspective, viewing it in FIGURE 2.4 \nMarketing Tactics: The Seven Tactics  \n(7 Ts) Defining the Market Offering\nSource: Alexander Chernev, Strategic Marketing Management: \nTheory and Practice  (Chicago, IL: Cerebellum Press, 2019).\nCustomer\nvalueCompany\nvalue\nOVP\nCollaborator\nvalue\nProduct\nPrice Incentives\nCommunication DistributionService BrandTacticsStrategy\nMarket Offering", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3846, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f66b8e2-ccbb-45fc-ab45-a4cca6ac3390": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f66b8e2-ccbb-45fc-ab45-a4cca6ac3390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "799bac46-2ee8-4e48-930a-60c441270289", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "d1726aede32e6336fd3f630d23e1f95352b45396f9f101d636a157192eb813ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0cf889e-3296-4a0d-8321-40ceab9a4c1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "bdad125d107d54c76607fdf363b59cbabd36abfb9c5d42bd0650922c3fedaff5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20f10db4-8b1f-4adc-98ec-452a8ac488e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8175cea23bc0f927dbf152bbb999fe3f68a275d4d41a7b571ed402423cfc3370", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "38 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nterms of the attractiveness , awareness , and availability  of the offering.20 Attractiveness reflects the benefits and \ncosts that target customers associate with the product, service, brand, price, and incentives aspects of the \noffering. Awareness highlights the methods through which target customers are informed about the spe -\ncifics of the offering. Availability consists of the ways in which target customers can acquire the offering.\nTHE SEVEN T s AND THE FOUR Ps\nThe view of marketing tactics as a process of defining the seven key attributes of an offering can be \nrelated to the widely popular 4-P framework. Introduced in the 1960s, the 4-P framework identifies \nfour key decisions that managers must make when designing an offering: the features to include \nin the product , the price  of the product, the best way to promote  the product, and the retail outlets in \nwhich to place  the product. These four decision areas are represented by the Four Ps: product, price, \npromotion, and place.\nBecause it is simple, intuitive, and easy to remember, the 4-P framework enjoys wide popularity. \nHowever, because of that very simplicity, the 4-P framework has significantly limited relevance in the \ncontemporary business environment. One of its limitations is that it fails to distinguish between the \nproduct and service aspects of the offering, which is a key drawback in today\u2019s service-oriented busi -\nness environment, where a growing number of companies are switching from a product-based to a \nservice-based business model. Another important limitation of the 4-P framework is that it does not \nregard the brand  as a separate factor, instead viewing the brand as part of the product. The product and \nbrand are two distinct aspects of the offering, and each can exist independently of the other. In fact, a \ngrowing number of companies outsource their product manufacturing so they can focus their efforts \non building and managing their brands.\nAnother area in which the 4-P framework comes up short is in its treatment of the term promo -\ntion. Promotion is a broad concept that comprises two distinct promotional activities: incentives,  which \ninclude price promotions, coupons, and trade promotions, and communication , which encompasses \nadvertising, public relations, social media, and personal selling. Incentives and communication make \ndisparate contributions to the value-creation process: Incentives enhance an offering\u2019s value, whereas \ncommunication serves to inform customers about the offering but does not necessarily enhance the \noffering\u2019s value. The 4-P framework\u2019s use of the term promotion  to refer to both of these discrete activi -\nties can obscure the unique role that each plays in creating market value.\nThe limitations of the 4-P framework can be avoided by regarding the offering in terms of seven \nfactors\u2014product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and distribution\u2014instead of four. \nThe four Ps can be easily mapped onto the seven attributes of the 7-T framework: The first P (prod -\nuct) comprises product, service, and brand; price remains the second P; the third P (promotion) is \nexpanded to incentives and communication; and distribution replaces the fourth P (place). Thus, the \n7-T marketing mix represents a more refined version of the 4-P framework, offering a more accurate \nand actionable approach to designing a company\u2019s offering.\nCREATING A MARKET VALUE MAP\nThe two key aspects of a company\u2019s business model\u2014strategy and tactics\u2014can be represented as a \nvalue map that defines the ways in which a company creates market value. The ultimate purpose of \nthe value map is to facilitate the development of a viable business model that can enable the company FIGURE 2.5 \nMarketing Tactics as a Process \nof Designing, Communicating, \nand Delivering Customer Value\nSource: Alexander Chernev, Strategic Marketing \nManagement: Theory and Practice  (Chicago, IL: \nCerebellum Press, 2019).\n Value\nProduct\nPrice Incentives\nCommunication DistributionService BrandDesigning value\nCommunicating value Delivering value", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4136, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20f10db4-8b1f-4adc-98ec-452a8ac488e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "20f10db4-8b1f-4adc-98ec-452a8ac488e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f54317b-c2f2-4f33-8a3c-fa15f104d22f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "e1a121518d42c1983c097206d6a0d194b29e207d17eb7b3744cf0dae3ab1a765", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f66b8e2-ccbb-45fc-ab45-a4cca6ac3390", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "d1726aede32e6336fd3f630d23e1f95352b45396f9f101d636a157192eb813ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "59de515e-53b9-494b-a437-6c0dc40661fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd4f579e15e67235607a1b494e29db8bbd4ed7f591e8ee81b7b112e8c96c4b3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 2    |  MARKETING  PLANNING  AND \u00a0MANAGEMENT  39\nto achieve market success. Thus, the market value map can be thought of as a visual representation \nof the key components of a company\u2019s business model and the ways in which they are related to \none\u00a0another.\nThe market value map mirrors the structure of the business model and contains three key compo -\nnents that define the company\u2019s strategy and tactics\u2014 the target market , the value proposition , and the market \noffering . The target market is, in turn, defined by the Five Cs\u2014customers, collaborators, company, com -\npetitors, and context\u2014with customers playing the key role in defining the market. The value proposi -\ntion then represents the three types of value that the company must create in the market: customer \nvalue, collaborator value, and company value. Finally, the offering component of the market value map \ndelineates the seven key attributes\u2014product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and \ndistribution\u2014that represent the tactical aspect of a company\u2019s business model. The components of the \nmarket value map and the key questions defining each component are shown in Figure 2.6.\nThe value proposition component of the market value map is central to ensuring the viability \nof the company\u2019s business model. The market success of the company\u2019s offering is determined by its \nability to create value for the three key entities: target customers, the company\u2019s collaborators, and the \ncompany itself. Because these entities have distinct needs and require different value propositions, the \nmarketing planning process can be better served by developing a separate value map for each entity. \nThus, in addition to having a single value map, managers might benefit from developing three value \nmaps: a customer value map, a collaborator value map, and a company value map.\nThese three value maps depict the distinct aspects of the company\u2019s business model that concern \nthe key entities involved in the value-creation process. The customer value map  captures the ways in \nwhich the company\u2019s offering will create value for its target customers and outlines the strategic and \ntactical aspects of the customer-focused aspect of the company\u2019s business model. The collaborator \nvalue map  delineates the strategic and tactical aspects of the ways in which the company\u2019s offering \nFIGURE 2.6 \nThe Market Value Map\nSource: Alexander Chernev, \n Strategic Marketing  Management: \nTheory and Practice  (Chicago, IL: \nCerebellum Press, 2019).\nWhat customer need does\nthe company aim to fulfill?\nWho are the customers with this need?What are the key\nfeatures of the company\u2019s product?\nWhat are the key\nfeatures of the company\u2019s service?\nWhat are the key\nfeatures of the offering\u2019s brand?\nWhat is the\noffering\u2019s price?\nWhat incentives\ndoes the offering provide?\nHow will target\ncustomers and collaborators become\naware of the company\u2019s offering?\nHow will the offering\nbe delivered to target customers\nand collaborators?What other entities will\nwork with the company\nto fulfill the identified customer need?\nWhat are the company\u2019s\nresources that will enable\nit to fulfill the identified customer need?\nWhat other offerings aim\nto fulfill the same need of\nthe same target customers?\nWhat are the sociocultural,\ntechnological, regulatory, economic,\nand physical aspects of the environment?\nWhat value does\nthe offering create for target customers?\nWhat value does\nthe offering create\nfor the company\u2019s collaborators?\nWhat value does\nthe offering create for the company?\nStrategy TacticsCompany ValueCollaborator ValueCustomer ValueTarget Market Market Offering\nCustomers Product\nService\nBrand\nPrice\nIncentives\nCommunication\nDistributionCollaborators\nCompany\nCompetition\nContext\nValue Proposition", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3774, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59de515e-53b9-494b-a437-6c0dc40661fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "59de515e-53b9-494b-a437-6c0dc40661fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3dd9f922-b889-4049-b85e-8f15202ba7dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "ef937b14d135bb9464389826e1e20b7083f482e03a4725ea26cd82840ce51b53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20f10db4-8b1f-4adc-98ec-452a8ac488e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "a55a4aa2d7445f87f0ad82023f1887abb90731f5990cac508ee129de818345d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9e97774-26f3-47bd-86f7-b64bf6690e02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d8387d546c19b7124898af328fd06bc93b84af6028ca4488706f7c82b0f0a41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "40 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nwill create value for collaborators. Finally, the company value map  outlines the ways in which the offer -\ning will create value for the company\u2019s stakeholders. Note that these three value maps are intricately \nrelated as they reflect different aspects of the process of creating market value. Only by creating value \nfor target customers, collaborators, and the company can a manager ensure the market success of \nan offering.\nPlanning and Managing Market Offerings\nA company\u2019s future depends on its ability to develop successful market offerings that create superior \nvalue for target customers, the company, and its collaborators.21 Market success typically results from \ndiligent market analysis, planning, and management; rarely is it a lucky accident. Succeeding in the \nmarket requires a company to develop a viable business model and an action plan that allows the \nbusiness model to become a reality. The process of developing such an action plan is encapsulated in \nthe G-STIC framework described in the following sections.\nTHE G-STIC APPROACH TO ACTION PLANNING\nThe action plan, which articulates the company\u2019s goal and delineates a course of action to reach this \ngoal, is the backbone of marketing planning. Five key activities guide the development of an action \nplan: These activities include setting a goal , developing a strategy , designing the tactics , defining an \nimplementation  plan, and identifying a set of control  metrics to measure the success of the proposed \naction. The G-STIC (Goal-Strategy-Tactics-Implementation-Control) framework comprises these five \nactivities and acts as the lynchpin of marketing planning and analysis. At the core of the action plan \nis the business model based on the offering\u2019s strategy and tactics.\nThe individual components of the G-STIC approach to marketing planning and management are \nas follows:\n\u2022 The goal  describes the company\u2019s ultimate criterion for success; it specifies the end result that \nthe company plans to achieve. The two components of the goal are its focus , which defines the \nmetric (such as net income) used to quantify the intended result of the company\u2019s actions, and \nthe performance benchmarks  that signal movement toward the goal and define the time frame for \nachieving the goal.\n\u2022 The strategy  provides the basis for the company\u2019s business model by delineating the company\u2019s \ntarget market  and describing the offering\u2019s value proposition  in this market.\n\u2022 Tactics  carry out the strategy by defining the key attributes of the company\u2019s offering. These seven \ntactics\u2014 product , service , brand , price , incentives , communication , and distribution \u2014are the tools used to \ncreate value in the company\u2019s chosen market.\n\u2022 Implementation  consists of the processes involved in readying the company\u2019s offering for sale. \nImplementation includes developing  the offering and deploying  the offering in the target market.\n\u2022 Control  measures the success of the company\u2019s activities over time by monitoring the company\u2019s \nperformance  and the changes in the market environment  in which the company operates.\nThe key components of the marketing plan and the key factors describing each component are \noutlined in Figure 2.7 and are examined in more detail in the following sections.\nSETTING A GOAL\nDefining the goal that the company aims to achieve sets the marketing plan in motion. The goal can \nbe regarded as the beacon that guides all company activities. Two key decisions are involved in setting \na goal: identifying the focus  of the company\u2019s actions and specifying the performance benchmarks  to be \nachieved. These decisions are discussed in more detail next.\nDefining the Goal Focus.  The goal\u2019s focus defines the desired outcome of the company\u2019s \nactivities, an important criterion of a firm\u2019s success. Based on their focus, goals can be monetary or \nstrategic.\n\u2022 Monetary goals  are based on such outcomes as net income, profit margins, earnings per share, and \nreturn on investment.

Among the most common strategic goals are increasing sales volume, brand awareness, \nand social welfare, as well as enhancing the corporate culture and facilitating employee recruit -\nment and retention. Nonprofit companies and for-profit companies looking to support items \nthat are bigger revenue producers than the focal offering have strategic goals as their main per -\nformance metric. As an example, Amazon might only break even or actually take a loss on some \nof its Kindle devices and yet view them as a strategically important platform for its retail business.\nCompanies are increasingly looking beyond sales revenue and profit to consider the legal, ethical, \nsocial, and environmental effects of their marketing activities and programs. The concept of a \u201ctriple \nbottom line\u201d\u2014people, planet, and profits\u2014has gained traction among many companies taking stock \nof the societal impact of their activities.22 For example, one of Unilever\u2019s key initiatives\u2014its Sustainable \nLiving Plan\u2014has three major goals: to improve people\u2019s health and well-being, to reduce our environ -\nmental impact, and to enhance livelihoods. These goals are underpinned by metrics spanning social, \nenvironmental, and economic performance in the company\u2019s value chain.23\nDefining Performance Benchmarks.  Quantitative and temporal performance benchmarks \nwork in tandem to provide the measurements that track the progress of the company toward reaching \nits established goal.\n\u2022 Quantitative benchmarks  set out the specific milestones to be achieved as the company moves \ntoward its ultimate goal. These benchmarks quantify the company\u2019s focal goal, which might, for \nexample, include increasing market share by 5 percent, or improving retention rates by 15 percent, \nor growing revenues by 10 percent. Quantitative benchmarks can be stated in relative terms, such \nas aiming to increase market share by 20 percent, or in absolute terms, such as aspiring to achieve \nsales of one million units per year.\n\u2022 Temporal benchmarks  identify the time frame for achieving a specific quantitative or  qualitative \nbenchmark\u2014e.g., revamp the company\u2019s website by the end of the first quarter. The timeline set \nfor achieving a goal is a key decision that can affect the type of strategy used to implement the \ngoal, the number of people involved, and even costs. For example, the goal of maximizing next \nquarter\u2019s profits is likely to require a different strategy and tactics than the goal of ensuring long-\nterm profitability.\nImplementing the company goal requires that three main objectives be specified: what  the com -\npany aims to achieve (goal focus), how much  the company wants to achieve (quantitative benchmark), \nand when  the company wants to achieve it (temporal benchmark).

Clearly delineating the goal that is to be achieved and establishing realistic quantitative \nand temporal benchmarks help fine-tune the company\u2019s strategy and tactics.\nDEVELOPING THE STRATEGY\nBecause the processes involved in developing a sound marketing strategy were covered in detail previ -\nously in this chapter, this section contains only a brief mention of strategy in relation to the G-STIC \nframework. The strategy denotes the value that the company intends to create in a particular market \nand includes the company\u2019s target market  and its value proposition  for this market.\n\u2022 The target market  in which the company aims to create value is defined by five factors: customers  \nwhose needs will be fulfilled by the offering, competitors  whose offerings aim to fulfill the same \nneeds of the same target customers, collaborators  that help the company meet the needs of target \ncustomers, the company  managing the offering, and the context  in which the company operates.\n\u2022 The value proposition  defines the benefits and costs of the market offering with which the company \nplans to meet target customers\u2019 needs. The three components of the value proposition are customer \nvalue , collaborator value , and company value . The value proposition is often complemented by a positioning \nstatement  that highlights the key benefit(s) of the company\u2019s offering in a competitive context.\nDESIGNING THE TACTICS\nThe development of marketing tactics was also discussed in greater detail earlier in this chapter, so \nhere we briefly mention tactics as they relate to the G-STIC framework. Tactics, or the marketing mix , \nare a logical sequence of components of the company\u2019s strategy that make this strategy a market real -\nity. They define the actual offering that the company introduces in the target market through seven \nattributes\u2014 product , service , brand , price , incentives , communication , and distribution \u2014that work together to \ncreate the market value embodied by the company\u2019s offering.\nImplementation is a direct outcropping of the company\u2019s strategy and tactics. After the strategy is \ntranslated into a set of tactics, it is converted into an implementation plan that spells out the activities \nthat will give life to the business model. Implementation consists of three key components: development \nof the company resources , development of the offering , and commercial deployment of the offering .\n\u2022 Resource development  entails securing the competencies and assets needed to implement the \ncompany\u2019s offering. Resource development may involve developing manufacturing, service, and \ntechnology infrastructure; securing reliable suppliers ; recruiting, training, and retaining skilled \nemployees; creating products , services , and brands  that serve as a platform for the new offering; \nacquiring the skills necessary for development, production, and management of the offering; \ndeveloping the communication and distribution channels that inform target customers about \nthe company\u2019s offering and make it available to them; and securing the necessary capital to make \nresource development possible.\n\u2022 Development of the offering  transforms the company\u2019s strategy and tactics into an actual good \nthat will be offered to target customers. This involves overseeing the flow of information, mate -\nrials, labor, and money that will create the offering the company brings to the market. Offering \ndevelopment includes designing the product  (procurement, inbound logistics, and production) \nand specifying the service (installation, support, and repair activities); building the brand; setting \nretail and wholesale prices and incentives (coupons, rebates, and price discounts); designing the \nmanner of communication (message, media, and creative execution); and procuring distribution \nchannels (warehousing, order fulfillment, and transportation).\n\u2022 Commercial deployment  is the logical outcome of offering development and establishes the \ncompany\u2019s offering in the market. Deployment includes setting the timing of the offering\u2019s market \nlaunch, as well as determining the resources involved and the scale of the market launch. Initial \ndeployment can be selective, focusing on specific segments of the target market to allow the com -\npany to assess market reaction to the offering. Alternatively, deployment can involve a large-scale \nrollout across all target markets. Selective commercial deployment calls for the marketing plan \nto define the primary market in which the offering will first be introduced and to outline the key \nactivities associated with the offering\u2019s initial launch. The marketing plan then spells out the tim -\ning and the processes involved in expanding the offering beyond the primary market, allowing it \nto reach all target customers and achieve its full market potential.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5000, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "184359cc-45fe-4c9d-a4d1-e48d6758fd2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "184359cc-45fe-4c9d-a4d1-e48d6758fd2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7266555-7034-460b-9a9d-2cf159f1e5db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "0432e397fe2eaf909e758a95764028b985f19f916fa89541e8181c801e1948a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "626ba994-87f2-40f9-a443-294743a254e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "7e3cd03033d92a088ad00e65a8db580316e504a18b84bc47a72781ce2d2ee2da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c8befe2-0e2f-4c7c-8d88-f8f673ece16b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72d9a23192a2abd8db2aae3af67ba13332ef559b8069306951adbc557027bc5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 2    |  MARKETING  PLANNING  AND \u00a0MANAGEMENT  43\nIDENTIFYING CONTROLS\nBecause the business environment undergoes constant change, companies must be agile in order \nto consistently realign their actions with current market realities. Controls steer a company in the \ndirection of its ultimate goal by ensuring that company actions are in line with its strategy and tac -\ntics. Furthermore, controls make marketing operations more effective and cost efficient, and they \nmake it possible to better assess the return on marketing investment by helping companies determine \nwhether they are on the right track to achieve their goals.\nControls have one primary function: to inform the company whether it should stay with its cur -\nrent course of action, modify the underlying strategy and tactics, or completely abandon its current \ncourse of action and develop an offering that better reflects the realities of the market. Controls have \ntwo key components: evaluating the company\u2019s performance  and monitoring the market environment .\nEvaluating Performance.  Evaluating a company\u2019s performance means using benchmarks to \ntrack the company\u2019s progress toward its goal. For example, evaluating a company\u2019s monetary perfor -\nmance might consist of comparing the desired and actual sales revenue outcomes or assessing desired \nand actual net income to identify operational inefficiencies. Here are some common performance \nmeasures:24\n\u2022 Sales metrics such as sales volume, sales growth, and market share\n\u2022 Customer readiness-to-buy metrics such as awareness, preference, purchase intent, trial rate, and \nrepurchase rate\n\u2022 Customer value metrics such as customer satisfaction, customer acquisition costs, customer \nchurn, customer lifetime value, customer profitability, and return per customer\n\u2022 Distribution metrics such as number of outlets, average stock volume, out-of-stock frequency, \nshare of shelf space, and average sales per channel\n\u2022 Communication metrics such as brand awareness, gross rating points (GRP), and response rate\nEvaluating the company\u2019s performance can reveal either adequate progress toward its goal or a \nperformance gap between the desired and the actual performance. If the progress is deemed adequate, \nthe company can stay the course with its current action plan. However, when performance evaluation \nreveals a discrepancy and shows a gap between company performance and the benchmarks set, the \ncompany\u2019s action plan must be reevaluated and modified to put the company back on a path that will \nenable it to achieve its goal.\nMonitoring the Environment.  Monitoring the environment allows early identification of \nchanges in the market context that have implications for the company. It enables the company to take \nadvantage of opportunities such as favorable government regulations, a decrease in competition, or an \nincrease in consumer demand. In addition, it alerts a company of impending threats such as unfavor -\nable government regulations, an increase in competition, or a decline in customer demand.\nWhen a company is vigilant about identifying opportunities and threats, it can take corrective \nmeasures to modify the current action plan in a timely manner, taking advantage of available oppor -\ntunities and counteracting impending threats. Because keeping a close eye on the market environment \nhelps coordinate company actions with market conditions, it enhances business agility, which is a \nprerequisite for sustainability of the company\u2019s value-creation model.\nThe importance of controls in marketing management and, specifically, the significance of \nmonitoring the environment in which the company operates are perhaps best exemplified by the \nprofound market changes stemming from advancements in technology. Companies like Amazon, \nGoogle,  Netflix, Salesforce, Uber, and Express Scripts were among the first to recognize the benefits \nof the various technology-driven innovations and realign their business models to take advantage of \nthe\u00a0impending market changes. Thus, they were able to gain ground on companies that were oblivious \nto the changes in the environment around them.\nDeveloping a Marketing Plan\nThe marketing plan directs and coordinates all company marketing efforts.25 It is a tangible outcome \nof a company\u2019s strategic planning process, outlining the company\u2019s ultimate goal and the means \nby which it aims to achieve this goal.

It includes (1) the goal  the company \naims to achieve; (2) the strategy , which defines the offering\u2019s target market and value proposi -\ntion; (3) the tactics  defining the product, service, brand, price, incentives, communication, and \ndistribution aspects of the offering; (4) the implementation , which lays out the aspects of executing \nan offering\u2019s strategy and tactics; and (5) control  procedures that evaluate the performance of the \ncompany\u2019s offering and analyze the environment in which the company operates.\n\u2022 Exhibits  streamline the marketing plan by keeping tables, charts, and appendices in a distinct \nsection to separate the less important and/or more technical aspects of the plan from the essential \ninformation.\nThe ultimate goal of the marketing plan is to guide a company\u2019s actions. Therefore, the core of the \nmarketing plan is contained in the key elements of the G-STIC framework that delineate the company\u2019s \ngoal and the course of action it proposes. The other elements of the marketing plan\u2014the executive \nsummary, situation overview, and exhibits\u2014elucidate the logic underlying the plan and provide specif -\nics of the proposed course of action.\nIn addition to the overall marketing plan, companies often develop more specialized plans. These \ncan include a product development plan, service management plan, brand management plan, sales \nplan, promotion plan, and communication plan\u2014which, in turn, can breed even more specific plans. \nThe communication plan, for example, often encompasses activity-specific plans such as an adver -\ntising plan, public relations plan, and social media plan. A company might also create specialized \nmarketing plans targeting specific customer segments. For example, McDonald\u2019s develops separate \nmarketing plans targeting young children and their parents, teenagers, and business customers. The \nultimate success of each of these highly specific individual plans depends on the degree to which it is \naligned with the company\u2019s overall marketing plan.\nModifying the Marketing Plan\nMarketing plans are not static; they need updating in order to remain relevant.26 The same is true of \nmarketing management, an iterative process that executes the company\u2019s strategy and tactics while \nmonitoring the outcome and modifying the management process as needed. Continual monitoring \nand adjustment allow the company to assess its progress toward the set goals while tweaking its plan \nto reflect the changes in the marketplace. The dynamic nature of marketing management is inherent \nin the G-STIC framework\u2019s control section, which is crafted explicitly to provide the company with \nfeedback on the effectiveness of its actions and on relevant changes taking place in the target market.\nUPDATING THE MARKETING PLAN\nThe marketing plan requires updating when the company\u2019s current course of action is altered. This \nmay be based on the need to revise the current goal; rethink the existing strategy because new target \nmarkets have been identified or the offering\u2019s overall value proposition for customers, collaborators, \nand the company needs modification; change the tactics by augmenting or improving the product, \nservice, brand, price, incentives, communication, and distribution aspects of the offering; streamline \nthe implementation; and/or develop alternative controls.\nA common reason for updating a company\u2019s marketing plan is in response to changes in the target \nmarket. Market modifications can take place in one or more of the Five Cs: (1) changes in the demo -\ngraphics, buying power, needs, and preferences of target customers; (2) changes in the competitive \nenvironment, such as a new competitor, price cuts, an aggressive advertising campaign, or expanded \ndistribution; (3) changes among company collaborators, such as a threat of backward integration from \ndistributors, increased trade margins, or retailer consolidation; (4) changes in the company, such as \nthe loss of strategic assets and competencies; and (5) changes in the market context that can include \neconomic recession, development of a new technology, and new or revised regulations.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4787, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baee75d4-4641-44b4-a537-c09fb58c647e": {"__data__": {"id_": "baee75d4-4641-44b4-a537-c09fb58c647e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c65d41e-f70e-4123-85d1-9a78a0b84fbc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "b6ca0df947ce7bc4a5331f5dae4e08bb782d041e353a53527231bccce01aa421", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f64dd0e-a23a-4582-b8d6-39af1dbebfb2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "0c8bb25124c97a4684bc94c35522b175c7a791562e05e2db583a79ac656ccdf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3c726c7-f7ca-4ea8-aa3d-c7458f9a4980", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ce0b956c836a09f0b9551d2a2add0233cfb1e732c79de39a8b2a21abd11e10b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "46 PART  1   |  FUNDAMENTALS OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT\nSome examples of updated marketing plans: In response to the shifting needs and preferences of \ntheir customers , McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food restaurants have redefined their offerings to include \nhealthier options. In response to increasing competition  from online retailers, many traditional brick-\nand-mortar retailers\u2014including Walmart, Macy\u2019s, Barnes & Noble, and Best Buy\u2014have redefined their \nbusiness models and become multichannel retailers. Similarly, many manufacturers have redefined \ntheir product lines to include lower-cost offerings in response to the widespread adoption of private \nlabels by collaborators\u2019  (retailers). Developing or acquiring company  assets, such as patents and propri -\netary technologies, can signal the need to redefine the underlying business models in virtually any \nindustry. And changes in the market context, such as the ubiquitous spread of mobile communication, \ne-commerce, and social media, have disrupted existing value-creation processes, making it necessary \nfor companies to redefine their business models.\nThe ways in which a company creates market value must keep up with the changes in the market \nin which it operates if a company is to succeed at achieving its goal. Inattention to changing environ -\nments has rendered a number of formerly successful business models obsolete. Companies that do not \nadapt their business models and market plans to the new market conditions tend to be supplanted by \ncompanies with superior business models that are better equipped to create market value. Ultimately, \nthe key to market success is not only to conceive a viable market plan but also to modify this plan as \noften as needed to adapt to market changes.\nCONDUCTING A MARKETING AUDIT\nA marketing audit is a comprehensive examination of the marketing aspect of an offering or a com -\npany\u2019s marketing department. It is intended to identify overlooked opportunities and problems areas \nand to recommend a plan of action to improve the company\u2019s performance. An effective marketing \naudit should be comprehensive , systematic , unbiased , and periodic .\n\u2022 Comprehensive.  A marketing audit should cover all major marketing activities of a business, not \njust a few trouble spots (these are covered by functional audits, which focus on a particular aspect \nof marketing activity, such as pricing, communication, or distribution). Although functional \naudits can be useful, they may be unable to accurately discern the cause-and-effect relationships \nthat drive the company\u2019s performance. For example, excessive turnover in the sales force could \nresult from inferior company products, inappropriate pricing, and limited distribution, rather \nthan from poor training or inadequate compensation. A comprehensive marketing audit can \nlocate the real root of problems and can suggest solutions to effectively address these problems.\n\u2022 Systematic.  The marketing audit should examine the operating environment of the organization \nin an orderly manner\u2014from the company\u2019s marketing objectives and strategies to its specific \nactivities. To achieve this systematic approach, the marketing audit should follow the G-STIC \nguidelines to analyze the soundness of the company\u2019s goals, strategy, tactics, implementation, and \ncontrols. This enables the marketing audit to identify problems and opportunities at each step of \nthe design and implementation of the marketing plan and to integrate them into a meaningful \naction plan.\n\u2022 Unbiased.  It may be more beneficial to have marketing audits conducted by an external entity. \nIntra-company audits conducted by managers who rate their own operations tend to be overly \nsubjective, making it easier to miss problems that would be readily apparent to a more impartial \nobserver. Even when managers try their best to be impartial, internal assessments may still be \nbiased because they reflect the views, theories, and motives of the managers. Third-party auditors \ncan offer the needed objectivity, cross-category and cross-industry experience, and undivided time \nand attention to ensure a thorough look into marketing activities.\n\u2022 Periodic.  Many firms consider marketing audits only when they encounter a problem, which \noften presents itself in terms of the company\u2019s inability to reach its goals. Waiting until an audit \nis necessary has two main drawbacks. First, focusing solely on existing problems precludes early \nidentification of potential issues. This means problems are detected only when they have already \nhad a negative impact large enough to be noticed. Second, and more important, concentrating \nonly on problems can cause the company to overlook promising opportunities that could repre -\nsent fruitful areas for growth. The bottom line: A periodic marketing audit can benefit companies \nin good health as well as those in trouble.\nBecause the marketing audit resembles the organization of the marketing plan, it follows \nthe G-STIC framework and comprises five key components: goal audit , strategy audit , tactics audit ,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5090, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3c726c7-f7ca-4ea8-aa3d-c7458f9a4980": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3c726c7-f7ca-4ea8-aa3d-c7458f9a4980", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0af6f9ac-4b66-42b5-8834-17f742a2e4c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "271bf7ea58b00cbb9235eba73893f4c8ca380bc37e9d1e6d224ef99b1f7800f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "baee75d4-4641-44b4-a537-c09fb58c647e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap2.pdf"}, "hash": "95fa512255cdb64d3bffde7fbde84ecc1e0ade46ba5b9d54d75f55703cb51afb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a70bb8f9-9872-4079-8b05-f5b398898039", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b303dcd48483dfb5af2a0994699f5ec87ce9ad30cbf319dc68ddbcc919f795e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 2    |  MARKETING  PLANNING  AND \u00a0MANAGEMENT  47\nimplementation audit , and controls audit .

Market-oriented strategic planning is the manage -\nrial process of developing and maintaining a viable \nfit between the organization\u2019s objectives, skills, and \nresources and its changing market opportunities. The \naim of strategic planning is to shape the company\u2019s busi -\nnesses and products so that they yield target profits and \ngrowth. Strategic planning takes place on three levels: \ncorporate, business unit, and market offering.\n2. The corporate strategy establishes the framework \nwithin which the divisions and business units prepare \ntheir strategic plans. Setting a corporate strategy means \ndefining the corporate mission, establishing strategic \nbusiness units (SBUs), assigning resources to each, and \nassessing growth opportunities.\n3. Strategic planning for individual business units includes \ndefining their mission, analyzing external opportunities \nand threats, analyzing internal strengths and weak -\nnesses, and crafting market offerings that will enable the \ncompany to achieve its mission.\n4. Marketing planning and management can occur on two \nlevels. They can focus on analyzing, planning, and man -\naging the company (or a specific business unit within \nthe company), or they can focus on analyzing, planning, \nand managing one or more of the company\u2019s offerings.\n5. From the point of view of designing a particular offer -\ning, marketing planning is a process defined by five \nmain steps: setting a goal , developing the strategy , design -\ning the tactics , defining the implementation  plan, and iden -\ntifying the control  metrics to measure progress toward \nthe set goal. These five steps constitute the G-STIC \nframework, which is the backbone of market planning.\n6.

Google also integrated \ntools into its AdWords platform to help advertisers better \nunderstand the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns. \nWith these tools, advertisers on Google\u2019s platform could \nconstantly monitor and optimize their advertisements. Google \ncalled this approach \u201cmarketing asset management,\u201d imply-\ning that advertisements should be managed like assets in a \nportfolio depending on market conditions. Companies could \nuse the real-time data that Google collected to adjust their \ncampaigns to market conditions, instead of following market-\ning plans developed months in advance.\nGoogle came to dominate search and online advertising \nthanks to its ability to collect and process enormous amounts \nof data from the internet and make them useful. It used this \ncapability to provide consumers and businesses alike with \nthe information they needed. Despite its early successes, \nGoogle never stopped innovating. It continued to expend \nsignificant energy to develop and refine algorithms that could \nbe used to squeeze more information out of the internet and \nkeep Google ahead of the competition. In addition to refining \nexisting products, Google developed a series of free online \nservices for consumers. By applying its computer science \nand design skills to new problems, Google helped users get \nthings done more efficiently and effectively. In many cases, \nrather than coming up with novel products, Google applied \nits expertise to existing categories to create a superior prod-\nuct offering. By entering a slew of new categories, Google \ngave advertisers access to consumers in an increasing num-\nber of contexts. Furthermore, the company gained access to \nincreasing amounts of information on consumers that it could \nfurther monetize in the future.Google\nFrom smart phones to maps to e-mail to search, today \nGoogle is everywhere. This ubiquity makes it easy to forget \nthat the company was founded in 1998 by two Stanford \nUniversity PhD students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They \nnamed the company Google as a play on \u201cgoogol,\u201d the term \nfor the number 1 followed by a hundred zeroes. The name \nexpressed the duo\u2019s ambition to help users sift through the \nnearly limitless amounts of information on the internet. Page \nand Brin further elucidated their goals in Google\u2019s corporate \nmission statement: \u201cTo organize the world\u2019s information \nand make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d To this end, \nthey started by focusing their energy on the nascent field of \ninternet search. The result of their effort was the PageRank \nalgorithm, which counted the number and quality of links to \na given website to rate its relevance and importance. This \nalgorithm proved to be far superior to those used at the time \nby competing search engines such as Yahoo, and Google \nquickly became the dominant company in Web search.\nGoogle\u2019s revenues revolved around advertising early on. \nIt realized that the information from searches on its website \ncould be used to deliver highly targeted advertisements to \nconsumers and took advantage of this opportunity in 2000 by \nlaunching AdWords. This service allowed companies to pay \nGoogle to have their text advertisements show up alongside \nsearch results to queries containing specific words. Hundreds \nof thousands of companies grew to rely on AdWords by buy-\ning these \u201csearch ads.\u201d Google also moved into displaying \nadvertisements beside Web content. In 2003 the company \nlaunched AdSense, which scanned the text on a website  \nand automatically displayed targeted advertisements relevant \nto its contents. W ebsite publishers could earn money every \ntime their visitors clicked on these ads. Prior to this innova-\ntion, most websites were unable to automatically display \nhighly specific ads to match their content.\nGoogle also provided free tools to better serve advertis-\ners and content providers. In 2005, the company launched  \na suite of tools called Google Analytics that allowed con -\ntent providers to see custom reports on the way people  \nbehaved on their websites.

What started as an online \nretailing venture that primarily sold footwear has diversified to \nbecome a leading online vendor of shoes, handbags, cloth-\ning, sunglasses, and accessories.\nThrough continuous internal development and a series of \nacquisitions, Google rapidly expanded its product offerings. \nIn 2004, Google launched Gmail, an advertising-supported \ne-mail service that by 2016 numbered over a billion active \nusers every month. In 2005, the company launched Google \nMaps to compete with existing online mapping services. The \ncompany repeatedly impressed consumers as it upgraded its \nmap service with features such as Street View, which gave \nusers 360-degree views of map locations. In 2006, Google \nbranched into streaming video when it acquired YouTube \nand grew it into a service that generated billions of dollars \nin advertising revenues. That same year the company also \nlaunched Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides\u2014free online alter -\nnatives to elements of the Microsoft Office suite. Google con-\ntinues to expand its online product offerings with everything \nfrom translation tools to calendars to specialized searches.\nAs Google developed into an internet giant, it realized \nthat to continue growing, it would need to expand beyond \nproducts used only on computers. Google identified mobile \ntechnology as one of the ways forward and developed the \nopen source Android mobile operating system. Whereas \ncompanies like Apple created proprietary operating systems \nfor their hardware, Google gave its operating system away \nfree to handset makers. As part of its strategy, Google part-\nnered with companies like Samsung to improve and expand \nAndroid. These partners were free to modify Android and use \nits branding if they stuck to guidelines laid out by Google. In \n2008, one year after Apple introduced the iPhone, Google \nlaunched Android on handsets from a variety of companies. \nToday Android is used on over 80 percent of smart phones \nglobally. All Android users have access to Google Play, the \nofficial app store for the operating system. Google gets a \ncut of all sales. In addition to developing Android, Google \nbecame the leader in the rapidly expanding mobile advertis-\ning space, garnering nearly a third of 2017 U.S. mobile ad \nrevenues in a market worth over $50 billion.\nGoogle has also broadened its reach into other grow-\ning markets like hardware and cloud computing. With cloud \ncomputing, Google is competing with the likes of Amazon \nand Microsoft to provide remote storage capacity, data \nSource: opturadesign/Alamy Stock \nPhoto\nprocessing, and programming tools for enterprises and start-\nups alike. Companies like HSBC have signed on with Google \nas it has rushed to embed itself in this rapidly growing sector. \nGoogle has also introduced a variety of hardware products, \nincluding the 2016 release of its high-end Pixel phones, \ndesigned to compete directly with the iPhone. In the same \nyear it debuted Google Home, a smart speaker that not only \nconnects to smart devices but also responds to voice com-\nmands and interacts with home automation systems.\nGoogle has moved into many categories over its short life -\ntime, but all of its products are drawn together by the company\u2019s \ndesire to harness the power of data to create better customer \nexperiences. In an effort to continue innovating, Google has \ninvested heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence. \nThese rapidly developing technologies offer the company a way \nto automatically sift through ever-increasing amounts of data to \nextract useful information. Google sees the further development \nof AI capabilities as pivotal to its future growth. From transla -\ntion software to Web search to smart-phone cameras, artificial \nintelligence has come to underpin an increasing number of the \ncompany\u2019s product offerings and innovation.\nToday Google has grown into a multinational company \nwith almost $100 billion in revenue, almost 90 percent of \nwhich is from advertising.

CEO Tony Hsieh believed that a strong cus-\ntomer-service experience leads to lasting customer loyalty. In \naddition, instead of viewing the lifetime value of a customer \nas a fixed amount, Zappos\u2019s management believes that the \nvalue of a customer can grow because of excellent customer \nservice.\nZappos places high priority on its customer call team \ncompared to other retailing companies. Specifically,  Zappos \ntakes a uniquely human approach to customer calls and \ne-mails to create a memorable and high-quality customer-\nservice experience. Many online retailers (such as Amazon) \nuse telephone contact as a last resort, with many clicks \nrequired for a customer to find a service number. However, \nZappos invites customers to call by placing a button with its \ntelephone number right at the top of the homepage. Whereas \nsome companies are straying from call-based customer \n service, Zappos believes that the telephone is a valuable \nservice tool with a powerful ability to create more intimate \nhuman contact.\nZappos management believes that the best candidates \nfor its call and e-mail team are permanent employees trained \nin house, rather than lower-cost temporary or outsourced \nworkers. Permanent employees are more likely to adopt the \ncorporate culture and company values. Zappos combined \nits headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada, with its call center \nteam to fully integrate customer service-employees with other \ndepartments, creating a more unified atmosphere.\nZappos identified its biggest problem in creating a \nstrong customer-service experience as finding the best \npotential employees to staff the call center. Zappos\u2019s hiring \nprocess is very selective. Unlike other companies, Zappos \nbases its successful process largely on its perception of \ncandidates\u2019 \u201ccultural fit,\u201d which accounts for 50 percent of \nthe hiring decision. Current employees are encouraged to \nvoice their opinions on whether or not potential hires can fit \nwithin the Zappos family culture and exhibit strong customer-\nservice skills.\nThe company has created its own style and methodol-\nogy for training its call center employees. Once hired, Zappos \nemployees spend their first weeks in the call center learning \nhow to serve the customer\u2019s needs. During this period, a \ntraining team also instills in each employee Zappos\u2019s 10 core \nvalues, which are expected to be seen in the workplace every \nday. Many of these values\u2014which range from \u201cDeliver WOW \nThrough Service\u201d to \u201cBe Adventurous, Creative, and Open-\nMinded\u201d\u2014are what makes the service experience different \nat Zappos. New and old employees take part in a variety of team-building and bonding activities throughout the year. \nThese include activities like scavenger hunts, picnics, and \ntrips to the bowling alley to make all employees feel comfort-\nable with one another. After the call center training and scav-\nenger hunt, new employees are celebrated at a graduation \nceremony, accompanied by the strains of Pomp and Circum-\nstance. If new employees feel they cannot commit fully to the \ncompany culture and values, Zappos offers them $3,000 to \nleave\u2014no questions asked. Zappos is fully committed to hir -\ning only dedicated members as part of its service team.\nZappos\u2019s scrupulous hiring process and its approach \nof teaching the ten core values to new call and email center \nemployees have resulted in a highly rated customer service \nexperience. Zappos\u2019 employees do not work from a script \nand use their own judgment to determine what is needed to \nmake the customer satisfied. Employees are not forced to \nask supervisors for permission about delivering the \u201cWOW\u201d \nfactor and are known to go above and beyond for custom-\ners at their own discretion. In the past, Zappos employees \nhave upgraded shipping speeds for free, sent postcards to \ntravelers, and even gifted flowers and cookies to custom-\ners to provide the \u201cWOW\u201d factor.
