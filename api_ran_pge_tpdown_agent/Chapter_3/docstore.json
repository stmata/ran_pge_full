Adopting a holistic marketing \norientation requires fully understanding customers and gaining a 360-degree view of both their daily \nlives and the changes that occur during their lifetimes to ensure that the right products are marketed \nto the right customers in the right way at the right time.\nThe Model of Consumer Behavior\nResearch on consumer behavior explores how individuals, groups, and organizations select, buy, use, \nand dispose of goods, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy their needs and wants.2 To create cus -\ntomer value, marketers must fully understand both the theory and the reality of consumer behavior.\nThe starting point for understanding consumer behavior is the model shown in Figure 3.1. The \ntactics shaping the offering and the context of the market in which the offering will be sold are filtered \nthrough the cultural, social, and personal lenses of target customers, as well as being influenced by \nconsumer motivation, perception, emotions, and memory. This, in turn, influences the consumer \nbuying process\u2014a journey that entails recognition of a need, a search for the best means to fulfill that \nneed, and evaluation of the available options to finally arrive at the ultimate decision of what, when, \nwhere, and how much to buy, and how to pay for these purchases.3\nWe discuss the key consumer characteristics and the psychological processes underlying con -\nsumer behavior in the following sections.\nConsumer Characteristics\nA consumer\u2019s buying behavior is influenced by cultural, social, and personal factors. Of these, cultural \nfactors exert the broadest and deepest influence on people\u2019s perceptions and desires and on how they \ngo about fulfilling their needs and wants.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:\ncompany; as a sanyasi committed to ascetic life, he is not allowed to profit from business activities. \nOfficially, Ramdev is the \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d who runs Patanjali more like a spiritual organization \nthan a traditional corporation. Neither he nor the company\u2019s official CEO draws a salary, and all \n profits are channeled back into charity, research and development, and cost-efficiency measures \nthat enable Patanjali to undersell its global competitors. Ramdev\u2019s popularity, stemming from his \n television yoga show, greatly contributed to the meteoric rise of the Patanjali brand. In 2014, only \neight years after its launch, the company generated close to $200 million in revenues and had a \nportfolio of 500\u00a0  products. Three years later, its revenue surpassed $1 billion, and the company \naims to reach $15\u00a0billion in annual sales by 2025. Patanjali\u2019s growth comes largely at the expense \nof large  multinationals such as Nestl\u00e9, Colgate, Unilever, and Mondel\u0113z, which are often unable to \nmatch Patanjali\u2019s low prices and the power of Baba Ramdev\u2019s brand.1", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3264, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d2da004-4231-4668-a0b0-cd989df9dbcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d2da004-4231-4668-a0b0-cd989df9dbcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58abce4c-a82a-4cf2-a69b-6697d908231a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "407f48b60442fd438e896aa652a316ca13dc201b699b7a4cb3fe1bcd97557c62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6a57c72-20fa-428e-be90-86f71f916a82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "ea1ecf24e7f89d084ab2eb4da0d51a1341aaf31c1489233fde89ab2d34e3d7a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3259a63f-eb66-4d18-bcfb-566b7e35bb43", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89b1c39c8faea4d0f8927e3eccbac5ceaa06b9c9127e8bfd50c92dbeffc75651", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "54 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nCULTURAL FACTORS\nA culture is a way of life among a group of people\u2014the behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols that \nthey accept, generally without thinking about them, and that are passed along by communication and \nimitation from one generation to the next.4\nCulture, subculture, and social class are particularly important influences on consumer buying \nbehavior. Culture is a fundamental determinant of a person\u2019s wants and behavior. Through family and \nother key institutions, a child growing up in the United States is exposed to values such as achievement \nand success, activity, efficiency and practicality, progress, material comfort, individualism, freedom, \nhumanitarianism, and youthfulness.5 A child growing up in another country might have a different \nview of self, relationship to others, and rituals.\nCultures can differ on a variety of dimensions, such as the extent to which people prioritize \nclose (vs. distant) others and whether they behave as if they are part of a collective (i.e., collectivistic \ncultures) or see themselves as independent agents who value their autonomy (i.e., individualistic \ncultures). Marketers must closely attend to cultural values in every country to understand how best \nto market their existing products and find opportunities to develop new products. Each culture also \nconsists of subcultures that provide members with more specific identification and socialization. \nSubcultures include nationalities, religions, racial groups, and geographic regions. When subcul -\ntures grow sufficiently large and affluent, companies often design specialized marketing programs \nto serve them.\nTo determine the effect of culture on purchases, a recent longitudinal study examined data \nfrom 30,000 customers of a global fashion retailer in 30 countries. The study analyzed demographic \nbackground, shopping behavior, participation in loyalty programs, types of products bought, prod -\nuct returns, and advertising costs\u2014including e-mail and catalogs\u2014using a framework that enabled \nnational culture to be examined according to the importance of individualism and collectivism, level \nof indulgence or restraint, type of offerings bought, loyalty to companies/brands, tendency to embrace \nnew technologies, and use of media. Among the findings: Consumers in individualistic societies like \nAustralia and the United States are more likely to buy for themselves, follow trends, use multiple pur -\nchase channels (including online and catalog) to find the best deal, and return items that fall below \nexpectations, whereas consumers in collectivist countries (e.g., Portugal, Mexico, and Turkey) tend to \nfollow the crowd, value long-term reputation, shop for their families, buy from trusted retailers, and \nprefer traditional brick-and mortar stores.6\nVirtually all human societies exhibit social stratification,  most often in the form of social classes\u2014\nrelatively homogeneous, enduring, and hierarchically ordered divisions in a society whose members \nshare similar values, interests, and behavior. For example, the United States has lower, middle, and \nupper classes. Social class members show distinct product and brand preferences in many areas.

For example, places like India and Brazil \nhave relatively rigid social hierarchies, with people\u2019s positions on the various rungs being deter -\nmined at birth.\nPervasive inequality still exists among the upper, middle, and lower classes in Brazil, which are \noften divided into A-B-C-D-E socioeconomic segments by statisticians and marketers. Although it is \nrelaxing slightly, this strict social stratification still divides wealthier and better-educated property \nowners, and those with special technical skills and expertise (A and B classes), from the large and \n disproportionately poor E-class segment of the population that has limited access to employment, \neducation, and even basic government services like health and sanitation. C-class individuals  typically \nhave at least a high school degree and provide services to those in the A & B classes as teachers, \n managers, nurses, and the like. Individuals in the D class serve the C class as maids, drivers,  bartenders, \n mechanics, etc. Those in the lowest economic stratum typically have not completed elementary \nschool, are often illiterate, and, when employed, are usually found in jobs such as cleaner and street \nsweeper that pay meager wages.8\nSOCIAL FACTORS\nIn addition to cultural factors, social factors such as reference groups, including family, affect our \nbuying behavior. We address these factors in more detail next.\nReference Groups.  Reference groups  include all the groups that have a direct or indirect effect \non a person\u2019s beliefs, decisions, and behavior. Family members typically constitute the most influential \nprimary reference group. Parents and siblings have a major influence in forming an individual\u2019s beliefs, \nvalue system, and behavior. An individual\u2019s spouse and children, on the other hand, have a more direct \nimpact on everyday buying decisions, especially in the case of high-ticket items and items that are used \nby different members of the household.\nReference groups include not only those that individuals belong to, such as friends, neighbors, \ncoworkers, and religious and interest-based groups. Individuals may also be influenced by groups to \nwhich they do not belong, such as aspirational groups that they hope to join and dissociative groups \nwhose values or behavior they reject.\nWhere reference group influence is strong, marketers must determine how to reach and influence \nthe group\u2019s opinion leaders. An opinion leader , or an influencer , is a person who offers informal \nadvice or information about a specific product or product category, such as which of several brands \nis best or how a particular product may be used.9 Opinion leaders are often highly confident, socially \nactive, and frequent users of the product category. Marketers try to reach these leaders by identifying \ntheir demographic and psychographic characteristics and the media they read, as well as by directing \nmessages to them.10\nAll of us participate in many groups\u2014family, clubs, organizations\u2014that often influence our \nnorms of behavior. We can define a person\u2019s position in each group in terms of role and status. A role \nconsists of the activities a person is expected to perform. Each role in turn connotes a status . A senior \nvice president of marketing may have more status than a sales manager, and a sales manager may have \nmore status than an office clerk. People choose products that reflect and communicate their role and \ntheir actual or desired status in society. Thus, marketers must be aware of the status-symbol and self-\ndefining potential of products and brands.\nFamily.  The family, as the most influential primary reference group,11 is the most important con -\nsumer buying organization in society. There are two families in the buyer\u2019s life. The family of orientation  \nconsists of parents and siblings. From parents a person acquires an orientation toward religion, politics, \nand economics, along with a sense of personal ambition, self-worth, and love.12 Even if the buyer no \nlonger interacts very much with his or her parents, parental influence on behavior can be a significant \ndeterminant of purchases.\nA more direct influence on everyday buying behavior is the family of procreation \u2014namely, the per -\nson\u2019s spouse and children. In the United States, purchases have in the past varied widely by product cat -\negory, with the wife usually acting as the family\u2019s main purchasing agent, especially for food, sundries,", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4752, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "045a121d-27cb-48b9-bfc1-fab34c581e2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "045a121d-27cb-48b9-bfc1-fab34c581e2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5c78870-6b73-4348-849e-1f7938670251", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "20e0b821fb936724a9cd471aa246b2406436808194e20990ff659117b1cb8143", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3259a63f-eb66-4d18-bcfb-566b7e35bb43", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "d3de8abe93decb591838aeb1db89c92830afb13c4fd7ec4909556d7f435c95af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a8c4ebf-7efe-4b4a-b09f-669312147364", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "406f1cdf80664a793ac7bca83feacb743bd2bbf019a92f62b124814acb7efce9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "56 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nand clothing items. Traditional purchasing roles are now changing, and marketers now see both men \nand women as viable targets.\nFor expensive products and services such as cars, vacations, or housing, the vast majority of \nspouses engage in joint decision making.13 Men and women may respond differently to marketing \nmessages, however. Research has shown that women tend to place greater value connections and \nrelationships with family and friends and place a higher priority on people than on companies.14 \nAccordingly, marketers have customized the positioning of many products such as Quaker\u2019s Nutrition \nfor Women cereals and Crest rejuvenating and whitening toothpaste.\nAnother shift in buying patterns is an increase in the amount of dollars spent by children and \nteens and the direct and indirect purchasing influence they wield. Direct influence takes the form of \nchildren\u2019s hints, requests, and demands: \u201cI want to go to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d Indirect influence means that \nparents know the brands, product choices, and preferences of their children without hints or outright \nrequests: \u201cI think Jake and Emma would prefer to go to Panera.\u201d\nA recent survey of the social media habits of 13- to 33-year-olds reveals that only 2 percent say \nthey do not use any social platform, and Millennials report that they use their smartphones more \nthan 11\u00a0hours each day, mostly for messaging and social networking. The majority of participants \nsay\u00a0they have friended or followed a brand on social media; 38 percent have posted about a brand, with \n54\u00a0 percent of these posts being positive and only 22 percent negative.15\nPERSONAL FACTORS\nPersonal characteristics that influence buyers\u2019 decisions include their age and stage in the life cycle, \noccupation and economic circumstances, personality and self-concept, and lifestyle and values. \nBecause many of these factors have a direct impact on consumer behavior, it is important for mar -\nketers to follow them closely.\nOur taste in food, clothes, furniture, and recreation is often related to our age. Consumption is \nalso shaped by the family life cycle  and the number, age, and gender of people in the household at any \ngiven time. U.S. households are evolving: The traditional family of four with a husband, wife, and two \nkids makes up a much smaller percentage of total households than it once did.\nIn addition, psychological  life-cycle stages may matter. Adults experience certain passages, or \ntransformations, as they go through life,16 causing their behavior during these intervals to adapt to \nchanging circumstances. Marketers should consider critical life events or transitions \u2014marriage, child -\nbirth, illness, relocation, divorce, first job, career change, retirement, death of a spouse\u2014as giving \nrise to new needs. Companies should be alert to these needs and provide products and services that \ncan best meet them.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the baby industry attracts many marketers, given the enormous amount \nparents spend and the life-changing nature of parenthood.\nThe Baby Market  Although they may not yet have reached their full earning potential, \nexpectant and new parents seldom hold back when spending on their loved ones, making the \nbaby industry more recession-proof than most. Spending tends to peak between the second \ntrimester of pregnancy and the twelfth week after birth. First-time mothers-to-be are especially \nattractive target customers since they will be unable to use many hand-me-downs and will \nneed to acquire a full range of new furniture, strollers, toys, and baby supplies. Recognizing the \nimportance of reaching expectant parents early to win their trust\u2014industry pundits call it a \u201cfirst \nin, first win\u201d opportunity\u2014marketers use a variety of media, including direct mail, inserts, space \nads, e-mail marketing, and websites. Product samples are especially popular, and kits are often \ndistributed at childbirth education classes and other places. Many hospitals have banned the \ntraditional bedside gift bag, however, because of concerns with privacy and potentially adverse \neffects on a vulnerable audience (e.g., distributing baby formula may discourage new mothers \nfrom breastfeeding). other avenues of access exist: For example, Disney Baby partners with a \ncompany that sells baby bedside photos, hands out playful Disney Cuddly Bodysuits, and solicits \nsign-ups for e-mail alerts from DisneyBaby.com. Not all expenditures go directly to baby-related \npurchases. Such a fundamental life change gives expectant or new parents a whole new set of \nneeds that has them thinking differently about life insurance, financial services, real estate, home \nimprovement, and automobiles.17", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4729, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a8c4ebf-7efe-4b4a-b09f-669312147364": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a8c4ebf-7efe-4b4a-b09f-669312147364", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e975789a-6b84-439d-b3e8-f561cdd5ca17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "11abd6fc0b10c8f4180a043d9d9c941994dca3f73b1329ff12fd7a08858c193a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "045a121d-27cb-48b9-bfc1-fab34c581e2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "20e0b821fb936724a9cd471aa246b2406436808194e20990ff659117b1cb8143", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "429dfee4-08e5-4ae4-ac08-438c8152bac8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c7dc34b2f203eb48228ad9e52cf989e3b2c8871859fb2ce80de8765efbab63b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 3    |  ANAlyzING CoNSUMER  MARKETS  57\nOccupation also influences consumption patterns.  Marketers try \nto identify the occupational groups that have above-average interest in \ntheir products and services, and they even tailor products for  certain \noccupational groups. Computer software companies, for example, \ndesign different products for brand managers, engineers, lawyers, \nand physicians. Michigan-based Carhartt Inc., founded in 1889, has \nbecome a global work-clothing dynasty with 800 products, a net -\nwork of some 100 metro-Detroit retail stores, and  corporate stores \nin seven states, as well as Carhartt Europe and Australia. Carhartt\u2019s \nline of durable industrial, farm, and outdoor clothing is known for \nquality fabrics and workmanship and through the years has gained \ntraction as streetwear.18\nBoth product choice and brand choice are greatly affected \nby economic circumstances like the level, stability, and pattern of \nspendable income; savings and assets, including the percentage that \nis liquid; debts and borrowing power; and attitudes toward spend -\ning and saving. If economic indicators point to a recession, market -\ners can take steps to redesign, reposition, and reprice their products \nor emphasize discount brands so they can continue to offer value to \ntarget customers.\nPersonality and Self-Concept.  By personality  we mean a \nset of distinguishing human psychological traits that lead to relatively \nconsistent and enduring responses to environmental stimuli, includ -\ning buying behavior. We often describe personality in terms of such \ntraits as self-confidence, dominance, autonomy, deference,  sociability, \ndefensiveness, and adaptability.19\nConsumers typically choose and use brands with a brand per -\nsonality consistent with their actual self-concept  (how we view our -\nselves), although the match may instead be based on the consumer\u2019s \nideal self-concept  (how we would like to view ourselves) or even on oth-\ners\u2019 self-concept  of us (how we think others see us).20 These effects may be more pronounced for publicly \nconsumed products than for privately consumed goods.21 On the other hand, consumers who are high \n\u201cself-monitors\u201d\u2014that is, are sensitive to the way others see them\u2014are more likely to choose brands whose \npersonalities fit the consumption situation.22\nFinally, multiple aspects of self (serious, professional, caring family member, active fun-lover) may \noften be evoked differently in different situations or around different types of people.

Marketers who target consumers on the \nbasis of their values believe that appealing to people\u2019s inner selves \nmakes it possible to influence their outer selves\u2014their purchase \nbehavior.\nPeople from the same subculture, social class, and occupa -\ntion may adopt quite different lifestyles. A lifestyle  is a person\u2019s pat -\ntern of living in the world, as expressed in activities, interests, and \nopinions. It portrays the \u201cwhole person\u201d interacting with his or \nher environment.24\nLifestyles are shaped partly by whether consumers are money-\nconstrained  or time-constrained.  Companies that aim to serve the \nmoney-constrained will create lower-cost products and services. \nBy appealing to thrifty consumers, Walmart has become the larg -\nest company in the world. Its \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d have wrung \ntens of billions of dollars out of the retail supply chain, passing \nthe larger part of savings along to shoppers in the form of rock-\nbottom bargain prices.\nConsumers are prone to multitasking. Some will also pay oth -\ners to perform tasks because time is more important to them than \nmoney. Companies aiming to serve them will create products and services that offer multiple time-\nsaving benefits. For example, multitasking beauty balm (BB) skin creams offer an all-in-one approach \nto skin care, incorporating a moisturizer, anti-aging ingredients, sunscreen, and sometimes even a \nwhitening agent.25\nIn some categories, notably food processing, companies targeting time-constrained consumers \nneed to be aware that these very same people want to believe they\u2019re not operating within time con -\nstraints. Marketers call those seeking both convenience and some involvement in the cooking process the \n\u201cconvenience involvement segment,\u201d as Hamburger Helper (rebranded as \u201cHelper\u201d in 2013) discovered.\nHamburger Helper  launched in 1971 in response to tough economic times, the \ninexpensive pasta-and-powdered-seasoning mix was designed to quickly and inexpensively \nstretch a pound of meat into a family meal. With an estimated 44 percent of evening meals \nprepared in under 30 minutes, and given the strong competition from fast-food drive-through \nwindows, restaurant deliveries, and precooked grocery store dishes, it might have seemed that \nHamburger Helper\u2019s days of prosperity were numbered. Market researchers found, however, that \nsome consumers don\u2019t want the fastest microwaveable solution possible. They also want to feel \ngood about how they prepare a meal. In fact, on average, they prefer to use at least one pot or \npan and spend 15 minutes on food preparation. To remain attractive to this segment, marketers \nof Helper introduced new flavors and varieties, such as Tuna Helper, Asian Chicken Helper, and \nWhole Grain Helper, to tap into evolving consumer taste trends. The result: The brand sales \nsteadily rose.26>> Market research \nspurred Hamburger \nHelper to introduce new \nflavors and varieties \nthat reflected consumer \ntastes and ramped-up \nsales.\nSource: Keith Homan/Alamy Stock Photo\nConsumer Psychology\nWhen marketing and environmental stimuli enter the consumer\u2019s consciousness, a set of psychologi -\ncal processes combine with certain consumer characteristics to result in decision processes and pur -\nchase decisions.

Needs  are the basic human requirements, such as air, food, water, clothing, and \nshelter. Some needs are biological  and arise from physiological states of tension such as hunger, thirst, \nor discomfort. Other needs are psychological  and arise from psychological states of tension such as the \nneed for recognition, esteem, or belonging.\nOne of the best-known theories of human motivation, that of Abraham Maslow, carries impor -\ntant implications for consumer analysis and marketing strategy. Maslow sought to explain why people \nare driven by particular needs at particular times.27 His answer is that human needs are arranged in a \nhierarchy from most to least pressing\u2014from physiological needs to safety needs, social needs, esteem \nneeds, and self-actualization needs (see Figure 3.2). People try to satisfy their most important needs \nfirst and then move to the next important. For example, a starving man will not take an interest in the \nlatest happenings in the art world (need 5), or in the way he is viewed by others (need 3 or 4), or even \nin whether he is breathing clean air (need 2) until he has enough food and water (need 1), after which \nthe next most important needs will become salient.\nNeeds become wants  when directed to specific objects that might satisfy the need. Our wants are \nshaped by our society. A U.S. consumer needs food but may want a Chicago-style \u201cdeep-dish\u201d pizza \nand a craft beer. A consumer in India needs food but may want chole, tandoori chicken, and naan.\nDemands  are wants for specific products backed by an ability to pay. Many people want a Mercedes \nbut only relatively few can buy one. Companies must measure not only how many people want their \nproduct but also how many are willing and able to buy it. These distinctions shed light on the criticism \nthat \u201cmarketers get people to buy things they don\u2019t want.\u201d Marketers do not create needs: Needs pre-\nexist marketers. Marketers might promote the idea that a Mercedes satisfies a person\u2019s need for social \nstatus. They do not, however, create the need for social status.\nSome customers have needs that they are not fully conscious of or cannot articulate. What does \nthe customer mean when asking for a \u201cpowerful\u201d lawn mower or a \u201cpeaceful\u201d hotel? The marketer \nmust probe further. Responding only to the stated need may shortchange the customer.28 Consumers \ndid not know much about tablet computers when they were first introduced, but Apple worked dili -\ngently to shape consumer perceptions and adoption of this technological innovation. To gain an edge, \ncompanies must help customers learn what they want\u2014and make it convenient for them to obtain it. \nDollar Shave Club\u2019s subscription service helped customers realize they could pay less for razors and \nBlue Apron helped people overcome a lack of confidence in their culinary skills that made cooking at \nhome appear difficult.\nConsumer Motivation.  We all have many needs at any given time. A need becomes a motiva -\ntion when aroused to a sufficient level of intensity to drive us to act.29 Motivation has both direction \n(we select one goal over another) and intensity (we pursue the chosen goal with more or less vigor).\nFIGURE 3.2 \nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nSource: A.

Based in part on his research, the Dreamliner has a spa -\ncious foyer; larger, curved luggage bins closer to the ceiling; larger, electronically dimmed windows; \nand a ceiling discreetly lit by hidden LEDs.31 The opposite occurred with Chrysler\u2019s PT Cruiser, which \nreached the end of the road in less than a decade.\nPT Cruiser  When introduced at the beginning of the 21st century, the PT (Personal \nTransportation) Cruiser\u2019s retro looks and accessible price proved to be a hit with consumers \nin all age groups, although the polarizing design (\u201ca cross between an old-time milk truck and \nluxurious sedans of the 1930s\u201d) had its critics as well as its imitators, like the Chevrolet HHR. The \nPT Cruiser was the first DaimlerChrysler vehicle designed using archetype research, a qualitative \nmethod developed by French medical anthropologist Clotaire Rapaille. Rapaille\u2019s approach \nfocused on uncovering the deep-seated psychological drivers of consumers\u2019 behavior that go \nbeyond such specific product attributes as color, size, and convenience to capture the feelings \nand emotions that define the \u201ccultural unconscious\u201d (or, in the words of Rapaille, consumers\u2019 \n\u201creptilian hot button\u201d) that defines product choice. The result was a five-door, tall-roofed \nhatchback that was intended to evoke a nostalgic emotional reaction. Upon its launch, the PT \nCruiser was considered a massive success, selling 145,000 vehicles in 2001. But by 2009, sales \nhad plummeted to 18,000. The reason for the PT\u2019s decline came down to Chrysler\u2019s failure to \ninvest in improving and updating the car, as well as its failure to release new models in response \nto consumer demand. In addition, the design appealed to a distinctly American audience during \na time when globalization was becoming increasingly important to recouping research and \ndevelopment costs.32research. For example, when sales of its instant Betty Crocker cake mix began to plateau in \nthe 1950s, General Mills looked to Viennese-American psychologist and behavioral marketer \nErnest Dichter. The dry cake mix required only the addition of water. Using Freudian methods to \nquery focus groups of women, Dichter concluded that the ritual of baking a cake was rife with \nrelationship and fertility symbolism and suggested removing the powdered egg from the mix, \ninstead making housewives add their own fresh eggs. Sales soared after General Mills followed \nthis advice.30\n<< The PT Cruiser was \nDaimlerChrysler\u2019s first \nforay into vehicle design \nusing archetype research \nintended to trigger an \nemotional appeal and \nlead to purchase. \nSource: imageBR oKER/Alamy Stock Photo", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3019, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "134b7f1b-4a72-409c-b110-0887f1fa5ca3": {"__data__": {"id_": "134b7f1b-4a72-409c-b110-0887f1fa5ca3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff663714-1a99-4eaa-97a0-a3cc25b8818b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "e3c8795f9896c0e71c088b0024eac23a2e3b91cec6105c9ef7310be13135ad28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14fec5cb-7f0b-47a3-8595-f465b2ae3a32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "e70653c6fb858a0acdabc64f74a5a10d95317217077e91396e7b6f49bd2a3eea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91d76326-f601-4390-a218-be49127fec9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf4ffcd3ec2f25d6ec7ec7669f234acd65191ec62da859e28486def99c44d7d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "62 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nPERCEPTION\nPerception  is the process by which we select, organize, and interpret information inputs to create \na meaningful picture of the world.33 A motivated person is ready to act. How  this person will act is \ninfluenced by his or her perception of the situation. In marketing, perceptions are more important \nthan reality because they affect consumers\u2019 actual behavior.\nPerception depends not only on physical stimuli but also on the stimuli\u2019s relationship to the sur -\nrounding environment and on conditions that exist within each of us. One person might perceive a \nfast-talking salesperson as aggressive and insincere, whereas another might regard the salesperson as \nintelligent and helpful. Each will respond to the salesperson differently. People emerge with different \nperceptions of the same object because of three perceptual processes: selective attention, selective \ndistortion, and selective retention.\nSelective Attention.  Attention is the allocation of processing capacity to some stimulus. Vol -\nuntary attention is something we do purposefully; involuntary attention occurs when our attention is \ngrabbed by someone or something. It\u2019s estimated that the average person may be exposed to thousands \nof ads or brand communications every day. Because we cannot possibly attend to all these, we screen \nout most stimuli, a process called selective attention. Selective attention  means that marketers must \nwork hard to attract the notice of consumers. The real challenge is to determine which stimuli people \nwill notice. Here are some findings:\n\u2022 People are more likely to notice stimuli that relate to a current need.  A person who is motivated to buy a \nsmartphone will notice smartphone ads and be less likely to notice non-phone-related ads.\n\u2022 People are more likely to notice stimuli they anticipate.  You are more likely to notice laptops than  portable \nradios in a computer store because you don\u2019t expect the store to carry portable radios.\n\u2022 People are more likely to notice stimuli whose deviations are large in relationship to the normal size of the \n stimuli.  You are more likely to notice an ad offering $100 off the list price of a computer than one \noffering $5 off.\nAlthough we screen out much information, we are influenced by unexpected stimuli, such as \nunanticipated offers in the mail, over the internet, or from a salesperson. Marketers may attempt to \npromote their offers intrusively in order to bypass selective attention filters.\nSelective attention mechanisms require active engagement and thought on the part of the con -\nsumer. Subliminal perception  has long fascinated armchair marketers, who argue that marketers \nembed covert, subliminal messages in ads or packaging that consumers are not consciously aware \nof but that affect their behavior. Although it\u2019s clear that mental processes include many subtle \nsubconscious effects,34 no evidence supports the notion that marketers can systematically control \nconsumers at that level, especially enough to change strongly held or even moderately important \nbeliefs.35\nSelective Distortion.  Ever noticed that stimuli don\u2019t always come across in the way the senders \nintended? Selective distortion  is the tendency to interpret information to fit our preconceptions. \nConsumers will often distort information to make it consistent with prior brand and product beliefs \nand expectations. For a stark demonstration of the power of consumer brand beliefs, consider taste \ntests in which one group of consumers samples a product without knowing the brand, while another \ngroup is aware of the brand during sampling. Invariably, the groups will have different opinions despite \nconsuming exactly the same product .\nWhen consumers report different opinions of branded and unbranded versions of identical prod -\nucts, it must be that their brand and product beliefs, created by whatever means (e.g., past experiences, \nbrand promotions, familial preferences), have somehow changed their product perceptions. We can \nfind examples of this for virtually every type of product. When Coors changed its label from \u201c  Banquet \nBeer\u201d to \u201cOriginal Draft,\u201d consumers claimed the taste had changed even though the formulation \nremained the same.\nIn another study, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brochet, at the University of Bordeaux, gave glasses of red and white \nwine to wine science students and asked for descriptions.

In other words, coffee may \nseem to taste better, a car may seem to drive more smoothly, and the wait in a bank line may seem \nshorter, depending on the brand.\nEMOTIONS\nEmotions are mental states that arise spontaneously rather than from conscious effort and reflect \npeople\u2019s positive or negative reactions to internal and external stimuli. We typically have little control \nof feelings such as joy, sorrow, anger, fear, and ambivalence, which vary in intensity and complex -\nity depending on our personal reactions and can be accompanied by physiological and behavioral \nchanges.\nConsumer response is not all cognitive and rational. Many responses may be emotional and evoke \ndifferent kinds of feelings. A brand or product may make a consumer feel proud, excited, or confident. \nAn ad may create feelings of amusement, disgust, or wonder. Brands like Hallmark, McDonald\u2019s, and \nCoca-Cola have made an emotional connection with loyal customers for years. Marketers increasingly \nrecognize the power of emotional appeals, especially if they are rooted in some functional or rational \naspects of the brand.\nTo help teen girls and young women feel more comfortable talking about feminine-hygiene and \nfeminine-care products, Kimberly-Clark used four different social media networks in its \u201cBreak the \nCycle\u201d campaign for its U by Kotex brand. With overwhelmingly positive feedback, the campaign \nhelped Kotex move into the top spot in terms of word-of-mouth share for that feminine-care target \nmarket.37\nAn emotion-filled brand story has been shown to trigger\u2019s people desire to pass along things they \nhear about brands through either word of mouth or online sharing. Firms are giving their communica -\ntions a stronger human appeal to engage consumers in their brand stories.38 Ray-Ban\u2019s 75th anniversary \ncampaign, \u201cNever Hide,\u201d showed a variety of stand-out and stylish hipsters to suggest that wearers \nof the brand\u2019s aviator glasses and sunglasses feel attractive and cool. Some brands have tapped into \nthe hip-hop culture and music to market a brand in a modern multicultural way, as Apple did with \nits\u00a0iPod.39\nMany marketers like Ray-Ban have leveraged the emotional appeal of the past to connect with \ncurrent customers, particularly younger ones. Although e-mail, Webinars, and social media plat -\nforms have seriously displaced direct mail, seminars, and trade shows, the latter can still play an \neffective role in marketing efforts. Retro marketing tactics and products have shown that nostalgia \ncan pay, as costumed mascots, spinning signs, community gatherings, and billboards continue to \ncapture the attention of customers. Products like the revived Beetle, the Fiat 500, and Cadbury\u2019s \nresurrected Wispa chocolate bar show that products steeped in the aura of days gone by enjoy \na visceral connection with customers. Fashion houses base new designs on those of past eras. \nMillerCoors announced a retro marketing campaign for Miller Lite beer, along with a version of \nthe original Miller Lite label from the 1970s. Cartier, Motel 6, and Life Savers are among other \nmajor brands that have gone retro with ad campaigns. Even football players cash in on nostalgia \nmarketing: The NFL Pittsburgh Steelers have worn jerseys that are a throwback to the team\u2019s 1932 \nuniforms.40\nJust as products and brands can elicit certain emotions, different emotional states can influence \npeople\u2019s judgments and decisions. For example, emotions such as fear can increase or decrease the \neffectiveness of different marketing strategies that include social proof (e.g., communicating a product\u2019s \npopularity) and scarcity (e.g., \u201climited edition\u201d).41 Similarly, seeing the emotions of others can also \nbe used as a marketing tool. For example, displaying sad (vs. neutral or happy) faces of victims could \nincrease the likelihood that people will donate to a charity.42\nMEMORY\nMemory\u2014the brain\u2019s ability to record, store, and retrieve information and events\u2014also plays a role \nin consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions.

Cognitive psychologists distinguish between short-term memory \u2014a tem -\nporary and limited repository of information\u2014and long-term memory \u2014a more permanent, poten -\ntially unlimited repository. All the information and experiences we encode as we go through life can \nend up in our long-term memory.\nResearchers distinguish three types of long-term memory: episodic, semantic, and procedural.\n\u2022 Episodic memory  is responsible for storing information about events (i.e., episodes) that we have \nexperienced in our lives. It is an individual\u2019s memory of autobiographical events that capture the \ncontext\u2014such as times, places, and associated emotions\u2014in which a particular event has occurred.\n\u2022 Semantic memory  is responsible for storing information about the world, such as facts, meanings, \nand concepts. Unlike episodic memory, which is directly linked to an individual\u2019s personal experi -\nence, semantic memory captures general knowledge that is independent of personal experience.\n\u2022 Procedural memory  is responsible for knowing how to perform certain procedures such as walking, \ntalking, and riding a bike. It is a memory of motor skills typically acquired through repetition and \ninvolves automatic sensorimotor activities that are so deeply embedded in our minds that they do \nnot involve conscious thought.\nMost widely accepted views of the structure of long-term memory assume we form some kind of \nassociative model. For example, the associative network memory model  views long-term memory as a set \nof nodes and links. Nodes  are stored information connected by links  that vary in strength. Any type of \ninformation can be stored in the memory network, including verbal, visual, abstract, and contextual \ninformation.\nAn activation process that spreads from node to node determines how much information we \nretrieve and can recall in any given situation. When a node becomes activated because we\u2019re encoding \nexternal information (when we read or hear a word or phrase) or retrieving internal information from \nlong-term memory (when we think about some concept), other nodes are also activated if they\u2019re \nassociated strongly enough with the initially activated node.\nBased on the associative network memory model, we can think of consumer brand knowledge \nas a node in memory with a variety of linked associations. The strength and organization of these \nassociations are important determinants of the information we can recall about the brand. Brand \n associations  consist of all brand-related thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, \nand attitudes that become linked to the brand node. For example, the Adidas brand can conjure \nthoughts of soccer, shoes, running, tennis, sports apparel, health, fitness, active lifestyle, and outdoor \nadventures. It also might evoke associations with competitive brands such as Nike, Puma, and Reebok; \nbrand ambassadors such as Lionel Messi and Kylie Jenner; and country of origin\u2014Germany.\nIn this context, we can think of marketing as a way of making sure consumers have product and \nservice experiences that create the right brand knowledge structures and maintain them in memory. \nCompanies such as Procter & Gamble like to create maps that depict the key associations likely to be \ntriggered in consumers\u2019 minds by a particular brand in a marketing setting and their relative strength, \nfavorability, and uniqueness.\nMemory Processes.  Memory is very much a process of construction, because people don\u2019t \nremember information completely and accurately. Often, we remember just bits and pieces and fill in \nthe rest based on whatever else we know. In general, memory can be described as a process of encod -\ning and retrieval.\nMemory encoding  describes how and where information gets into memory. The strength of the \nresulting association depends on the degree to which we process the information we\u2019re encoding (e.g., \nhow much we think about it) and in what way.43 In general, the more attention we pay to the meaning \nof information during encoding, the stronger the resulting memory associations. And the more we are \nable to associate new information with other information already encoded in our memory, the better \nwe will be able to remember it.\nMemory retrieval  is the way we reclaim information from memory. Three facts are important \nabout memory retrieval.\n\u2022 Cognitive psychologists believe that once information is encoded and stored in long-term memory \nit is extremely durable and its strength of association decays very slowly.\n\u2022 Information may be available  in memory but not be accessible  for recall without the proper retrieval \ncues or reminders. The effectiveness of retrieval cues is one reason why marketing inside  a super -\nmarket or retail store is so critical: The product packaging and use of in-store mini-billboard", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4887, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81d38a0c-b9d0-4edb-bac2-3dd0c24eb70a": {"__data__": {"id_": "81d38a0c-b9d0-4edb-bac2-3dd0c24eb70a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29baa730-5eb9-476d-87f9-d28081cd49d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "9979c2a2afceb051f48f61b73e9f83704551d30832d7425831125d95179c57b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5db915e8-aa2e-4667-bf18-b19e26594b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "eedd1d97ff979e31dced9b0c4bf4fb5bf5d06fb14af7346ac2803a9682645127", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e757fbc-6ece-40d4-8add-03cd5b147421", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9479500822002b4db3a97e864eada2c546f341c1098683fcde476d904b1075a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 3    |  ANAlyzING CoNSUMER  MARKETS  65\ndisplays remind us of information already conveyed outside the store and become prime determi -\nnants of consumer decision making. Accessibility of a brand in memory is important for another \nreason: People talk about a brand when it is top of mind.44\n\u2022 Information about other offerings can produce interference effects and cause us to either overlook \nor confuse new data. One marketing challenge in a category crowded with many competitors\u2014\ne.g., airlines, financial services, and insurance companies\u2014is that consumers may mix up brands.\nBecause of selective retention , we\u2019re likely to remember only the positive aspects of a product we like, \nforgetting its negative aspects and the good points about competing products.\nThe Buying Decision Process\nThe basic psychological processes we\u2019ve reviewed play an important role in consumers\u2019 actual buy -\ning decisions. Here are some key consumer-behavior questions that marketers should ask in terms of \nwho, what, when, where, how, and why:\nWho buys our product or service? Who makes the decision to buy the product or service?\nWho influences the decision to buy the product or service? How is the purchase decision made? Who \nassumes what role in the decision process?\nWhat does the customer buy? What needs must be satisfied? What wants are fulfilled?\nWhy do customers buy a particular brand? What benefits do they seek?\nWhere do customers go or look to buy the product or service? Online and/or offline? When do they \nbuy? Any seasonality factors? Any time of day/week/month?\nHow is our product or service perceived by customers? What are customers\u2019 attitudes toward our \nproduct or service?\nWhat social factors might influence the purchase decision? Do customers\u2019 lifestyles influence their \ndecisions? How do personal, demographic, or economic factors influence the purchase decision?   45\nSmart companies try to fully understand a customer\u2019s buying decision process, which involves \nall the experiences in learning, choosing, using, and even disposing of a product. Marketing scholars \nhave developed a \u201cstage model\u201d of this decision process (see Figure 3.3), in which the consumer typi -\ncally passes through five stages: problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, \npurchase decision, and postpurchase behavior.46\nThe process by which consumers make purchase decisions and their postpurchase behavior are \noften referred to as the consumer decision journey .47 The reference to a journey stems from the fact that \nthe manner in which consumers make purchase decisions is not always linear, as depicted in Figure \n3.3. Instead, it is often an iterative process in which consumers are influenced by the new information \nthey encounter at the different stages of their decision, which can involve the need to go back and revisit \ntheir earlier judgments. Recognizing this, marketers must develop activities and programs that reach \nconsumers through different touchpoints at all stages of the decision process.\nConsumers don\u2019t always pass through all five stages; they may skip or reverse some. When you buy \nyour regular brand of toothpaste, you go directly from the problem-recognition stage to the purchase \ndecision, skipping information search and evaluation. The model in Figure 3.3 provides a good frame \nof reference, however, because it captures the full range of considerations that arise when a consumer \ncontemplates a new purchase or a high-involvement product that entails functional, psychological, or \nmonetary risk. Later in the chapter, we will consider other ways in which consumers make decisions \nthat are less calculated.\nPROBLEM RECOGNITION\nThe buying process starts when the buyer recognizes a problem or need triggered by internal or exter -\nnal stimuli. With an internal stimulus, one of the person\u2019s basic needs\u2014hunger, thirst, sex\u2014rises to \na threshold level and becomes a drive. A need can also be aroused by an external stimulus.

They can then develop marketing strategies and effective advertising cam -\npaigns that spark consumer interest. Increasing consumer motivation can be particularly important to \nencourage serious consideration of discretionary purchases such as luxury goods, vacation packages, and \nentertainment options. The drivers behind consumers\u2019 recognition of a need that they want fulfilled include \nfactors such as natural depletion \u2014e.g., the need to replace a regularly used item like toothpaste; dissatisfaction \nwith the current offering , which causes consumers to seek other means of fulfilling their need; lifestyle and goal \nchanges \u2014e.g., the birth of a child or a job promotion, which can have a significant impact on purchasing \nhabits; and social influences \u2014e.g., the opinions of family, friends, and colleagues or competition from peers.\nINFORMATION SEARCH\nSurprisingly, consumers often search for only limited information. Surveys have shown that half of \nall consumers look for durable goods at just one store, and a mere 30 percent look at more than one \nbrand of appliances. We can distinguish between two levels of engagement in the search. The milder \nsearch state is called heightened attention.  At this level a person simply becomes more receptive to infor -\nmation about a product. At the next level, the person may enter an active information search:  looking \nfor reading material, phoning friends, going online, and visiting stores to learn about the product.\nMarketers must understand what type of information consumers seek\u2014or are at least receptive \nto\u2014at different times and places. Unilever, in collaboration with Kroger, the largest U.S. retail grocery \nchain, has learned that meal planning goes through a three-step process: discussion of meals and what \nmight go into them (heightened attention), choice of exactly what will go into a particular meal (infor -\nmation search), and, finally, purchase. Monday, it turns out, is the critical meal-planning day for the \nweek ahead. Conversations at breakfast time tend to focus on health, but later in the day, at lunchtime, \ndiscussion centers more on how meals can be repurposed for leftovers.48\nInformation Sources.  Major information sources to which consumers turn fall into four groups: \npersonal , such as family, friends, neighbors, acquaintances; commercial , such as advertising, websites, \ne-mails, salespersons, dealers, packaging, displays; public , such as mass media, social media, consumer-\nrating organizations; and experiential , such as handling, examining, or using the product.\nThe relative amount of information obtained from these sources and their influence vary with the \nproduct category and the buyer\u2019s characteristics. Generally speaking, although consumers receive the \ngreatest amount of information about a product from commercial\u2014that is, marketer-dominated\u2014\nsources, the most effective information often comes from personal or experiential sources or public \nsources that are independent authorities.49 The ubiquity of social media has forever blurred the bound -\naries and widened the range of information sources. People sharing information about their purchases \non Facebook or writing product reviews on Amazon can be viewed by others as independent authori -\nties whose opinions carry great weight and far-ranging influence.\nEach source performs a different function in influencing the buying decision. Commercial sources \nnormally perform an information function, whereas personal sources perform a legitimizing or evalu -\nation function. For example, physicians often learn of new drugs from commercial sources but turn to \nother doctors for evaluations. Many consumers alternate between going online and offline (in stores) \nto learn about products and brands.\nConsumers rely on both internal and external information to help them arrive at a decision. Inter -\nnal information is based on one\u2019s own individual experiences. For example, an individual who wants \nto go out for dinner might recall having a great meal at a local Italian restaurant or seeing an ad for a \nrecently opened French bistro. External information sources are typically sought for high-involvement \ndecisions such as purchasing a car or buying a high-end appliance. External sources can include the \nsuggestions and opinions of family, friends, and work colleagues; making trips to dealers and searching \nonline to compare models and prices; and consulting sources like Consumer Reports .\nSearch Dynamics.

The process \nof identifying this attribute hierarchy is called market partitioning . Years ago, most car buyers first decided \non the manufacturer and then on one of its car divisions ( brand-dominant hierarchy ). A buyer might favor \nGeneral Motors cars and within this set choose a Chevrolet model. Today, many buyers decide first on \nthe nation or nations from which they want to buy a car ( nation-dominant hierarchy ). Buyers may first \ndecide they want to buy a German car and then opt for an Audi before zeroing in on the Audi A6.\nThe hierarchy of attributes also can reveal customer segments. Buyers who first decide on price \nare price dominant; those who first decide on the type of car (sedan, coupe, SUV, hybrid) are type \ndominant; those who choose the brand first are brand dominant. Type/price/brand-dominant con -\nsumers make up one segment; quality and service buyers make up another. Each segment may have \ndistinct demographics, psychographics, and behaviors, as well as different awareness, consideration, \nand choice sets.\nFigure 3.4 implies that a company must strategize to get its brand into the prospect\u2019s awareness, \nconsideration, and choice sets. If a food store owner arranges yogurt first by brand (such as Dannon \nand Yoplait) and then by flavor within each brand, consumers will tend to select their flavors from the \nsame brand. However, if all the strawberry yogurts are put together, then all the vanilla, and so forth, \nconsumers will probably choose the flavors they want first and then choose the brand they want for \nthat particular flavor.\nSearch behavior can vary online, in part because of the manner in which product information is \npresented. For example, product alternatives may be presented in order of their predicted attractive -\nness for consumers, who then may choose not to search as extensively as they otherwise would have.51 \nIncreasingly sophisticated recommendation engines use algorithms and data to uncover patterns in \nconsumer choices and recommend the most relevant offerings for a particular consumer\u2019s needs and \ninterests.\nAmazon\u2019s item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithm presents recommendations to custom -\ners based on product lines and subject areas that match a customer\u2019s purchases to similar products. \nThis involves the analysis of billions of data points derived from viewing online customer behavior, \nfrom purchase history to abandoned carts. Recommendations appear in several places: in personalized \nrecommendations and previously viewed products links, as well as in a \u201cFrequently Bought Together\u201d \nsection that helps Amazon cut delivery costs. Studies suggest that more than a third of consumer \npurchases on Amazon come from product recommendations.\nThe company must also identify the other brands in the consumer\u2019s choice set so that it can plan \nthe appropriate competitive appeals. In addition, marketers should identify the consumer\u2019s informa -\ntion sources and evaluate their relative importance. Asking consumers how they first heard about the \nbrand, what information they learned later, and the relative importance of these different information \nsources will help the company prepare effective communications for the target market. Digital market -\ning allows for easier detection and analysis of the other sites that are sending potential customers to \nthe company\u2019s website. For instance, Amazon\u2019s affiliate network shows which websites and blogs are \ndriving traffic not only to Amazon\u2019s site but also to specific products.\nEVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES\nThe way consumers decipher the pros and cons of available options is affected by the beliefs and \nattitudes they hold, whether these are valid or erroneous. These perceptions and the differing ways \nin which consumers process information weigh heavily in the purchase decision, as the following \nsections show.FIGURE 3.4 \nSuccessive Sets \nInvolved in Consumer \nDecision Making\nApple\nSamsung\nGoogle\nLG\nHTC\nHuawei\nOnePlusApple\nSamsung\nGoogle\nHTCApple\nSamsung\nGoogleApple\nGoogleAppleTotal Set Awareness Set Consideration Set Choice Choice Set", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4325, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33a3be3d-d3e7-4f97-8bb4-22955c9baaf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "33a3be3d-d3e7-4f97-8bb4-22955c9baaf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf070c42-3e99-425e-a33b-064933524be9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "10e96f4d46b4ddc70c3a13e8a779b36a5be768ad37d75554faadc5ab2a07ef1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b92afc6-90cd-4c04-b1d2-6a67b1b557da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "8d01a5f60d049f51cd1079f723afa3c4e61b6fa3069e932593954967cfc212db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b7f966e-3ea4-4416-9cc0-a196f85dff70", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3df79e1d290ceff3c4ea8e1269add8b2bddc04c565e8194d1d84fd7510a5c88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "68 PART  2   |  UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET\nBeliefs and Attitudes.  Through experience and learning, people acquire beliefs and attitudes. \nThese in turn influence buying behavior. A belief  is a conviction that something is true or real, regard -\nless of whether or not it is. Just as important are attitudes , a person\u2019s enduring favorable or unfavor -\nable evaluations, emotional feelings, and behavioral tendencies toward an object or idea. People have \nattitudes about almost everything: religion, politics, clothes, music, food.\nAttitudes put us into a frame of mind: liking or disliking an object, moving toward or away from \nit. They lead us to behave in a fairly consistent way toward similar objects. Because attitudes econo -\nmize on energy and thought, they can be very difficult to change. As a general rule, a company is well \nadvised to adapt its product to existing attitudes, rather than trying to change attitudes. If beliefs and \nattitudes become too negative, however, it may be necessary for the company to take more active steps.\nUnderstanding consumers\u2019 attitudes is beneficial for marketers, because attitudes may at times \npredict behavior during the consideration and choice set stages of the customer decision process. \nFor example, attitudes that are developed from interacting with a product during a trial can more \naccurately predict the likelihood of consumers purchasing the product than attitudes formed from \nexposure to a product ad.52\nInformation Processing.  How does the consumer process the information about the available \noptions and make a final value judgment? No single process is used by all consumers or by one con -\nsumer in all buying situations. The most current models see the consumer forming judgments largely \non a conscious and rational basis.\nSome basic concepts will help us understand the consumer evaluation process. First, the con -\nsumer is trying to satisfy a need. Second, the consumer is looking for certain benefits from the product \noffering a solution for that need. Third, the consumer sees each product as a bundle of attributes with \nvarying abilities to deliver the benefits desired. The attributes of interest to buyers vary by product: for \nexample, hotels \u2014location, cleanliness, atmosphere, price; mouthwash \u2014color, effectiveness, germ-killing \ncapability, taste/flavor, price; tires\u2014safety, tread life, ride quality, price. Consumers will pay the most \nattention to attributes that deliver the sought-after benefits. We can often segment the market for a \nproduct according to attributes and benefits important to different consumer groups.\nMore choice seems like a good thing, but this isn\u2019t always so\u2014particularly when a consumer \nhas no marked preferences or when no superior option exists in the awareness/consideration sets. \nNegligible differences among the options and time constraints further complicate the decision. Also, \nconsumers will expend brainpower, time, and effort only in proportion to the importance of the deci -\nsion task. The astute marketer must know when to reduce choice overload (and the cognitive effort \nimposed) by adding a superior option to the assortment (total set), reducing the amount of information \ncustomers must sift through, asking pertinent questions that aid in decision making, and alleviating \ntime constraints involving sales or special offers.\nExpectancy-Value Model.  The consumer arrives at attitudes toward various brands through \nan attribute-evaluation procedure, developing a set of beliefs about where each brand stands on each \nattribute.53 The expectancy-value model  of attitude formation posits that consumers evaluate \nproducts and services by combining their brand beliefs\u2014both positive and negative\u2014according to \nimportance.\nSuppose a consumer has narrowed her choice set to four laptops (A, B, C, and D).

If one computer dominated the \nothers on all the criteria, we could predict that this consumer would choose it. But, as is often the case, \nher choice set consists of brands that vary in their appeal. If she wants the best memory capacity, she \nshould buy C; if she wants the best graphics capability, she should buy A; and so on.\nIf we knew the weight this consumer attaches to each of the four attributes, we could more reliably \npredict her choice. Suppose she assigned 40 percent of the importance to the laptop\u2019s memory capac -\nity, 30 percent to graphics capability, 20 percent to size and weight, and 10 percent to price. To find \nthis consumer\u2019s perceived value for each laptop according to the expectancy-value model, we would \nmultiply these weights by her beliefs about each computer\u2019s attributes. This computation leads to the \nfollowing perceived values:\nLaptop A  =0.4(8)+0.3(9)+0.2(6)+0.1(9)=8.0\nLaptop B  =0.4(7)+0.3(7)+0.2(7)+0.1(7)=7.0\nLaptop C  =0.4(10)+0.3(4)+0.2(3)+0.1(2)=6.0\nLaptop D  =0.4(5)+0.3(3)+0.2(8)+0.1(5)=5.0\nAn expectancy-model formulation predicts that this consumer will favor Laptop A, which (at 8.0) \nhas the highest perceived value.54 The expectancy-value model implies several strategies that a com -\npany can use to increase the probability that consumers will choose its offering. Suppose most laptop \nbuyers form their preferences the same way. Knowing this, the marketer of Laptop B, for example, could \napply the following strategies to stimulate greater interest in Brand B. First, the company might choose \nto redesign the laptop\u2014for example, by changing its functional attributes, modifying its form, and \nimproving service. Alternatively, the company can alter consumers\u2019 beliefs about the laptop, without \nnecessarily modifying the laptop itself, by better communicating its benefits. The company might \nalso alter consumers\u2019 beliefs about competitors\u2019 offerings by communicating the drawbacks of the \ncompetitive products. Finally, the company might alter consumers\u2019 beliefs about the importance of \nthe different product attributes by persuading buyers to attach more weight to the attributes in which \nthe brand excels.55\nPURCHASE DECISION\nIn the evaluation stage, the consumer forms preferences among the brands in the choice set and may \nalso form an intention to buy the most preferred brand. In executing a purchase intention, the con -\nsumer may make as many as five purchase decisions: brand (Brand A), distribution channel (Retailer X),  \nquantity (one computer), timing (weekend), and payment method (credit card). This decision com -\nplexity often leads consumers to use mental shortcuts, or heuristics.\nDecision Heuristics.  The expectancy-value model is a compensatory model, in that perceived \ngood things about a product can help to overcome perceived bad things. Thus, even though Brand A \nin the previous example lacked the graphics capability of Brand C, had the second lowest size/weight \nevaluation, and was more expensive than any other brand, its overall memory and graphics capacity \nwon out relative to the other computers in the choice set. With non-compensatory models of consumer \nchoice, positive and negative attribute considerations don\u2019t necessarily net out. Evaluating attributes in \nisolation facilitates decision making for consumers, but it also increases the likelihood that they would \nhave made a different choice if they had deliberated in greater detail.\nRather than calculating the perceived importance of every attribute across products in a con -\nsideration set, consumers often take \u201cmental shortcuts,\u201d called heuristics  or rules of thumb, in the \ndecision process. This is especially true when people are short on time or cognitive resources.56 Our \nbrand or product knowledge, the number and similarity of brand choices, time pressures, and the social \ncontext (such as the need for justification to a peer or boss) may affect whether and how we use choice \nheuristics.

The expectancy-value model assumes a high level \nof consumer involvement and active processing by the consumer in response to a marketing stimulus. \nRichard Petty and John Cacioppo\u2019s elaboration likelihood model , an influential model of attitude \nformation and change, describes how consumers make evaluations in both low- and high-involvement \ncircumstances.58\nThere are two means of persuasion in their model: the central route , in which attitude formation or \nchange stimulates much thought and is based on the consumer\u2019s diligent, rational consideration of the \nmost important product information; and the peripheral route , in which attitude formation or change \nprovokes much less thought and results from the consumer\u2019s association of a brand with either posi -\ntive or negative peripheral cues. Peripheral cues  for consumers might include a celebrity endorsement, \na credible source, or any object that generates strong emotional response.\nConsumers follow the central route only if they possess sufficient motivation, ability, and oppor -\ntunity. In other words, they must want to evaluate a brand in detail, have the necessary brand and \nproduct or service knowledge in memory, and have sufficient time and the proper setting. If any of \nthose factors is lacking, consumers tend to follow the peripheral route and consider less central, more \nextrinsic factors in their decisions. We buy many products under conditions of low involvement and \nwithout significant brand differences. Consider salt. If consumers keep reaching for the same brand in \nthis category, it may be out of habit, not strong brand loyalty.\nEvidence suggests there is low involvement with most low-cost, frequently purchased products. \nLow-involvement products carry little cost or risk and are not well differentiated, which also means \nthat it\u2019s easy for consumers to switch to other products in this category or indulge in impulse buying \nto satisfy their need for variety. Marketers can boost habituation to the purchase of these products by \nstressing quality and brand affiliation and by ensuring effective distribution so that consumers aren\u2019t \nforced to look elsewhere if, for example, their usual bath gel or soap is not available.\nMarketers use four techniques to try to convert a low-involvement product into one that encour -\nages higher involvement. First, they can link the product to an engaging issue, as when Crest linked its \ntoothpaste to cavity prevention. Second, they can link the product to a personal situation\u2014for example,  \nfruit juice makers began to include vitamins and calcium to fortify their drinks. Third, marketers \nmight design advertising to trigger strong emotions related to personal values or ego defense, as when \ncereal makers began to advertise to adults the heart-healthy nature of cereals and the importance of \n living a long time to enjoy family life. Fourth, they might add an important feature\u2014for example, GE\u2019s \n introduction of \u201cSoft White\u201d lightbulbs. These strategies at best raise consumer involvement from a low \nto a moderate level: They do not necessarily propel the consumer into highly involved buying behavior.\nIf consumers have low involvement with a purchase decision regardless of what the marketer does, \nthey are likely to follow the peripheral route. Marketers must give consumers one or more positive cues \nto justify their brand choice, such as frequent ad repetition, visible sponsorships, and vigorous PR to \nenhance brand familiarity. Other peripheral cues that can tip the balance in favor of the brand include \na beloved celebrity endorser, attractive packaging, and an appealing promotion.\nIntervening Factors.  Even if consumers form an evaluation, two general factors can intervene \nbetween the purchase intention and the purchase decision (see Figure 3.5). The first factor is the attitudes \nof others.  The degree to which we\u2019re influenced by another person\u2019s attitude depends on two factors: \n(1)\u00a0the intensity of the other person\u2019s attitude toward our preferred alternative and (2) our motivation \nto comply with the other person\u2019s wishes.59 The more intense the other person\u2019s attitude and the closer \nhe or she is to us, the more we will adjust our purchase intention.

The consumer might lose her job before she purchases a laptop, some other pur -\nchase might become more urgent, or a store salesperson might turn her off. Preferences and even \npurchase intentions are not completely reliable predictors of purchase behavior.\nA consumer\u2019s decision to modify, postpone, or avoid a purchase decision is heavily influenced by \none or more types of perceived risk.61 These involve the functional risk  that the product does not perform \nto expectations, the physical risk  that the product poses a threat to the physical well-being or health of \nthe user or others, the financial risk  that the product is not worth the price paid, the social risk  that the \nproduct results in embarrassment in front of others, the psychological risk  that the product affects the \nmental well-being of the user, and the opportunity risk  that the failure of the product results in spending \nmore time and money to find another, more satisfactory product.\nThe degree of perceived risk varies with the amount of money at stake, the amount of attribute \nuncertainty, and the level of consumer self-confidence. Consumers develop routines for reducing the \nuncertainty and negative consequences of risk, such as avoiding decisions, gathering information from \nfriends, and developing preferences for national brand names and warranties.62 Marketers must under -\nstand the factors that provoke a feeling of risk in consumers and provide information and support to \nreduce it.\nPOSTPURCHASE BEHAVIOR\nAfter the purchase, the consumer might experience dissonance from noticing certain disquieting \nfeatures or hearing favorable things about other brands and will be alert to information that supports \nhis or her decision. Marketing communications should supply beliefs and evaluations that reinforce \nthe consumer\u2019s choice and help her or him feel good about the brand. The marketer\u2019s job doesn\u2019t end \nwith the purchase. Marketers must monitor postpurchase satisfaction, postpurchase actions, and \npostpurchase product uses and disposal.\nSatisfaction is a function of the closeness between consumer expectations and the product\u2019s per -\nceived performance.63 If performance falls short of expectations, the consumer is disappointed; if it \nmeets expectations, the consumer is satisfied; if it exceeds expectations, the consumer is delighted. \nThese feelings make a difference in whether the customer buys the product again and talks favor -\nably or unfavorably about it to others. The larger the gap between expectations and performance, the \ngreater the dissatisfaction. This is where the consumer\u2019s coping style comes into play. Some consumers \nmagnify the gap when the product isn\u2019t perfect and are highly dissatisfied; others minimize it and are \nless dissatisfied.\nSatisfaction influences customers\u2019 postpurchase actions . A satisfied consumer is more likely to pur -\nchase the product again and will also tend to say good things about the brand to others. In fact, one \ncan argue that the highest level of success is achieved when a customer becomes an advocate and \nrecommends the company\u2019s offering to others. Dissatisfied consumers may abandon or return the \nproduct. They may take public action by complaining to the company, going to a lawyer, complaining \ndirectly to other groups (such as business, private, or government organizations), or expressing their \ndissatisfaction to others online. Private actions include deciding to stop buying the product (exit option) \nor warning friends (voice option).64\nPostpurchase communications to buyers have been shown to result in fewer product returns and \norder cancellations.

Another is to offer the product on a subscription basis like Dollar Shave Club, whose razors \nare shipped monthly, and Quip, which delivers its electric toothbrush head refills every three months. \nCompanies send monthly boxes to subscribers containing a variety of related products in areas that \nrange from cosmetics (Birchbox) to clothing (Le Tote), food (Blue Apron), and dog care (BarkBox).\nAnother strategy is to provide consumers with better information about when they need to \nreplace the product to sustain its current level of performance. Batteries have built-in gauges that \nshow how much power they have left; razors have colored lubricating strips to indicate when blades \nmay be worn; toothbrushes have colored bristles to indicate wear; and so on.

These systematic errors, also referred \nto as decision biases , are particularly common in complex Consumers don\u2019t always process information or make \ndecisions in a deliberate, rational manner. one of the most \nactive academic research areas in marketing over the \npast three decades has been behavioral decision theory, \nwhich studies how consumers make decisions in these \n situations.

Mental accounting is based on a set of core \nprinciples:\n\u2022 Consumers tend to segregate gains.  When a seller \nhas a product with more than one positive dimension, \nit\u2019s desirable to have the consumer evaluate each \ndimension separately. listing the multiple benefits of \na large industrial product, for example, can make the \nsum of the parts seem greater than the whole.\n\u2022 Consumers tend to integrate losses.  Marketers have \na distinct advantage in selling something if its cost \ncan be added to another large purchase. For exam-\nple, house buyers are more inclined to view additional \nexpenditures favorably given the already high price of \nbuying a house.\n\u2022 Consumers tend to integrate smaller losses with \nlarger gains.  The \u201ccancellation\u201d principle might \nexplain why withholding taxes from monthly pay -\nchecks is less painful than making large, lump-\nsum tax payments: The smaller withholdings are \nmore likely to be overshadowed by the larger pay \namount.\n\u2022 Consumers tend to segregate small gains from large \nlosses.  The \u201csilver lining\u201d principle might explain the \npopularity of rebates on big-ticket purchases such \nas\u00a0cars.\nConsider a choice between two scenarios. In \n Scenario A, you spend $50 to buy a ticket for a  concert. \nAs you arrive at the show, you realize you\u2019ve lost \nyour ticket. you decide to buy a replacement. And in \n Scenario\u00a0B, you decide to buy a ticket to a concert at \nthe door. As you arrive at the show, you realize somehow \nyou lost $50 along the way. you decide to buy the ticket \nanyway.\nWhich loss would you feel less keenly? Most people \nchoose Scenario B. Although the loss is the same, in the \nfirst case you may have mentally allocated $50 for the \nconcert, and buying another ticket would exceed your \nmental concert budget. In the second case, the money \nyou lost did not belong to any account, so you have not \nexceeded any mental budget.66decisions when consumers have limited information while \nfacing time constraints. Some of the most common deci-\nsion heuristics are outlined below.\n\u2022 The availability heuristic  reflects people\u2019s tendency to \njudge that an event is more likely to occur if they can \nrecall more instances of that event. For example, if \nasked whether more people in the United States die \nfrom homicide or emphysema, most people would \nattribute a greater number of deaths to homicide \nbecause it more easily comes to mind (news media \ngive more coverage to homicide than to emphysema), \neven though in reality emphysema causes more \ndeaths than homicide.\n\u2022 The representativeness heuristic  reflects people\u2019s \ntendency to judge the likelihood of an event occurring \nbased on the degree to which this event is similar to \nthe category it represents. A pale, meek, quiet person \nwearing glasses is more likely to be considered a \ncomputer geek than an active, outgoing, and outspo-\nken one. This heuristic leads to a number of decision \nbiases, including base-rate neglect, which ignores the \nactual probability of an event occurring.\n\u2022 The conjunction fallacy  results from people\u2019s errone-\nous belief that the probability of two events occur -\nring jointly is greater than the probability of either \nevent occurring independently. A classic example of \nthe conjunction fallacy provided respondents with \na description of linda as bright, outspoken, and \nconcerned with discrimination and social justice as \na student.

Understanding consumer motivation begins with \nunderstanding the needs that consumers aim to fulfill \nwith their actions. Some needs are biological and arise \nfrom physiological states of tension such as hunger, \nthirst, or discomfort. Other needs are psychological \nand arise from psychological states of tension such as \nthe need for recognition, esteem, or belonging. A need \nbecomes a motivation when it is aroused to a sufficient \nlevel of intensity to drive us to act. Motivation has both \ndirection and intensity.\n5. Perception is the process by which we select, organize, \nand interpret information inputs to create a meaningful \npicture of the world. In marketing, perceptions are more \nimportant than reality because they affect consumers\u2019 \nactual behavior. People emerge with different percep -\ntions of the same object because of three perceptual \nprocesses: selective attention, selective distortion, and \nselective retention.\n6. Consumer response is not all cognitive and rational; \nmuch may be emotional and evoke different kinds of \nfeelings. Emotions are mental states that arise sponta -\nneously rather than from conscious effort and reflect \npeople\u2019s positive or negative reactions to internal and \nexternal stimuli.\nSource: Bob Pool/Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5363cbe7-13c2-43f5-8101-8163d966b13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5363cbe7-13c2-43f5-8101-8163d966b13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "457a9602-8b98-41ab-a9be-4ee8044a15c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "c8fe88b38b457379673953b10a3f4f48c11887dd1a425c393ccec26ac620e142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "210d0303-d958-41d1-9ec9-8c6baab32fe3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "data/Chap3.pdf"}, "hash": "197cb9c7b7c7d208b1ef5143a0d262298dc79ca259ab5476958d7bae34ffbe46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9c007fc-29de-47bf-b75f-62481d25f2d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a9d7ab46065a8466de288ea6a67c5f739fab489f2208c499aa9b5eca4804aaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 3    |  ANAlyzING CoNSUMER  MARKETS  75\ntop of U.S. News & World Report \u2019s Best Hospitals list and \nenjoys over 80 percent brand recognition among U.S. adults. \nMayo Clinic has reached this level of success by taking a dif-\nferent approach from most clinics and hospitals and placing \nunwavering focus on the patient experience. The clinic\u2019s two \ninterrelated core values can be traced back to its founders \nand are at the heart of all the organization does: placing the \npatient\u2019s interests above all others and practicing teamwork.\nEvery aspect of the patient experience is considered \nat Mayo Clinic\u2019s three campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; \nScottsdale, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida. From the \nmoment patients walk into one of Mayo Clinic\u2019s facilities, they \nexperience something entirely different.\nIt all starts with Mayo Clinic\u2019s greeters, who welcome \nnew patients into the building and walk them through the \nadministrative process. Returning patients are greeted by \nname with a warm smile. The buildings and facilities them-\nselves are designed and built with the needs of patients in \nmind. one architect explained that the buildings are meant \nto make \u201cpatients feel a little better before they see their \ndoctors.\u201d For example, the lobby of the Mayo Clinic hospital \nin Scottsdale has an indoor waterfall and a wall of windows \noverlooking mountains.\nThe 21-story Gonda Building in Rochester is Mayo \nClinic\u2019s headquarters of sorts and where people from around \nthe world come for medical help. The building has spectacu-\nlar wide-open spaces, boasts huge windows reaching to the \nsky, and hosts Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Innovation, where \nmany of Mayo\u2019s cutting-edge ideas come to life. The Center \nfor Innovation was created with the mission of \u201cTransforming \nthe Delivery and Experience of Health Care.\u201d In order to come \nup with ideas that will accomplish this lofty goal, Center \nemployees observe patients, interview families, and conduct \nresearch, as well as test and model possible solutions. For \nexample, when Mayo Clinic called for a major room innova-\ntion, the Center for Innovation used prototype exam rooms \nin a flexible space so employees and patients could test the \nnew layouts and discover the most efficient and patient-\nfriendly environment. The resulting design was called \u201cJack \nand Jill rooms,\u201d a concept that separated the exam space \nfrom the conversation space. Two conversation rooms are \nnow located on either side of the exam room and accessed \nby internal doors. This design benefits both patients and phy-\nsicians, who like having a separate place to talk away from \nmedical tools and equipment and the space to accommodate \nfamily members. In addition, physicians found it beneficial \nnot to have furniture in the exam room.\nThe other significant difference in serving patients is \nMayo Clinic\u2019s concept of teamwork. A patient can come \nto Mayo Clinic with or without a physician\u2019s referral. At the \ntime of arrival, the patient\u2019s team is assembled; it can be \ncomposed of any blend of medical professionals, including the primary physician, surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, \nnurses, residents, or other specialists with the appropriate \nskill, experience, and knowledge.\nTeams of medical professionals work together to diag-\nnose each patient\u2019s medical problems. This can involve \nanalyzing and debating test results for hours in order to \ndetermine the most accurate diagnosis and most effective \ntreatments. once a team consensus has been reached, \nthe leader meets with the patient and discusses his or her \noptions. Throughout the process, patients are encouraged \nto take part in the discussion. If surgery is necessary, the \nprocedure is often scheduled to take place within 24 hours, \na dramatic difference from the long wait that patients experi-\nence at many other hospitals. Mayo Clinic\u2019s doctors under -\nstand that those who seek their care want action as soon as \npossible.\nMayo\u2019s doctors are on salary instead of being paid by \nthe number of patients seen or tests ordered. As a result, \npatients receive more individualized attention and care, and \nphysicians work together instead of against one another.

In addition, consumers are \ninterviewed over the phone and are often asked to view new \ndesign concepts on the internet. The company also conducts \nextensive ongoing research to learn more about the future \ntrends affecting small businesses. Intuit uses what it learns to \nimprove versions of its products each year and better under -\nstand the next generation of financial and tax software.\nThis in-depth research has led to innovative new products \nand services in recent years. For example, Intuit employees \nwatched younger consumers get frustrated using an Intuit \ntax software program because they couldn\u2019t complete their \ntaxes via their mobile device. This frustration and Intuit\u2019s keen \nempathy for the consumer led to the development of the tax \napp SnapTax. The program automatically recognizes the data \nfrom consumers\u2019 W-2 forms and inputs these data directly \ninto TurboTax. SnapTax was the first tool to allow people to \ncompletely prepare and e-file federal and state returns from \ntheir smartphones. Consumer response was overwhelming: \nWithin two weeks of its release, SnapTax had replaced Angry \nBirds as the number-one app on iTunes.\nRealizing the importance of streamlining the data entry \nprocess, Intuit acquired Mint\u2014an online personal finance \nmanagement service that enabled customers to enter their \nbank password and download all their spending informa-\ntion automatically, eliminating data entry and showing them \na pie-chart view of their finances. Following the acquisi-\ntion, Intuit incorporated many of Mint\u2019s features into its own \nsoftware, reducing the \u201ctime to pie,\u201d the number of minutes \nbetween when customers begin using a program and when \nthey see the first payoff\u2014clear, well-presented budgets and \npie charts. Understanding that tax preparation is an effortful \nand highly emotional process, Intuit begun to focus not only \non software functionality but also on the emotional payoff by \nreducing effort and speeding up the process by which cus-\ntomers receive their tax refunds.Intuit\nIntuit develops and sells financial, accounting, and tax prepa-\nration software and related services for small businesses, \naccountants, and individual consumers.

After some favorable \nreviews in the trade journals and an effective print advertising \ncampaign that featured a 1-800 number, the company got \nits first break.
