than 40 countries and \nterritories. Founded in Denver, Colorado, in 1887 with the primary goal of collecting funds for local \ncharities, United Way has expanded its operations, partnering with other organizations that share its \nvision to make a lasting difference and achieve a meaningful impact. United Way focuses its efforts \non programs delivering measurable outcomes that benefit specific communities, rather than merely \nraising funds to support various activities. To achieve its mission, United Way brings people, organi -\nzations, and communities together around a common cause, a common vision, and a common path \nforward. For example, United Way joined forces with H&R Block, the Walmart Foundation, Goodwill \nIndustries, and the National Disability Institute to launch a campaign connecting low-income house -\nholds with free tax preparation services and now helps more people file taxes for free than any other \norganization. United Way also successfully petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to \ndesignate 2-1-1 as a health and human services information hotline to help people find local sup -\nport and services in times of crisis. Over time, 2-1-1 has become an essential resource, providing \nemergency assistance for victims and relief for U.S. communities devastated by hurricanes, floods, Healthy long-term growth for a brand requires marketers to engage in a host of marketing activi -\nties and satisfy a broad set of constituents and objectives. In doing so, marketers must also \nconsider the societal impact of their actions. Corporate social responsibility has become a priority \nfor many organizations and is ingrained in their business models. Some organizations, such as United \nWay, fully embrace this vision of social responsibility.Socially Responsible Marketing21\nUnited Way \nsupplements its \nfund-raising activities \nby partnering with \ncorporations to \ndeliver meaningful \nservices that address \nthe needs of specific \ncommunities. \nSource: Courtesy of \nUnited\u00a0Way", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2fde5e3-0a76-4a39-ad3c-c2696ffbd32d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2fde5e3-0a76-4a39-ad3c-c2696ffbd32d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0715dc6-8883-4d36-ac99-63b105a0854f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "dd272d077c24b96e2f256d2a2fe7c9cd8efcc53cee398795cea651cf2f243ff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f47152b-b213-47c3-8896-faef6e9d9a6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "a877f4559d0ac10a5cc81887455b3783bd856996146bf706384d03fb07c4ef9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2b1791e-d01f-42ac-8de2-b96e4dd7c524", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3f254fa410deabc8eb7135a02ea0d9ff4948523d87f7c7d4cff969561a94f85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "465\nPART 7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nmudslides, tornadoes, and other disasters.

Moreover, working together, both companies were able to create a \nplatform based on Salesforce\u2019s artificial intelligence functionality that can be used across differ -\nent nonprofit organizations.

In this chapter, we consider the societal impact of a company\u2019s \nmarketing activities and examine the key dimensions of corporate social responsibility.\nThe Role of Social Responsibility \nin\u00a0Marketing Management\nEffective marketing must be matched by a strong sense of ethics, values, and social responsibility. \nAccording to the 2016 PwC Global CEO Survey, 64 percent of CEOs believe that \u201ccorporate social \nresponsibility is core to their business rather than just an adjunct stand-alone program.\u201d2 Taking a \nmore active, strategic role in corporate social responsibility is thought to benefit not just customers, \nemployees, the community, and the environment but also shareholders.\nCompanies engage in prosocial activities and invest in corporate social responsibility for a variety \nof reasons. Some do it because creating societal benefits is a key element of the corporate culture and \nthe company\u2019s value system. Others do it to differentiate themselves by appealing to consumers who \nfavor companies that exhibit civic virtues. Some do it at the insistence of their collaborators, who prefer \nto deal with companies that care about creating value for society. Yet others do it to build a bank of pub -\nlic goodwill to offset potential criticisms and deal with eventual marketing crises. And some companies \nengage in corporate social responsibility to increase employee loyalty and create investor goodwill.\nThe most admired\u2014and most successful\u2014companies in the world abide by high standards of \nbusiness and marketing conduct that dictate serving consumer interests as well as their own. Procter \n& Gamble has made \u201cbrand purpose\u201d a key component of the company\u2019s marketing strategies.

In this context, social justice advocates \nand environmentalists have brought a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness \nby introducing societal and environmental benefits as key components of a company\u2019s bottom line. \nThus, many companies focus on the so-called triple bottom line \u2014people (social component), planet \n(sustainability component), and profit (monetary component).\nThe concept of a triple bottom line implies that a company's responsibility lies with stakehold -\ners, all entities directly or indirectly influenced by the actions of the company, rather than just with \nshareholders, who actually own the firm. These stakeholders can include, in addition to the sharehold -\ners, company employees and customers, as well as the society at large. We examine how companies \nengage in corporate social responsibility in these three areas\u2014community, sustainability, and market \nprofit\u2014in the following sections.\nCommunity-Based Corporate Social \nResponsibility\nHealthy long-term growth requires marketers to satisfy a broad set of constituents and objectives. \nIn this context, an important goal involves creating value for the community in which a company \noperates. There are several domains in which community-based corporate social responsibility typi -\ncally occurs: improving the workplace, engaging in corporate philanthropy, supporting low-income \ncommunities, fostering cause marketing, and engaging in social marketing. We discuss the different \ntypes of community-based corporate social responsibility in the following sections.\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WORKPLACE\nAn important aspect of corporate social responsibility involves creating an environment that ensures \nfair and ethical treatment of employees consistent with the societal norms. Specifically, to implement \ncorporate social responsibility in the workplace, companies typically focus on the following areas:\n\u2022 Fair compensation  that offers wages consistent with the industry norms and is sufficient to meet \nbasic living requirements.Stonyfield Farm  Stonyfield Farm was cofounded in 1983 \nby long-time \u201cCE-Yo\u201d Gary Hirshberg in the belief that there was \na business opportunity in selling all-natural organic dairy products \nwhile \u201crestoring the environment.\u201d The company\u2019s suppliers \navoid productivity practices of agribusiness, such as the use of \nantibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, and fertilizers. After \ncalculating the amount of energy used to run its plant, Stonyfield \ndecided to make an equivalent investment in environmental \nprojects such as reforestation, wind farms, and the company\u2019s \nown anaerobic wastewater digester. Stonyfield has modified \nthe plastic lids on its yogurt, saving about 1 million pounds of \nplastic a year, and has added on-package messages about global \nwarming, the perils of hormones, and genetically modified foods. \nIt also donates 10 percent of profits \u201cto efforts that help protect \nand restore the Earth.\u201d Although premium-priced, the brand still \nlacks the scale for mass market advertising campaigns and relies \non sampling (such as at the Boston marathon), publicity, and \nword of mouth. Its progressive business practices have not hurt \nits financial performance. Stonyfield is the number-three yogurt \nbrand in the United States and sells smoothies, milk, frozen \nyogurt, and ice cream. Hirshberg has also launched the nonprofit \n\u201cClimate Counts\u201d foundation that annually scores and informs \nconsumers about companies\u2019 voluntary actions to reverse climate \nchange in order to spur corporate responsibility.4\n>> In addition to \nusing only organically \nminded suppliers for its \norganic dairy products, \nStonyfield Farm \ninvests in sustainable \npractices and donates \n10 percent of profits to \nenvironmental causes. \nSource: Keith Homan/Shutterstock", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4009, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34a560e4-0e8b-4b93-9d54-40e16fc969bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "34a560e4-0e8b-4b93-9d54-40e16fc969bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7afee765-b7b6-4c2d-8e4f-a8394cdaf4a9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "03eb4b1fab9c2635706b303e1a629019e2ad1cea082ff2f9563cac0a8d469e25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2b1791e-d01f-42ac-8de2-b96e4dd7c524", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "824d3c96ecc91849691a9d680283f2fae3f9619d6b8bbb74b1f41837b652894c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "645af3d3-806c-4c3f-a0ee-e0086d885ff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8bc9dac1ef3d4e1ad91b36505bdf94b71deefac4715e32eb544792957a89702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 21    |  SOCIA llY RESpONSIB lE MARKETING  467\n\u2022 Work\u2013life balance  that ensures employees can allocate time to other aspects of their lives\u2014family, \npersonal interests, socializing, and leisure activities.\n\u2022 Diversity  that is promoted by avoiding artificial barriers or distinctions based on factors such as \nrace, ethnicity, religion, and culture.\n\u2022 A safe and healthful  working environment that protects employees against workplace violence and \nwork-related illnesses.\n\u2022 Employee development  that is fostered by investing resources in training and advancing employees.\nInvesting in corporate social responsibility can pay off. Bob Stiller, founder of Green Mountain \nCoffee Roasters (renamed Keurig Green Mountain in 2014 and Keurig Dr Pepper in 2018), has said \nthat \u201cpeople are motivated and more willing to go the extra mile to make the company successful \nwhen there\u2019s a higher good associated with it.\u201d5 Indeed, if employees think that the company takes the \nprinciples of corporate social responsibility to heart, they are more likely to do so themselves. This, \nin turn, is likely to promote closer relationships among employees and a greater sense of identity with \nthe company. Commitment to socially responsible causes is also likely to increase a company\u2019s ability \nto recruit, motivate, and retain key employees, for many of whom the social responsibility component \ncan be as important as the financial compensation.\nImplementing workplace corporate social responsibility programs cannot be accomplished by a \ncompany\u2019s management alone. It must reflect employees\u2019 needs and preferences and ensure that the \nemployees are on board and engaged in the company\u2019s efforts to improve the workplace environment. \nCreating a great corporate culture that reflects societal values can pay off for companies that stand \nbehind their corporate social responsibility initiatives.\nFirms of Endearment  The term Firms of Endearment \u2014coined by Raj Sisodia, David \nWolfe, and Jag Sheth\u2014refers to companies that succeed in doing well by doing good. These \ncompanies have a culture of caring that serves the interests of their stakeholders, defined \nby the acronym S pICE: Society, partners, Investors, Customers, and Employees. Using this \napproach, these firms create a sort of love affair with stakeholders. Their senior managers have \nan open-door policy, are passionate about customers, and earn modest compensation. They \npay their employees more, relate more closely to a smaller group of excellent suppliers, and \ngive back to the communities in which they work. They actually spend less on marketing as \na percentage of sales yet earn greater profits, because customers who love the company do \nmost of the marketing. By becoming beloved organizations, these companies create value for all \nstakeholders.6\nTreating employees fairly and ethically is particularly important for businesses that operate in \ninternational locations with labor laws that differ from those in the United States. Applying the same \nprinciples to their global subsidiaries and business partners as to their home-based operations is a \nmark of an organization that has truly embraced the principles of corporate social responsibility. One \norganization that helps companies find socially responsible business partners in developing countries \nand ensures that they follow sustainable business practices is Fairtrade.\nFairtrade  The Fairtrade Foundation aims to empower producers in developing countries, \nadvance social fairness, and enhance environmental standards. It promotes sustainable \ndevelopment by advocating for better trading conditions for small producers and workers \nin developing countries. Fairtrade focuses primarily on commodities such as coffee, cocoa, \nwine, sugar, fruits, chocolate, flowers, gold, and home goods that are frequently exported \nto developed countries. An important aspect of the fair-trade movement is that buyers of \nFairtrade goods pay the producers a social premium that usually goes toward sustainability \nand socioeconomic development. Fairtrade\u2019s core principles include (1) income sustainability , \nmeaning that earnings should fulfill basic household needs regardless of volatile market prices; \n(2) empowerment , meaning that producers have the ability to make decisions based on their \nown interests; (3) individual and community well-being , meaning that producers can decide \nhow to invest the Fairtrade premium based on their own and their community\u2019s needs; and \n(4)\u00a0environmental stewardship , meaning that sustainable practices are used in order to protect \nnatural resources.7", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4624, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "645af3d3-806c-4c3f-a0ee-e0086d885ff0": {"__data__": {"id_": "645af3d3-806c-4c3f-a0ee-e0086d885ff0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50c59a9d-b230-47b5-8544-0b81b0bb9841", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "732db5ae7b501ca3c190f78474552735e47a703e4cd2e381ba0128caf664b471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "34a560e4-0e8b-4b93-9d54-40e16fc969bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "2e5a8f3c7702e633593e076736d52782b13550fec7598c31ec55a452d31792c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae568cb5-43ec-4925-b409-d72fafbca27d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f861188e4b7d2d7996372abb1551782c3cd1896fd7050e284b14fcf489a2a8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "468 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nCORPORATE PHILANTHROPY\nCorporate philanthropy as a whole is on the rise, as more firms come to believe that corporate social \nresponsibility in the form of cause marketing and employee volunteerism programs are not just the \n\u201cright thing\u201d but also the \u201csmart thing to do.\u201d8\nCompanies such as The Body Shop, Working Assets, and Smith & Hawken are also giving social \nresponsibility a more prominent role, as is Newman\u2019s Own. Late actor Paul Newman\u2019s homemade salad \ndressing venture has grown into a huge business that includes pasta sauce, salsa, popcorn, and lemon -\nade and is now sold in 15 overseas markets. The company gives away all its profits and royalties after \ntax\u2014more than $400 million so far\u2014to thousands of educational and charitable programs worldwide, \nincluding the Hole in the Wall Gang camps that Newman created for children with serious illnesses.9\nMcDonald\u2019s has focused on children and family health and well-being through four major \nprograms:10\nRonald McDonald Houses  in 35 countries and regions offer more than 8,000 rooms each \nnight to families that need support while their child is in the hospital, saving them a total of \n$657\u00a0  million annually in hotel costs. Ronald McDonald Family Rooms  in 23 countries furnish \n4,000 families each day with a place to rest and regroup at the hospital next to their sick child. \nIn nine countries, 52 Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles  provide neighborhood on-site medical \ncare for children. And Ronald McDonald House Charities  has awarded more than $100 million \nin funding through its Global Grants Program to nonprofits to extend its reach and impact \nchildren\u2019s health and well-being worldwide.\nThe growth of corporate giving raises the question of the ultimate impact of corporate philan -\nthropy on a company\u2019s market performance. Researchers have argued that corporate giving can have \na positive impact in at least three domains: enhancing company image, enhancing customer loyalty, \nand enhancing perceived product performance.\nIt has been shown that consumers view companies engaged in corporate philanthropy as being \nwarmer, more compassionate, more ethical, more likable and trustworthy, and less blameworthy in the \nmidst of corporate crises.11 It has further been shown that a company\u2019s reputation for social respon -\nsibility tends to enhance consumer loyalty, increase customer satisfaction, decrease consumer price \nsensitivity, and increase their brand commitment.12 It also has been argued that a company\u2019s socially \nresponsible behavior is likely to increase product sales by motivating consumers to reward a company \nfor its prosocial behavior and giving consumers the opportunity to attain moral satisfaction from the \n\u201cwarm glow of giving.\u201d13>> The Fairtrade \nFoundation focuses on \npromoting commodities \nfrom small producers \nto enhance income, \nsocial fairness, and \n environmental standards \nin developing nations. \nSource: Realimage/Alamy Stock photo", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2979, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae568cb5-43ec-4925-b409-d72fafbca27d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae568cb5-43ec-4925-b409-d72fafbca27d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a558f1c9-6648-4402-af1b-17df49960fc8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "563fbb64f8c9fdcee9f1fd28fc3bff29856ce10bf8ca8365c3754cd3b5454399", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "645af3d3-806c-4c3f-a0ee-e0086d885ff0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "data/Chap21.pdf"}, "hash": "732db5ae7b501ca3c190f78474552735e47a703e4cd2e381ba0128caf664b471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a90d19d7-aad3-49cd-ad11-ed7b22b0de7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4df86758b0faffb05f117265c9be2155d6684844b55a252ebf347920e1e2a62e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 21    |  SOCIA llY RESpONSIB lE MARKETING  469\nIn addition to documenting the positive impact of social goodwill on company image and con -\nsumer loyalty, recent research suggests that the positive effect of corporate social responsibility can \nextend to perceptions of the performance of its products, such that products of companies engaged in \ncharitable giving are likely to be perceived as having higher levels of performance.14 Thus, doing good \ncan indeed help companies do well.\nCorporate philanthropy also can pose dilemmas. Merck, DuPont, Walmart, and Bank of  America \nhave each donated $100 million or even more to charities annually. Yet good deeds can be overlooked\u2014\neven resented\u2014if the company is seen as exploitive or fails to live up to a \u201cgood guy\u201d image.

The importance of addressing the \nneeds of the world\u2019s poorest citizens was most prominently underscored by business writer C. K. Prahalad, \nwho believed that much innovation can come from developments in emerging markets such as China and \nIndia.15 Firms operating in those markets are forced to innovate in order to be able to do more with less.\nSatisfying the bottom of the pyramid also requires careful planning and execution. Although they \nmay collectively be worth several trillion dollars, each individual low-income consumer may have very \nlittle to spend. Conventional wisdom says a \u201clow-price, low-margin, high-volume\u201d business model is \nthe key to successfully appealing to lower-income consumers in developing markets. Although there \nare some good examples of such a strategy\u2014Hindustan Unilever with Wheel detergent in India, for \none\u2014others have struggled. Procter & Gamble launched its Pur water-purification product in India. \nAlthough priced at only 10 cents a sachet, the product yielded a 50 percent margin. But after disap -\npointing overall results, the company transitioned the brand to a philanthropic venture.16\nStill, this approach can work, even in highly complex categories such as medical care. In  Bangalore, \nIndia, Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospital charges a flat fee of $1,500 for heart bypass surgery that costs \n50 times as much in the United States. The hospital has low labor and operating expenses and an \nassembly-line view of care. The approach has yielded results: The hospital\u2019s mortality rates are half \nthose of U.S. hospitals. Narayana also operates on hundreds of infants for free and profitably offers \ncatastrophic health insurance to 2.5 million poor Indians for 11 cents a month.\nServing low-income communities can also benefit marketing efforts in higher-income markets. \nThe transfer of innovations from developing to developed markets is what is often referred to as reverse \ninnovation. Reverse innovation  adopts successful solutions developed to meet the needs and con -\nstraints of a developing market to create an inexpensive product that can be introduced as a cheaper \nalternative in developed markets. Reverse innovation can also involve public policy benefits, which can \ntransform industries through the successful development of ultra-low-cost transportation, renewable \nenergy, clean water, micro-finance, affordable health care, and low-cost housing.\nAmong successful reverse innovators, Nestl\u00e9 repositioned its low-fat Maggi brand dried noodles\u2014a \npopular, low-priced meal in rural Pakistan and India\u2014as a budget-friendly health food in Australia and \nNew Zealand.

It now can sell a range of products priced from low to high and is looking into infotainment \nsystems for motorbikes, a popular form of transportation in emerging markets and around the world.\nTo serve a growing middle class in many emerging markets, a number of firms are assembling \nproduct portfolios to tap into different income segments.

Tata \nalso targeted other \u201cbottom of the pyramid\u201d markets, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. \nDespite its positive features, the Nano got off to a rocky start in India, partly because of the \nstigma attached to buying a \u201ccheap\u201d car. In a country where incomes had risen dramatically \nin recent years, some saw it as a glorified version of a tuk-tuk, the three-wheeled motorized \nrickshaw often seen on the streets of developing nations. Many low-income consumers opted \nto stretch their budgets to buy the Maruti-Suzuki Alto with its bigger 800cc engine. On the other \nhand, some target customers who had never owned a car before were intimidated by Tata\u2019s \nglittering showrooms.

But unlike cause marketing, which aligns its \nbusiness activities to support a cause, social marketing aims to further  a cause, such as \u201csay no to drugs\u201d \nor \u201cexercise more and eat better.\u201d32 Furthermore, unlike cause marketing, which is typically done by \nfor-profit organizations, social marketing is typically done by nonprofit or government organizations \nand is not directly related to a particular business activity.\nSocial marketing is about influencing behavioral change for social good by using a systematic \nmarketing planning process that involves some well-defined audience segment. Social marketers ini -\ntially focused on the issues of tobacco, family planning, and HIV/AIDS. Social marketing now includes \nefforts to improve public health, prevent injuries, protect the environment, contribute to communities, \nand enhance financial well-being. Today there are over 2,000 practitioners around the world working \nmainly in nonprofit organizations to advance the social good. Social marketing should not be confused \nwith social media marketing, which describes how to use social media in marketing campaigns.33\nDifferent types of organizations conduct social marketing in the United States. Government agen -\ncies involved in social marketing include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Depart -\nment of Health and Human Services; the Department of Transportation; and the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency. The many hundreds of nonprofit organizations engaged in social marketing include \nthe American Red Cross, the United Way, and the American Cancer\u00a0Society.\nChoosing the right goal or objective for a social marketing program \nis critical. Should a family-planning campaign focus on abstinence or \nbirth control? Should a campaign to fight air pollution focus on ride \nsharing or mass transit? Although social marketing uses a number of \ndifferent tactics to achieve its goals, the planning process follows many \nof the same steps as those used for traditional products and services. \nOne organization that has accomplished its goals through the applica -\ntion of modern marketing practices is the World Wildlife Fund.\nWorld Wildlife Fund  The world\u2019s leading conservation \norganization, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) works in 100\u00a0countries \nand is supported by more than 1 million members in the United \nStates and close to 5 million globally. Its annual budget does not \nallow for lavish marketing, so it relies primarily on direct marketing \nto solicit contributions. The organization sends about 36\u00a0million \npieces of eco-friendly mail in the United States each year, \ngarnering 65 percent of its membership revenue by that means. \nIt\u00a0is active on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and earns revenue \nthrough partnerships with a host of firms, including Avon, Disney, \nGap, and Royal Caribbean Cruises. partnerships sometimes \ninclude joint marketing programs; Coca-Cola donated $2 million \nfor a campaign to help create safe areas for polar bears in Canada \nand other Arctic regions. WWF also tackles important wildlife \nissues head on, as with its multimedia anti-poaching campaign \nthat used billboards, print ads, public service announcements, \nand online posters with the tagline \u201cStop Wildlife Crime\u2014It\u2019s Dead \nSerious.\u201d WWF also offers cause marketing opportunities to for-\nprofit companies, such as the cobranded World Wildlife Fund Visa \ncredit card offered jointly with Bank of America.34>> Coca-Cola introduced a collectible  limited-edition \n250ml aluminum bottle named polar Bear to convey a \nmessage on environmental awareness.\nSource: Oqbas/Shutterstockcountries. The donations were good marketing too. The firm has garnered heaps of publicity, and \nAT&T and American Express even featured Mycoskie in a commercial. TOMS also sponsored its \n\u201cA Day Without Shoes\u201d promotion to help people imagine what life would be like shoeless.

Both for-profit and nonprofit \ncompanies ultimately aim to create market value, but for-profit companies define value in monetary \nterms, whereas nonprofits define it in terms of benefiting society.\nThe concept of social marketing is related to that of brand activism .35 Brand activism  entails a \ncompany taking a stand on an important\u2014typically controversial\u2014social, economic, environmental, \nor political issue. As a form of social marketing, brand activism is associated with a focus on societal \nissues that customers and employees care about, rather than on issues that concern the company\u2019s \nbottom line. What makes brand activism stand out from other forms of social marketing is that it \ninvolves a company taking a prominent and early position on a divisive issue that has important soci -\netal implications.\nAn example of brand activism is Nike\u2019s decision to prominently feature former San Francisco \n49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2014 the front man of an NFL player movement to kneel, during \nperformance of the U.S. national anthem, in protest of police killings of Black Americans\u2014in its ad \ncampaign celebrating the 30th anniversary of its motto \u201cJust Do It.\u201d The tagline of Nike\u2019s campaign, \n\u201cBelieve in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,\u201d took a clear stance in support of the \nvalues espoused by Kaepernick\u2019s actions. This decision ultimately resulted in some customers\u2019 embrac -\ning the brand\u2019s actions and others boycotting Nike products.\nSustainability-Focused Corporate Social \nResponsibility\nSustainability \u2014the ability to meet humanity\u2019s needs without harming future generations\u2014now \ntops many corporate agendas. Major corporations outline in great detail how they are trying to \nimprove the long-term impact of their actions on communities and the environment. Coca-Cola, \nAT&T, and DuPont have even installed chief sustainability officers (CSOs).\nConsumers have put their very real sustainability concerns into words and actions, focusing on \ngreen products and endorsing a wide range of environmental issues. Consumer interest in green prod -\nucts has expanded to the auto, energy, and technology sectors, in addition to personal care, food, and \nhousehold products. A growing number of consumers indicate their preference for buying products \nfrom environmentally responsible companies.\nMany aspects of \u201cgreen\u201d culture\u2014from organic purchase to recyclability\u2014have gone mainstream \nas consumers have increasingly turned to digital devices to learn about the environment and share \ntheir green experiences.36 Interestingly, although some marketers assume younger people are more \nconcerned than others about the environment, some research suggests that older consumers actually \ntake their eco-responsibilities more seriously.\nEnvironmental issues are also playing an increasingly important role in product design and manu -\nfacturing. Many firms are considering ways to reduce the negative environmental consequences of \nconducting business, and some are changing the way they manufacture their products or the ingredi -\nents that go into them. In a fascinating twist, Levi Strauss found a highly creative way to address the \nproblem of proliferating plastic bottles.\nLevi\u2019s  If someone said your jeans were \u201cmade of garbage,\u201d you might be insulted, but \nnot if they were made by levi Strauss.

Thus, establishing ethical and legal boundaries in \nmarketing to children online\u2014and offline\u2014continues to be a hot topic.49\nTelevision can be especially powerful in reaching children, and marketers are using it to target \nthem at younger ages than ever before with product tie-ins for just about everything\u2014 Disney Princess  \ncharacter pajamas, retro G.I. Joe toys and action figures, Dora the Explorer  backpacks, and Toy Story  \nplaysets.\nTeachers and parents are divided about the ethics of the increasingly heavy marketing push involv -\ning children. Some side with groups such as Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, whose mem -\nbers believe that children are incredibly susceptible to advertising and that schools\u2019 endorsements of \nproducts make children believe the product is good for them\u2014no matter what it is. Yet many schools \nand day care centers operating on tight budgets welcome the free resources and promotional materi -\nals that marketers offer, such as Care Bear worksheets, Pizza Hut reading programs, and Nickelodeon \nmagazines.\nNot all attempts to target children, minorities, or other special segments draw criticism. \n Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s Colgate Junior toothpaste has special features designed to get children to brush \nlonger and more often. Thus, the issue is not who is targeted, but how and for what purpose. Socially \nresponsible marketing calls for targeting that serves not only the company\u2019s interests but also the \ninterests of those targeted.\nMANAGING CUSTOMER PRIVACY\nAlmost every time consumers order products by mail or telephone, apply for a credit card, or take out \na magazine subscription, their names, addresses, locations, and purchasing behaviors are captured \nand subsequently used by companies to market their offerings to these consumers. This naturally \nraises the concern that marketers may know too much about consumers\u2019 lives, and that they may use \nthis knowledge to unfair advantage.50\nMany consumers are generally aware of cookies, profiles, and other online tools that let \n e-commerce businesses know who they are and when and how they shop, but they are nevertheless \nconcerned by the extent to which companies gather information about them. One area of concern \nis that a company\u2019s ability to pinpoint a person\u2019s whereabouts with geolocation technology enables \nmarketers to track consumers\u2019 daily routines, frequently visited establishments, and even their move -\nments within a retail store. When Nordstrom informed customers it was testing new technology to \nmonitor their movements by tracking signals from their smart phones, some consumers objected, \nleading Nordstrom to drop the experiment.\nThe exploding amount of digital data created by individuals online can nearly all be collected, \nbought, and sold by advertisers, marketers, ad networks, data brokers, website publishers, social net -\nworks, and online tracking and targeting companies. Companies know or can find consumers\u2019 age, \nrace, gender, height, weight, marital status, education level, political affiliation, buying habits, hobbies, \nhealth, financial concerns, vacation dreams, and much more.\nThe thought of such widespread transparency worries consumers. Research shows that more \npeople, especially older consumers, are refusing to reveal private information online. At the same time, \nconsumers are accepting more privacy intrusions every day, perhaps because they don\u2019t realize what \ninformation they are giving out, don\u2019t feel they have a choice, or don\u2019t think it will really matter.

New parents are highly lucrative customers, but with birth \nrecords public, a slew of companies all discover them at the same time. To beat others to the punch, \n Target studied the buying histories of women who signed up for new-baby registries at the store \nand found that many bought large amounts of vitamin supplements during their first trimester and \nunscented lotion around the start of their second trimester. Target then used these purchase markers to \nidentify women of child-bearing age who were likely to be pregnant and sent them offers and coupons \nfor baby products timed to the stages of pregnancy and later baby needs. When the practice became \nknown, however, some criticized the company\u2019s tactics, which had occasionally been the means by \nwhich family members learned that someone in the household was expecting.

It was \nan emotional experience.\u201d He had a vision of bringing the \nItalian  coffeehouse tradition back to the United States and \nconvinced the founders of Starbucks to test the coffeehouse \nconcept in downtown Seattle, where the first Starbucks caff\u00e8 \nlatte was served in 1984. Following the success of the coffee-\nhouse experiment, Schultz left Starbucks for a short time to \nstart his own Il Giornale coffeehouses, which offered brewed \n coffee and espresso beverages made from Starbucks coffee \nbeans.

Over the years, \nStarbucks has invested more than $100 million in collabora-\ntive farmer programs and activities.\nStarbucks is considered one of the leading  organizations \nwhen it comes to green initiatives.
