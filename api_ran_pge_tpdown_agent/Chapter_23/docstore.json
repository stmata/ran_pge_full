"text": "Measuring Emotions in the Consumption \nExperience \nMARSHA L. RICHINS* \nAlthough consumption-related emotions have been studied with increasing fre\u00ad\nquency in consumer behavior, issues concerning the appropriate way to measure \nthese emotions remain unresolved. This article reviews the emotion measures \ncurrently used in consumer research and the theories on which they are based; \nit concludes that the existing measures are unsuited for the purpose of measuring \nconsumption-related emotions. The article describes six empirical studies that \nassess the domain of consumption-r~lated emotions, that identify an appropriate \nset of consumption emotion descriptors (the CES), and that compare the use\u00ad\nfulness of this descriptor set with the usefulness of other measures in assessing \nconsumption-related emotions. \nThe role of affective processes is an important subject \nof study in consumer behavior (see Cohen and Areni \n[1991] for a review). Although most studies of consumer \naffect have focused on consumers' responses to advertis\u00ad\ning, research concerning emotions that result from con\u00ad\nsumption itself has appeared with increasing frequency \nin the literature. Scholars have examined the emotions \ngenerated by the use of specific products (Holbrook et al. \n1984; Mehrabian and Wixen 1986), by services (Oliver \n1994), by one's favorite possessions (Schultz, Kleine, and \nKernan 1989), or more generally in a variety of consump\u00ad\ntion situations (Derbaix and Pham 1991; Havlena and \nHolbrook 1986; Richins, McKeage, and Najjar 1992). \nOther research has investigated the relationship between \nconsumption emotions and satisfaction (e.g., Mano and \nOliver 1993; Westbrook 1987; Westbrook and Oliver \n1991). All of these studies have found emotions to be \nan important component of consumer response, and the \nimportance of emotions in the sphere of consumer behav\u00ad\nior has been firmly established. \nIn their study of consumption-related emotions, con\u00ad\nsumer behavior scholars have based much of their work \non frameworks of emotion developed in psychology. Al\u00ad\nthough the foundation laid by theorists in this field has \nprovided a useful starting point for investigation, it is not \nclear that the measures of emotion developed by these \ntheorists are appropriate for consumer behavior applica\u00ad\ntions. At present, consumer behavior scholars have scant \n*Marsha L. Richins is professor of marketing, College of Business \nand Public Administration, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO \n65211.

Lacking \nthis information, they have tended to rely on precedence \nwhen choosing measures rather than being guided by an \ninformed consideration that matches the measurement \nmethod to the substantive problem at hand. The present \narticle attempts to help researchers make better choices \nwhen assessing consumption emotions by addressing \nthree objectives. The first is to examine in a comprehen\u00ad\nsive way the emotional states associated with consump\u00ad\ntion. The second objective is to assess the usefulness of \nexisting emotion measures in assessing consumption-re\u00ad\nlated emotions. Finally, an alternative method for as\u00ad\nsessing consumption-related emotions is proposed and \ntested. \nMEASURES OF EMOTION \nTo assess emotions in the consumption or any other \ndomain, one must be able to characterize emotion and \ndistinguish it from other states. Unfortunately, this has \nnot been an easy problem to solve. Plutchik (1980) re\u00ad\nviewed 28 definitions of emotion. He concluded that there \nwas little consistency among the definitions and that many \nof them were not sufficiently explicit to give a clear idea \nwhat an emotion actually is. \nLacking a clear definition, some authors have attempted \nto enhance understanding of emotions by more com\u00ad\npletely specifying their characteristics.

The measures most com\u00ad\nmonly used for this purpose are described below. I \nThe Basic Emotions and Their Measurement \nSome scholars have attempted to order the universe of \nemotions by identifying a set of basic or fundamental \nemotions, although there is no widespread agreement con\u00ad\ncerning the number or the nature of basic emotions. In \none approach, basic emotions are viewed as biologically \nbased and universally experienced. The work of two \nscholars who take a biological perspective has had partic\u00ad\nular impact in the field of consumer behavior. \nBoth Plutchik (1980) and Izard (1977) place impor\u00ad\ntance on the role of emotions in enhancing an organism's \nchances of survival (Darwin [1872] 1979). Plutchik used \nan evolutionary perspective to identify eight \"primary\" \nemotions consisting of fear, anger, joy, sadness, accep\u00ad\ntance, disgust, expectancy, and surprise. According to \nPlutchik (1980, p. 138), these eight emotions have adap\u00ad\ntive significance in the struggle for survival and are identi\u00ad\nfiable in some form at all phylogenetic levels in the animal \nkingdom. He developed the Emotions Profile Index (Plut\u00ad\nchik and Kellerman 1974) to measure these emotions in \nhumans. The index contains 62 forced-choice emotion \ndescriptor pairs; responses are transformed into scales \nrepresenting each of the eight emotions. Holbrook and \nWestwood (1989) developed their own shorter measure \nofPlutchik's primary emotions. Their scale contains three \nadjectives for each emotion; and respondents report the \nfelt intensity of each of the adjectives (see also Havlena \nand Holbrook 1986). \nIzard examined emotions by focusing on the role facial \nmuscle responses associated with emotion play in enhanc\u00ad\ning survival. Based in part on the identification of emo\u00ad\ntions that are universally associated with and recognizable \nin distinctive facial expressions, the 10 fundamental emo\u00ad\ntions Izard proposed consist of. interest, enjoyment, sur\u00ad\nprise, distress (sadness), anger, disgust, contempt, fear, \nshame/shyness, and gUilt. Izard's (1977) Differential \nEmotions Scale (DES) measures these 10 emotions and \nis available in four forms. The DES-II has been used most \nfrequently in consumption emotion research. It contains \n30 adjective items, three to measure each of Izard's 10 \nfundamental emotions. Several authors have noted the \n'This article does not attempt a comprehensive review of the emotions \nliterature.

This calls into \nquestion the validity of measures founded on the notion \nof basic emotions. \nThe PAD Measure \nThe PAD (pleasure-arousal-dominance) scale devel\u00ad\noped by Mehrabian and Russell (1974) has been used by \nmarketing scholars to assess emotional responses to some \ntypes of marketing stimuli. The objective of this scale is \nquite different from that of measures based on emotion \ntheory, both in terms of context and content. With respect \nto context, the PAD scale was designed not to capture \nthe entire domain of emotional experience but rather to \nmeasure emotional responses to environmental stimuli \nsuch as architectural spaces. Although the scale may be \nsuitable to assess consumers' responses to store environ\u00ad\nments, for instance, its validity in assessing emotional \nresponses to the interpersonal aspects of shopping and \nconsumption cannot be assumed. \nA difference in content between the PAD scale and \nthe other measures is even greater than the difference \nin context. The PAD scale does not purport to measure \nemotions per se; instead, it assesses the perceived plea\u00ad\nsure, arousal, and dominance elicited by a set of environ\u00ad\nmental stimuli. It contains 18 semantic differential items, \nsix each for pleasure, arousal, and dominance. One cannot \nunequivocally infer the existence of specific emotion \nstates such as joy, guilt, anger, or fear from a person's \nPAD scores. Thus, the PAD scale is best used when a \nresearcher is interested in measuring the dimensions un\u00ad\nderlying emotion states and does not need to know the \nspecific emotions being experienced by study participants. \nMeasures of Emotion Responses \nto Advertising \nEmotion responses to advertising have been investi\u00ad\ngated extensively (see Wiles and Cornwell [1990] for a \nreview of measures).

First, many of the emotions elicited by advertis\u00ad\ning are vicarious rather than directly experienced and thus \nare likely to be of lower intensity. Aaker, Stayman, and \nVezina (1988) have explicitly recognized the low inten\u00ad\nsity of emotions generated by advertising. Second, many \nadvertising executions are dramatic enactments that are \ncapable of representing and perhaps eliciting the entire \nrange of feelings available to consumers. The range of \nemotions elicited by consumption is probably more re\u00ad\nstricted. \nBecause of the importance of attention and cognitive \nresponse in determining advertising effectiveness, adver\u00ad\ntising measures frequently assess interest, boredom, skep\u00ad\nticism, and other cognitive responses. Although highly \nrelevant in the advertising context, these reactions are \nprobably less relevant to consumption. Including such \ndescriptors unnecessarily increases the length and cum\u00ad\nbersomeness of a measure when it is used to assess con\u00ad\nsumption emotions. In addition, many of the advertising \nresponse measures were designed for use in a laboratory \nsetting and are not well suited to use in surveys or field \nstudies because of their considerable length. For instance, \nAaker et al. (1988) used 180 feeling descriptors. \nTwo research teams have developed shorter measures. \nBatra and Holbrook (1990) describe a scale with 34 emo\u00ad\ntion descriptors that assesses 12 types of affective re\u00ad\nsponses to advertising. These measures showed accept\u00ad\nable levels of reliability and evidence of validity when \nused to assess responses to advertising. Edell and Burke \n(1987) found that the feelings elicited by ads could be \nsummarized by three factors: upbeat feelings, negative \nfeelings, and warm feelings. Their 52-item measure is \neffective in assessing the underlying dimensions of the \nemotion states elicited by advertising; it is not designed \nto measure the specific emotion states experienced during \nconsumption. \nLimitations of Existing Measures \nAlthough the emotions measures described above have \nproved useful in the contexts for which they were devel\u00ad\noped, several limitations in their application to the study \nof consumption-related emotions must be recognized. In \naddition to the limitations associated with each scale, \nmentioned above, the following considerations limit their \nusefulness. First, all of the scales ignore. some of the \nemotions that are particularly central in people's lives. \nNone of the measures grounded in emotions theory assess \nfeelings of love, for instance. \nSecond, most of the measures contain some terms not \nfamiliar to many consumers. Words such as \"melan\u00ad\ncholy,\" \"contemptuous,\" \"sheepish,\" \"revulsion,\" and \n\"brooding\" are not part of the everyday vocabulary of \nmost people, yet they appear in the scales described \nabove. Some measures are also confusing. The PAD scale \nuses semantic differential items in which the two anchor points are not always clear opposites (e.g., bored and \nrelaxed; cared for and in control), potentially causing con\u00ad\nfusion among respondents. Consumer behavior research\u00ad\ners have routinely revised or adapted existing emotions \nmeasures for use in the consumer context, which suggests \nthat they recognize some of these problems. \nFinally, the appropriateness of using existing measures \nto assess emotions elicited in consumption situations is \nunknown. Emotions are context specific, and the emotions \nthat arise in the context of intimate interpersonal relation\u00ad\nships are likely to differ in intensity and quality from the \nemotions experienced when buying a pair of shoes. At \nits most intense level, love may cause a father to give his \nlife to rescue his child from a burning building. Intensely \nexperienced anger can result in assault or murder. It is \nquite unlikely that consumption experiences will result in \nsuch extremes of emotional intensity. \nConsumption emotions may also differ in character \nfrom emotions experienced in other contexts; that is, some \nemotions experienced in the context of interpersonal rela\u00ad\ntionships may rarely be experienced during consumption. \nIn their desire to represent the full range of emotional \nexperience, emotion scholars usually examine many pos\u00ad\nsible contexts without focusing on any particular one. \nWhether the measures developed for this larger perspec\u00ad\ntive are efficient and appropriate for the types of emotions \nexperienced in consumption situations has not been sys\u00ad\ntematically investigated.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4646, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65fbf382-070c-494d-8552-f252c9398747": {"__data__": {"id_": "65fbf382-070c-494d-8552-f252c9398747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ec5b37d-829f-411b-a09b-2a1c0e01bf85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "hash": "7ef8c659bce1d90f4faa8f448980ea6d8a8a01ab560e8287dc4804c36fbb87e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f254952-0628-4040-882f-a42ac15d7e70", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "hash": "7dad9200d5ec4e8c64cf5baf728ce1b3bc1cf1fd32820919db368d7a7b049456", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c42d39c2-e94d-454b-954d-663fbc1802c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76ea0de6c3b12d0a7972687a781487d8ef0aa3fee7e62133ae6e0d70ef42cacc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At \nits most intense level, love may cause a father to give his \nlife to rescue his child from a burning building.

For the \nsituations involving purchases, the questionnaire con\u00ad\ntained items about the nature of the object or service \npurchased and open-ended questions concerning respon\u00ad\ndents' emotions when considering making the purchase, \nwhen actually making the purchase, and when using the \nproduct. At each stage, there were prompts for both posi\u00ad\ntive and negative feelings. The \"favorite possession\" sur\u00ad\nvey asked about positive and negative feelings when \"us\u00ad\ning or looking at\" the possession. \nRespondents. Surveys were completed by 49 under\u00ad\ngraduate business students during class and by 48 of 180 \nadult consumers who received a questionnaire by mail. \nExcept for student subjects who also reported feelings \nexperienced when disposing of a possession, respondents \nreported their feelings for one consumption situation only. \nAnalysis. Two coders who had been briefed on the \nnature of emotions examined written responses to the \nquestionnaire and independently identified the emotion \nwords used by each respondent. Coders independently \nidentified identical emotion terms in the written protocols \n3Prior to undertaking the surveys, six depth interviews were carried \nout for the same purpose. While the depth interviews were useful in \nproviding a wealth of detail about specific consumption situations, they \nwere not as useful as had been hoped in identifying a broad range of \nconsumption-related emotions. Even though probes were used, in any \none interview only a small number of emotions were spontaneously \nmentioned by a particular respondent. Thus, the depth interviews were \nimpractical for obtaining information about a large variety of consump\u00ad\ntion-related emotions. JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH \nof 94.8 percent of the respondents. Disagreements were \nresolved by the author. \nResults \nPositive emotions predominated among the feelings de\u00ad\nscribed by respondents: happiness, relief, and excitement \nwere mentioned most frequently. Among the negative \nemotions, worry, sadness, and guilt were most common. \nThe emotion descriptors from this study were combined \nwith emotion-like terms identified in earlier studies of \nconsumption emotions (Gardner and Rook 1988; Havlena \n1985; Havlena, Holbrook, and Lehmann 1989; Richins et \nal. 1992; Schultz et al. 1989), descriptors from standard \nemotions measures, and emotion words from Shaver et \nal.'s (1987) study of emotion concepts, yielding a list of \n285 words. In line with Ortony et al.'s (1988) criteria for \nemotions, this list was reduced by eliminating (1) words \nthat refer to bodily states (e.g., \"sleepy\"), (2) subjective \nevaluations that become emotion-like only when juxta\u00ad\nposed with the word \"feeling\" (e.g., \"feeling confident,\" \n\"feeling stupid\"), (3) behaviors (e.g., crying), and (4) \naction-tendency words (e.g., \"hesitant,\" \"tempted\"). \nDescriptors that have been singled out by prior research\u00ad\ners as being largely cognitive in nature (e.g., \"inter\u00ad\nested,\" \"confused,,)4 or that have been rated as \"not \nemotions\" or were unfamiliar to subjects in prior studies \nwere also eliminated (Clore et al. 1987; Shaver et al. \n1987).

There \nwas no evidence for a systematic order effect. \nDimensions of Emotion Experience. The purpose of \nstudy 4 was to reduce the length of the emotion descriptor \nset while maintaining the diversity of emotion experiences \nassociated with consumption. Although factor analysis is \nthe usual technique for item reduction in scale develop\u00ad\nment, the goal of factor analysis is to find the minimum \nnumber of factors that account for observed variance. \nConsistent with this goal of data reduction, several factor \nanalytic studies of emotions have yielded two major fac\u00ad\ntors of consumption-related emotions-one representing \npositive and the other representing negative affect (e.g., \nOliver 1994; Richins et al. 1992; Westbrook 1987). How\u00ad\never, as Westbrook and Oliver (1991), among others, have \npointed out, using only the summed positive and negative \naffect measures does not capture the nuance, diversity, \nand patterning of emotions needed to fully understand the \nnature of the consumption experience. The data reduction \nobjective of factor analysis is incompatible with the diver\u00ad\nsity objective of the present study. \nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) is a more appropriate \ntool to meet study objectives. Redundancy among emo\u00ad\ntion descriptors can be examined by identifying descrip\u00ad\ntors with similar coordinates on the dimensions of the \nMDS solution, while diversity is assessed by examining \nthe distribution of emotion descriptors in the multidimen\u00ad\nsional solution space. For the following analyses, the sam\u00ad\nple was randomly split into two subsamples of roughly \nequal size. MDS was performed separately on the two \nsubsamples so that stability of the solution could be as\u00ad\nsessed. \nEuclidean distance was calculated for each pair of emo\u00ad\ntion descriptors in the first subsample, and the resulting \nmatrix was subjected to MDS analysis. Stress coefficient \nand interpretability criteria indicated that the two-dimen\u00ad\nsional solution was most appropriate. (Stress coefficients \nfor the one-, two-, and three-dimensional solutions were \n.29, .16, and .12, respectively; variance accounted for by \nthe three solutions was 89.1 percent, 93.8 percent, and \n95.6 percent, respectively. The third dimension in the \nthree-dimensional solution was not interpretable.) \nStability of the MDS solution was assessed by per\u00ad\nforming an MDS analysis on the second subsample and \ncorrelating the coordinates obtained in the two solutions \nacross the 97 emotion descriptors. The solution showed \nremarkable stability: correlations were .99 and .95 for \ndimensions 1 and 2, respectively. \nFigure 1 shows a plot of selected MDS weights ob\u00ad\ntained in the initial analysis. Some synonymous descrip\u00ad\ntors that occupy the same area of the MDS solution and JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH \nothers that occur in the most crowded areas of the MDS \nspace have been excluded. The emotion space revealed \nin Figure 1 is a flattened circumplex, or ellipsis, showing \ngreater differentiation among emotions on the first dimen\u00ad\nsion than on the second. Although a number of studies \nhave identified a circumplex representation of emotions \n(e.g., Larsen and Diener 1992; Russell 1980), findings of \ncircumplex affect structure seem to depend on the pres\u00ad\nence of descriptors of physical states to yield a true cir\u00ad\ncumplex shape (Scherer 1984; Shaver et al. 1987). In \nsuch studies, descriptors such as \"sleepy\" or \"drowsy\" \nusually constitute the extreme negative pole of the second \ndimension; descriptors such as \"active\" or \"aroused\" \nappear at the positive pole (see, e.g., Russell 1980; Wat\u00ad\nson and Tellegen 1985). The flattening of the circumplex \nwhen physical states are omitted is not surprising and is \napparent in the results of other studies (e.g., MacKinnon \nand Keating 1989; Morgan and Heise 1988). \nConsistent with earlier research, the first dimension of \nthe MDS solution represented positivity-negativity of the \nemotion experienced.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4228, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bde99aae-f11a-47a6-abbf-d1477aabb472": {"__data__": {"id_": "bde99aae-f11a-47a6-abbf-d1477aabb472", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0dbee53-a89f-47bb-87b6-13275aa4861d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "hash": "e683092485c04de2a108a2e9de2836c4eea5215e8474e79abe4d1f3e63342cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4980e29a-ac5a-491a-8d64-0643611d4301", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "data/Chap23.pdf"}, "hash": "da1916f9320fe958cd6b817fa2b6275d09d1b28b00a0e6c9fe83a69c5eb8e136", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "48f0c69d-dc25-4024-915f-ca92c69ae2f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7550f3603cdd9955497a5f5f7f3f55944ff7b252df1873ff0060537c416e120", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1987).

more active emo\u00ad\ntions such as anger or worry. One generally thinks of fear \nas an active state: an individual is threatened in some way, \nperhaps with bodily harm, and fight or flight responses are \nactivated to minimize that harm. However, it is important \nto keep in mind the context of emotion examined in this \nstudy. The fear a consumer experiences because s/he \nmight make a suboptimal purchase or become confused \nwhen using a newly purchased computer is very different \nin kind and intensity from what one might experience \nwhen facing a mugger in a lonely alley or driving an \nunfamiliar car over icy, treacherous roads in the dark. \nReducing the Emotion Descriptor Set \nThe MDS solution was used to reduce the emotion \ndescriptor set to a more useful size. This involved two \nactivities: determining which descriptors within a cluster \nshould be retained and determining which emotion de\u00ad\nscriptors that were not part of a cluster should be retained. \nEmotion Clusters. The number of descriptors in a \ncluster ranges from two to eight (see Table 1). Although \nreducing each cluster to a single representative emotion \ndescriptor would provide a usefully short instrument, \nmaintaining two or three descriptors per cluster results in \nless measurement error. The following criteria were used \nto determine which descriptors would be retained in each \ncluster. Items retained in each cluster after application of \nthese criteria are noted by a superscript \"a\" in Table 1. \n1.

Clusters should reflect the diversity of experience \nwithin the emotion category. When two descrip\u00ad\ntors within a cluster were extremely similar-in \nmeaning, in proximity within MDS space, and \nas measured by the correlation between the two \ndescriptors-one was eliminated. \n4. Two factors concerning placement within multidi\u00ad\nmensional space were considered: the descriptors \nwithin a cluster should possess spatial coherence, \nand each cluster should maintain some separation \nin the multidimensional space from clusters with \ndifferent semantic meanings. \n5. Correlations among descriptors within a cluster \nshould be sufficiently high that they can be \nsummed to form a single variable to represent \nthat cluster (see Table 1). \nExtracluster Descriptors. Although it is desirable to \nhave at least two descriptors for each emotion measured, \nmany of the descriptors in study 4 did not fall into a \ncluster. A single descriptor emotion was kept if it has \nan unambiguous meaning and met one of the following \ncriteria. \nA. The emotion was reported as being experienced \nby at least one-third of the respondents in both \nstudies 3 and 4, and the descriptor occupies an \notherwise sparse area of the MDS space. \nB. At least one-third of respondents reported they \nhad experienced the emotion, and the variance in \nconsumers' responses to the descriptor cannot be \nwell explained statistically by other emotion de\u00ad\nscriptors retained in the set. In applying this crite\u00ad\nrion, an emotion was retained if the other descrip\u00ad\ntors accounted for less than 40.0 percent of the \nvariance in that emotion term. \nThe Appendix shows the final set of clustered and \nindividual emotion descriptors that met the above crite\u00ad\nria. This descriptor set, referred to as the Consumption \nEmotion Set (CES), is expected to adequately represent \nconsumers' emotional reactions to most consumption \nexperiences. Researchers desiring a slightly shorter \nmeasurement instrument may choose to use only two \ndescriptors from those clusters that contain three. Re\u00ad\nsearchers desiring a somewhat more comprehensive \nmeasurement instrument may choose to add descrip\u00ad\ntors. Accordingly, a footnote to the Appendix shows the \ndescriptors that would be added to the list if criterion B \nwas relaxed to include emotions experienced by only \none-quarter of respondents and for which the variance \nexplained by other emotion descriptors is less than 50 \npercent. \nCronbach's alpha is reported in parentheses for clusters \nin the Appendix that contain three descriptors; correlation \ncoefficients are reported for two-descriptor clusters. All \nthree-descriptor clusters possessed a reliability coefficient greater than .75. The correlations between items in the \ntwo-descriptor clusters were .55 or greater except for the \nenvious-jealous cluster (r = .39). \nSTUDY 5 \nStudies 1-4 culminated in the CES, a set of emotion \ndescriptors that represents the range of emotions com\u00ad\nmonly experienced in the consumption context. Study 5 \ncompares the efficacy of the CES with that of other emo\u00ad\ntion measures in representing the range of consumption\u00ad\nrelated emotions. \nData Collection \nTwo surveys were carried out through similar meth\u00ad\nods.

Order effects for both data collections \nwere assessed as in study 4. There was no evidence of a \nsystematic order effect. \nReliability. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the \nsubscales of the various emotion measures. Reliabilities \nfor the existing scales were generally comparable to those \nreported in the literature, although in some cases they \nwere considerably lower, possibly because scale items \nwere intermixed rather than grouped by subscale, which \nlowers reliability coefficients (Allen, Machleit, and Ma\u00ad\nrine 1988). Reliabilities for the CES in the two data col\u00ad\nlections were about the same as those obtained in study \n4 (see the Appendix). \nEmotion Measures in Multidimensional Space \nTo assess the distribution of the emotion measures in \nmultidimensional space, the items composing each mea\u00ad\nsure were separately subjected to a multidimensional scal-\ning analysis. . \nThe DES-II Measure. An examination of stress val\u00ad\nues suggested that a two-dimensional MDS solution \nwas appropriate for the DES (stress values for the \none-, two-, and three-dimensional solutions were .24, \n.12, and .09, respectively; R2 values were 95.2 percent, \n97.7 percent, and 98.4 percent, respectively). The solu\u00ad\ntion is shown in Figure 2. The first dimension represents \npositive versus negative affect. The swath of variables \nat the left side of the plot suggests an interpretation of \nthe second dimension as reflecting receptivity or activ\u00ad\nity. However, the extremes of this dimension, repre\u00ad\nsented by variables measuring \"interest\" at the posi\u00ad\ntive pole and \"surprise\" at the negative pole, do not \nreadily fit this interpretation. \nOther scholars have noted that the DES is dominated \nby negative emotions, and this is illustrated by the con\u00ad\nfiguration of variables in multidimensional space. Al\u00ad\nthough the DES measures enjoyment, it provides no nu\u00ad\nance or discrimination among positive emotions along the \nactivity dimension. It does not, for instance, assess posi\u00ad\ntive emotions of low activity such as contentment or love, \nnor does it measure positive emotions with high activity \nlevels such as excitement. \nMeasures Based on Plutchik's Work. A two-dimen\u00ad\nsional solution was also deemed appropriate for the MDS \nanalysis of the descriptors used to measure the basic emo\u00ad\ntions described by Plutchik (stress values for the one-, \ntwo-, and three-dimensional solutions were .24, .14, and \n.10, respectively; R2 values were 93.6 percent, 97.0 per\u00ad\ncent, and 97.9 percent, respectively). The first dimension \nrepresents positivity of affect; the second dimension, JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH \nagain, appears to represent activity or receptivity (see \nFig. 3). \nThe MDS plots of Izard's DES and the items based on \nPlutchik's set of emotions are remarkably similar. The \ntwo plots differ in the location of the cluster of variables \nmeasuring surprise (which is operationalized quite differ\u00ad\nently in the two measures) and in the larger number of \nnegative emotions measured by the DES. Beyond this, \nhowever, the plots are almost identical (allowing for the \nreversal of poles for both dimensions). Measures based \non Plutchik's work; like the DES, do not identify or dis\u00ad\ncriminate among the various forms of positive emotions, \nand the plots for both measures contain large empty areas \nin the MDS space. \nBatra and Holbrook's Measure. A two-dimensional \nMDS solution was also used for the Batra and Holbrook \nmeasure (stress values for the one-, two-, and three-di\u00ad\nmensional solutions were .26, .15, and .11, respectively; \nR2 values were 90.8 percent, 94.5 percent, and 96.0 per\u00ad\ncent, respectively).

The measures most commonly used \nfor this purpose in prior research-the DES, the PAD, \nand Plutchik-based measures-do not represent the diver\u00ad\nsity of these emotions and thus may be inadequate for \nsome research purposes. These earlier measures may be \nparticularly inappropriate when the researcher desires a \nbroad assessment of the emotions a consumer might be \nexperiencing or when theory offers little a priori informa\u00ad\ntion about the kinds of emotional states that may be rele\u00ad\nvant to the behavior under investigation. \nTwo measures of emotions elicited by advertising were \nalso studied. The Batra and Holbrook measure was nearly \nas comprehensive as the CES in assessing consumption-JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH \nrelated emotions. However, it omits some emotions that \nare important in some consumption situations. Guilt, \nworry, eagerness, and optimism were feeling states im\u00ad\nportant for distinguishing the three consumption situa\u00ad\ntions analyzed in study 6. The Batra and Holbrook mea\u00ad\nsure does not assess any of these feelings. The Edell and \nBurke measure is also less suited to study consumption\u00ad\nevoked emotions. Although this measure represents the \nmultidimensional space of emotions well, the scale makes \nno provision for differentiating among specific emotions. \nIt is also the longest of the measures tested but did no \nbetter than the other, shorter measures in discriminating \namong the consumption situations examined in study 6. \nBoth advertising-oriented measures contain several items \nthat are more relevant to assessing reactions to advertise\u00ad\nments than to consumption experiences. Such feelings \nas suspicious, bored, uninvolved, and dull were rarely \nreported by respondents in studies 5 and 6. \nThe CES described in this article is not intended to be \na definitive assessment tool. Rather, it should be consid\u00ad\nered as the starting point in determining the proper assess\u00ad\nment of consumption-related emotions. It aims for a rela\u00ad\ntively broad, but not exhaustive, coverage of consumption \nemotion states.

For \nsome contexts, theory or common sense may suggest that \ncertain emotions are unlikely to be experienced; in these \ncases, the researcher may choose to omit the descriptors \nfor those emotions from their measuring instrument. In \nstudies of emotion, researchers may routinely choose to \nomit the descriptors measuring surprise, as many emotion \nscholars consider it an unvalenced cognitive state rather \nthan an emotion.

In particular, scholars might \ninvestigate the ability of the CES, relative to other \nemotion measures, to explain downstream variables \nsuch as satisfaction, word-of-mouth, and other vari\u00ad\nables described in Exhibit 1. The validity and use\u00ad\nfulness of the CES could also be assessed by examining \nits sensitivity as a dependent variable. Such analyses \nmight assess whether the CES (compared with alterna\u00ad\ntive measures) provides richer description and reveals \nmore differences among consumers in varying ante\u00ad\ncedent states. For instance, research might determine \nwhether predictable differences in emotional states oc\u00ad\ncur for consumers who are low versus high in product \ninvolvement, who are novice versus experienced prod\u00ad\nuct users, or who have completed a planned versus an \nimpulsive purchase. \nAlso of interest would be research that examines, in \ndepth, the character of individual consumption-related \nemotions and that identifies their antecedent states. It \nwould be useful to know, for instance, exactly what it \nmeans to feel pride in product ownership, the conditions \nthat create feelings of pride, and the effects of these feel\u00ad\nings on other consumer variables such as brand loyalty \nand word of mouth. Joy, fear, and guilt associated with \nconsumption are other emotions worthy of such attention. \nResearch by emotion theorists who have studied specific \nemotions in clinical settings or other contexts may serve \nas useful starting points for such investigations (see, e.g., \nLewis and Haviland 1993), and interpretive and phenome\u00ad\nnological approaches may be particularly useful in deep\u00ad\nening our knowledge of these facets of consumption expe\u00ad\nrience.
