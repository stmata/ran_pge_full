ultimate goal of the marketing process. It is the beginning of build -\ning and managing customer relationships for the purpose of creating a loyal customer base. \nCultivating loyal customers is a priority for market-driven companies that seek to gain and defend \ntheir market position. Indeed, without building customer loyalty, a company will have to constantly \ninvest in acquiring new customers to replace disloyal customers who have switched to competitive \nofferings in search of a better deal.\nCustomer loyalty is the result of a company\u2019s efforts to consistently deliver a positive product, \nservice, and brand experience. Although their enhanced capabilities can help companies earn strong \ncustomer loyalty, increased consumer capabilities pose challenges. Regardless, marketers must connect \nwith customers\u2014informing, engaging, and maybe even energizing them in the process. Customer-\ncentered companies are adept at building customer relationships in addition to products; they are \nskilled in market engineering as well as product engineering. Creating user communities plays an \nincreasing role for many companies and industries that seek new ways to satisfy customer needs and \nbuild loyalty. SoulCycle is a vivid example of a company that has achieved market success by building \na loyal customer base.Building Customer Loyalty19\nBuilding a community and \n creating an emotional  attachment \nwith customers have fueled \n SoulCycle\u2019s expansion.\nSource: Noam Galai/Getty Images", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1533, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea7f1041-a995-435d-b8eb-5d8bd3b62a02": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea7f1041-a995-435d-b8eb-5d8bd3b62a02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a59eca6b-f5ef-4db9-8c99-b68763a46f12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "912fce89c87bd83847a48ece324d5f45a9748cb687601939e68460e60bfab6ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9efaaf2c-b874-446e-bc5d-fab78c85bcc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "e19aaef8d7e555f6159825ed3f9f0507ae98f32c44f77489d041d7612f85964f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9c75472-d515-4ea0-8baa-a217e517982c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77fafd095067bc717f5e76e7bb293e4c70a806297f0d060913afc64742aa6777", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "419\nPART 7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\n>>> Co-founded by Elizabeth Cutler and Julie Rice in 2006, SoulCycle had the vision to create \nan alternative to the traditional fitness routines that lacked passion and felt too much like work. \nTogether, Cutler and Rice developed a 45-minute indoor cycling class that features high-intensity \ncardio, muscle-sculpting strength training, and rhythm-based choreography. Designed to be much \nmore than just a workout, SoulCycle aims to create a shared experience for riders and build a \ncommunity that motivates members, inspiring them to unlock their full potential. The first SoulCycle \nstudio, located on West 72nd Street in Manhattan, featured 33 bikes placed in a darkened room \nwhere energetic instructors led riding sessions to the rhythm of customized playlists. The SoulCycle \nconcept struck a chord with riders, and during the next few years, Cutler and Rice opened several \nadditional studios in the New York City area.

To achieve success in acquiring and retaining customers, a company must \nhave a clear understanding of the customer acquisition funnel and effectively balance its customer \nacquisition and retention efforts.\nTHE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION FUNNEL\nThe main steps in attracting customers can be imagined in terms of a funnel that depicts the phases \nin the customer acquisition process, from merely being aware of an offering to becoming loyal advo -\ncates. The customer acquisition funnel  can be represented in terms of five relatively distinct phases: \nawareness, appeal, ask, act, and advocate.2 This five-phase (or 5-A), narrowing approach to evaluating \nthe customer acquisition process is depicted in Figure 19.1.\nLearning Objectives  After studying this chapter you should be able to:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3082, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9c75472-d515-4ea0-8baa-a217e517982c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9c75472-d515-4ea0-8baa-a217e517982c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8a90e92-9c4c-4775-a9dc-d5bf2e09a5dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "f56f1852e8a832cf2f59855805184f8a245cd65c59dd7e8f07dcfcfa2fbb72c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea7f1041-a995-435d-b8eb-5d8bd3b62a02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "912fce89c87bd83847a48ece324d5f45a9748cb687601939e68460e60bfab6ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "656207b3-1285-439a-9e96-979843c28636", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a55b4772a2d66676e1347ef2ef9780ba68ca855bae6ec70e63aad34336ea31dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "420 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nThe awareness  phase is the gateway to customers\u2019 interaction with the company\u2019s offering. It is in \nthis phase that target customers encounter the company\u2019s offering. This encounter can be driven by \nthe company\u2019s marketing communication, can occur at the point of sale, or may stem from advocacy \nby other customers and collaborators.\nAwareness usually is not limited to a single offering. Often customers become aware of multiple \nofferings that could potentially meet their active need. This can happen when customers seek \ninformation on the different means to fulfill their need at the point of purchase or when they are \nexposed to the company\u2019s or competitors\u2019 marketing communication campaigns. It can also happen \nwithout any external influence when, based on prior experience, customers recall a set of available \nofferings.\nThe appeal  phase reflects the fact that although customers might become aware of multiple \nofferings, they do not actively consider all of them. Instead, they tend to shortlist the most appealing  \nofferings in order to form a consideration set composed of offerings that are most likely to fulfill their \nneed. Thus, the appeal phase of the decision process can be viewed as a process of selective elimination, \nparing down the initial set of offerings that came to customers\u2019 minds.\nDuring the ask phase, customers seek additional information about the offerings in their consider -\nation set. This additional information can come from external sources such as friends and family, the \nmedia, and/or the company and its collaborators. For example, customers might call friends for advice, \ncontact the company for more information, browse online reviews, use an app to compare prices, and \neven try out products at stores.\nThe act phase marks a transition from information gathering and evaluation to an action typically \ndirected at a particular offering. Customer actions are not limited to purchase: They reflect the total \nownership and usage experience, which also includes actual consumption of the product or service as \nwell as the post-consumption experience.\nThe advocate  phase reflects customers\u2019 reactions following their consumption experience. Ideally, \ncustomers\u2019 reactions will involve a certain level of loyalty to the company and its offering. These reac -\ntions can range from simply repurchasing the offering to ultimately advocating the offering to others. \nActive advocates recommend products, services, and brands they love without even being asked. They \nshare positive experiences with others and often become evangelists.\nThe different steps of the decision funnel do not always occur in the linear process depicted in \nFigure 19.1; they can involve multiple iterations, reconsidering and reevaluating the available data, \nand gathering new information. And customers do not necessarily go through all of the Five A\u2019s; \nthey might skip one or more of the five phases. For example, a customer might make an impulsive \npurchase without forming a consideration set and gathering additional information about the alter -\nnative options. Likewise, loyal advocates might not be actual purchasers of the company\u2019s offering. \nApple products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, for example, are often advocated by \nnon-buyers.\nBALANCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND CUSTOMER \nRETENTION\nEffective management of customer acquisition and retention involves clear understanding and accu -\nrate estimation of customer conversion and retention rates. By calculating conversion rates \u2014the \npercentages of customers at the different stages who move to the next stage\u2014managers can identify \nany bottleneck stage or barrier to building a loyal customer base. If the percentage of recent users is \nsignificantly lower than that of triers, for instance, something might be wrong with the product or \nservice that prevents repeat buying.\nThe customer acquisition funnel also emphasizes how important it is not just to attract new \ncustomers but also to retain and cultivate existing ones. Research on customer retention suggests \nthat acquiring new customers can cost several as much as satisfying and retaining current ones.

It has further been suggested that profit rate \ntends to increase over the life of the retained customer because of increased purchases, referrals, price \npremiums, and the reduced ratio of operating costs to service.3\nSatisfied customers are the company\u2019s customer relationship capital . If the company were sold, \nthe acquiring company would pay not only for the plant, equipment, and brand name but also for the \ndelivered customer base , the number and value of customers who will do business with the new firm.\nSome service providers are plagued by \u201cspinners,\u201d customers who switch carriers at least three \ntimes a year looking for the best deal. Many mobile carriers and cable TV operators lose 25 percent \nof their subscribers each year at the cost of billions of dollars. Defecting customers cite unmet needs \nand expectations, poor product/service quality and high complexity, and billing errors. Different \nacquisition methods yield customers with varying levels of loyalty. One study showed that customers \nacquired through the offer of a 35 percent discount had about one-half the long-term value of custom -\ners acquired without any discount.4 Many of these customers were more interested in the offer than \nin the product itself.\nTo reduce the defection rate, the company must define and measure its retention rate . For a mag -\nazine, a good measure of retention is its subscription renewal rate. Next, the company must identify the \nactionable causes of customer defection. For example, poor service, shoddy products, and high prices \ncan all be addressed by the company, whereas issues such as customers moving out of the geographic \narea served by the company cannot be addressed. Finally, a company must compare the lost customer\u2019s \nlifetime value to the costs of reducing the defection rate . As long as the cost to discourage defection is \nlower than the lost profit potential, a company should spend the money to try to retain the customer.\nService outcome and customer loyalty are influenced by a host of variables. One study identified \nmore than 800 critical factors that cause customers to switch services.5 Among the key factors are pric -\ning issues (high price, price increases, unfair pricing, deceptive pricing); convenience issues (location/\nhours, wait time for appointment and service); core service failure (service mistakes, billing errors, \nservice catastrophes); service encounter failures (uncaring, impolite, unresponsive, unknowledgeable); \nresponse to service failure (negative response, no response, reluctant response); competition (found \nbetter service); ethical problems (cheat, hard sell, unsafe, conflict of interest); involuntary switching \n(customer moved, provider closed).\nRegardless of how hard companies may try, some customers inevitably become inactive or drop \nout. The challenge is to reactivate them through win-back strategies.6 It\u2019s often easier to reattract  \nex-customers (because the company knows their names and histories) than to find new ones. Exit \ninterviews and lost-customer surveys can uncover sources of dissatisfaction and help win back only \nthose with strong profit potential.7\nManaging Customer Satisfaction \nand\u00a0Loyalty\nLoyalty has been defined as \u201ca deeply held commitment to rebuy or repatronize a preferred product \nor service in the future despite situational influences and marketing efforts having the potential to \ncause switching behavior.\u201d8 Customer loyalty can be thought of as a continuum, with different levels \nof loyalty varying in strength. Loyalty can range from satisfaction with the company\u2019s offering to \nadvocacy and evangelism from customers who think of the offering as a part of their own identify \nand feel responsible for its success.\nWegmans  When drama teacher Maura Morrison and her students at Algonquin Regional High \nSchool in Northborough, Massachusetts, put on The Musical  in homage to Wegmans, it featured \nuniforms donated by the local store and the chain\u2019s eclectic decorations such as Casanova, an \nanimatronic rooster that crows every hour.

Without fulfilling customer needs, \na company would find it challenging to create a loyal customer base. The essence of customer satis -\nfaction, the role of product and service quality as a driver of customer satisfaction, and the different \napproaches to measuring customer satisfaction are discussed in the following sections.\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION\nSatisfaction is a person\u2019s feelings of pleasure or disappointment that result from comparing the per -\nceived performance (or outcome) of a product or service with expectations.10 If the performance \nor experience falls short of expectations, the customer is dissatisfied. If it matches expectations, the \ncustomer is satisfied. If it exceeds expectations, the customer is highly satisfied or delighted.\nCustomer assessments of product or service performance depend on many factors, including the \ntype of loyalty relationship the customer has with the brand.11 Consumers often form more favorable \nperceptions of a product with a brand they already feel positive about. Research has also shown an \nasymmetric effect of product performance and expectations on satisfaction: The negative effect on \ncustomer satisfaction produced by failure to meet expectations is disproportionately stronger than \nthe positive effect of exceeding expectations.12\nAlthough the customer-centered firm seeks to create high customer satisfaction, that is often not \nits ultimate goal. Increasing customer satisfaction by lowering price or increasing services may result in \nlower profits. Alternatively, a company might be able to increase its profitability by means other than \nincreased satisfaction (for example, by improving the efficiency of the manufacturing processes). Further -\nmore, because a company typically has many stakeholders\u2014including employees, dealers, suppliers, and \nstockholders\u2014spending more to increase customer satisfaction might divert funds from increasing the \nsatisfaction of these stakeholders. Ultimately, the company must try to deliver a high level of customer sat -\nisfaction, while also delivering acceptable levels of satisfaction to its stakeholders, given its total resources.\nHow do customers form expectations? Expectations result from past buying experience, the \nadvice of friends and associates, public information and discourse, and information and promises \nfrom marketers and competitors. If a company raises expectations too high, the buyer is likely to be \ndisappointed. If it sets expectations too low, it won\u2019t attract enough buyers (although it will satisfy \nthose who do buy).\nSome of today\u2019s most successful companies are raising expectations and delivering performances \nto match. Korean automaker Kia found success in the United States by launching low-cost, high-quality \ncars reliable enough for Kia to offer 10-year, 100,000-mile warranties. Amazon\u2019s consistency in order \nfulfillment and on-time delivery has raised customer expectations of its future performance.\nFor customer-centric companies, customer satisfaction is both a goal and a marketing tool. Com -\npanies need to be especially concerned with their customer satisfaction level today, because the internet \nallows consumers to quickly spread both good and bad word of mouth to the rest of the world. Some \ncustomers set up their own websites to air grievances and galvanize protests, targeting high-profile \nbrands such as United Airlines, Walmart, Home Depot, and Mercedes-Benz.13\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE QUALITY AS A DRIVER \nOF\u00a0CUSTOMER SATISFACTION\nSatisfaction will also depend on product and service quality. Quality  is often described as \u201cfitness for \nuse,\u201d \u201cconformance to requirements,\u201d and \u201cfreedom from variation.\u201d A popular definition describes \nquality as the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to 4,000 people requested that Wegmans build a store near them. Wegmans has succeeded at \ntransforming a boring task into a social happening. Each location is laid out to feel like a European \nopen-air market, replacing the grocery store vibe with mini-shops staffed by dedicated experts \nand customer service that has been described as \u201ctelepathic.\u201d Stores regularly host music \nevents, culinary demos, and tastings with local farmers.

We can say the seller \nhas delivered quality whenever its product or service meets or exceeds customers\u2019 expectations.\nA company that satisfies most of its customers\u2019 needs most of the time is called a high-quality \ncompany, but we need to distinguish between performance  and consistency . Performance reflects the over -\nall functionality of a company\u2019s products and services. Consistency, on the other hand, reflects the \ndegree to which a company\u2019s performance remains at the same level over time. A Lexus automobile \nprovides higher performance than a Hyundai: The Lexus rides more smoothly, accelerates faster, and \nruns problem-free longer. Yet both Lexus and Hyundai deliver consistency if all the units deliver their \npromised quality.\nProduct and service quality, customer satisfaction, and company profitability are intimately \nconnected. Higher levels of quality result in higher levels of customer satisfaction, which, in turn, \nsupport higher prices. Studies have shown a high correlation between relative product quality and \ncompany profitability.15 The drive to produce goods that are superior in world markets has led some \ncountries to recognize or award prizes to companies that exemplify the best quality practices, such \nas the Deming Prize in Japan, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the United States, and \nthe European Quality Award.\nSome companies are tempted to increase short-run profits by lowering costs and cutting corners. \nThis may boost profits in the short run, but if quality declines as a result of these measures, customer \nexperience and longer-term profits will suffer. Home Depot ran into trouble when it became overly \nfocused on cost cutting.\nHome Depot  When Home Depot decided to expand into the contractor supply business, \nwhile also cutting costs and streamlining operations in its 1,800+ u.S. stores, it replaced many \nfull-time workers with part-timers who soon made up about 40 percent of store staff.

Nevertheless, marketing plays \nan especially important role in helping companies identify and deliver high-quality goods and services \nto target customers. How do marketers help? They correctly identify customer needs and requirements. \nThey communicate customer expectations properly to product designers. They make sure customer \norders are filled correctly and on time. They check that customers have received proper instructions, \ntraining, and technical assistance in the use of the product. They stay in touch with customers after the \nsale to ensure that they are, and remain, satisfied. They gather customer ideas for product and service \nimprovements and convey them to the appropriate departments. When marketers do all this, they \nmake substantial contributions to total quality management and customer satisfaction, as well as to \ncustomer and company profitability.\nMEASURING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION\nMany companies systematically measure how well they treat customers, identify the factors shaping \nsatisfaction, and change operations and marketing as a result.17\nStrategically minded firms measure customer satisfaction regularly because it is a key to cus -\ntomer retention. A highly satisfied customer generally stays loyal longer, buys more as the company \nintroduces new and upgraded products, talks favorably to others about the company and its products, \npays less attention to competing brands, is less sensitive to price, offers product or service ideas to the \ncompany, and costs less to serve than new customers because transactions can become routine.\nThe company needs to recognize, however, that customers define good performance differently. \nGood delivery could mean early delivery, on-time delivery, or order completeness, and two customers \ncan report being \u201chighly satisfied\u201d for different reasons. One may be easily satisfied most of the time, \nand the other might be hard to please but was pleased on this occasion. It is also important to know \nhow satisfied customers are with competitors in order to assess \u201cshare of wallet\u201d or how much of the \ncustomer\u2019s spending the company\u2019s brand enjoys: The more highly the consumer ranks the company\u2019s \nbrand in terms of satisfaction and loyalty, the more the customer is likely to spend on the brand.18\nPeriodic surveys can track customers\u2019 overall satisfaction directly and ask additional questions \nto measure repurchase intention, likelihood or willingness to recommend the company and brand to \nothers, and specific attribute or benefit perceptions likely to be related to customer satisfaction.\nCompanies that do achieve high customer satisfaction ratings make sure their target market knows \nit. Once they achieved number-one status in their category on J. D. Power\u2019s customer satisfaction rat -\nings, General Motors, Hyundai, American Express, and Alaska Airways (among others) communicated \nthat fact.\nCompanies need to monitor their competitors\u2019 performance too. They can monitor their customer \nloss rate  and contact those who have stopped buying or who have switched to another supplier to find \nout why. Companies can also hire mystery shoppers  to pose as potential buyers and report on strong and \nweak points experienced in buying the company\u2019s and competitors\u2019 products.\nManagers themselves can enter company and competitor sales situations where they are unknown \nand experience firsthand the treatment they receive, or they can phone their own company with \nquestions and complaints to see how employees handle the calls. For example, IKEA\u2019s founder Ingvar \n Kamprad made frequent incognito visits to his own stores to ensure consistency of operations and \nsuperior service delivery.\nThe University of Michigan has developed the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) to \nmeasure consumers\u2019 perceived satisfaction with different firms, industries, economic sectors, and \nnational economies.19 Research has shown a strong and consistent association between customer \nsatisfaction, as measured by ACSI, and a firm\u2019s financial performance in terms of ROI, sales, long-term \nfirm value, and other metrics.20 \u201cMarketing Insight: Net Promoter Score and Customer Satisfaction\u201d \nexplains why some companies believe just one well-designed question is all that is necessary to assess \ncustomer satisfaction.21\nBUILDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY\nIt is not enough to attract new customers; the company must also keep them and increase their busi -\nness. Too many companies suffer from high customer defection. Yet many still focus the majority of \ntheir promotional efforts on acquiring new customers rather than on trying to retain existing ones, \ndespite the high costs associated with the need to constantly counteract customer churn.

These strategies are \ndiscussed next.\nInteract Closely with Customers.  Connecting customers, clients, patients, and others \ndirectly with company employees can be highly motivating and informative for the company employ -\nees. End users can offer tangible proof of the positive impact of the company\u2019s products and services, \nexpress appreciation for employee contributions, and elicit empathy. A brief visit from a student who \nhad received a scholarship motivated university fundraisers to increase their weekly productivity by \n400 percent; a patient\u2019s photograph inspired radiologists to improve the accuracy of their diagnostic \nfindings by 46 percent.22\nIn addition to informing and motivating company employees, maintaining close relationships and \ninteracting with customers often benefit these customers. Interacting with the company helps keep \ncustomers engaged with the company\u2019s products, services, and brands, which, in turn, helps create \ncustomers who are loyal to the company. Customers who believe that the company is listening to their \nconcerns and is trying to fulfill their needs are more likely to stay loyal and are less likely to switch to \na competitor offering a better deal.\nListening to customers is crucial to customer relationship management. Some companies have \ncreated an ongoing mechanism that keeps their marketers permanently plugged in to frontline cus -\ntomer feedback.\nDeere & Company, which makes John Deere tractors and has a superb record of customer \n loyalty\u2014nearly 98 percent annual retention in some product areas\u2014has used retired employees \nto interview defectors and customers.23\nChicken of the Sea has 80,000 members in its Mermaid Club, a core-customer group that receives \nspecial offers, health tips and articles, new-product updates, and an informative e-newsletter. In \nreturn, club members provide valuable feedback on what the company is doing and thinking of \ndoing. Their input has helped design the brand\u2019s website, develop messages for TV advertising, \nand craft the packaging.\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop uses a \u201cCub Advisory Board\u201d for feedback and input to decisions. The \nboard is made up of twenty 5- to 16-year-olds who review new-product ideas and give a \u201cpaws up \nor down\u201d verdict. Many products in the stores are customer ideas.24\nBut listening is only part of the story. It is also important to be a customer advocate and, as much \nas possible, to take the customers\u2019 side, understand their point of view, and, when appropriate, modify \nthe company\u2019s offering to create greater customer value.\nDevelop Loyalty Programs.  Loyalty programs are a type of promotional incentive designed \nby companies to encourage customers to continue to patronize their business and, in some case, to \nincrease the frequency and quantity of the products and services they purchase from the company. \nLoyalty programs are designed to reward customers who buy frequently and in substantial amounts. \nThey can help build long-term loyalty with high-value customers, creating cross-selling opportunities \nin the process. Pioneered by airlines, hotels, and credit card companies, loyalty programs now exist \nin many other industries. Most supermarket and drug store chains offer price club cards that grant \ndiscounts on certain items.\nTypically, the first company to introduce a loyalty program in an industry gains the most benefit, \nespecially if competitors are slow to respond. After competitors react, loyalty programs can become a \nfinancial burden to all the offering companies, but some companies are more efficient and creative in \nmanaging them. Some loyalty programs generate rewards in a way that locks customers in and creates \nsignificant switching costs. Loyalty programs can also produce a psychological boost and a feeling of \nbeing special and elite that customers value.25 Designer Shoe Warehouse is one firm that recognized \nthe need to keep customers engaged in its loyalty reward program.\nDesigner Shoe Warehouse (DSW)  Although the long-time loyalty program at DSW \nwas running seamlessly, the shoe retailer realized the inherent danger of complacency.

A brand community  is a specialized community of consumers \nand employees whose identification and activities center revolve around the brand.27 Three charac -\nteristics identify brand communities. First, they share a sense of connection to the brand, company, \nproduct, or other community members. Second, they share rituals, stories, and traditions that help \nconvey the meaning of the community. Finally, they share a moral responsibility or duty both to the \ncommunity as a whole and to individual community members.\nBrand communities come in many different forms. Some arise organically from brand users, such \nas the Lugnet (LEGO) and Porsche Rennlist online discussion groups.

Members can recommend products, share reviews, \ncreate lists of recommendations and favorites, or socialize together online.\nA brand community can be a constant source of inspiration and feedback for product improve -\nments or innovations.

Managing customer rela -\ntionships is important because a major driver of company profitability is the aggregate value of the \ncompany\u2019s customer base. A related concept, customer value management, describes the company\u2019s \noptimization of the value of its customer base. Customer value management  focuses on the analysis \nof individual data on prospects and customers to develop marketing strategies to acquire and retain \ncustomers and drive customer behavior.33 Consider the experience of Dunnhumby.Harley-Davidson  Founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Harley-Davidson has twice \nnarrowly escaped bankruptcy to become one of the most widely recognized motor vehicle brands \nin the world.

We \ndiscuss these strategies in the following sections.\nCUSTOMIZATION\nCustomization can encompass adapting the actual physical product and modifying the service experi -\nence. Customization involves making the company\u2019s offering as personally relevant as possible to as \nmany customers as possible\u2014a challenge, given that no two customers are identical.  Customization \ncalls on marketers to abandon the mass market practices that built brand powerhouses in the  \n20th century for new approaches that are a throwback to marketing practices from a century ago, \nwhen merchants literally knew their customers by name and designed unique products for each  \nof them.\nTo customize the consumer experience, companies are using call centers, along with online, digi -\ntal, and mobile tools complemented by artificial intelligence and data analytics to foster continuous \ncontact between company and customer. Although technology can help with customer relationship \nmanagement, firms have to be careful not to roll out too many automated-response phone systems \nor social-networking tools as ways to satisfy customer service requests. Many customers still prefer to \ntalk to a live representative to receive more personal service\u2014an ongoing priority in building lasting \ncustomer relationships.\nCompanies are recognizing the role of the personal component in customer relationship manage -\nment and its influence once customers make actual contact with the company. Employees can create \nstrong bonds with customers by individualizing and personalizing relationships.

For a major European catalog \ncompany, Dunnhumby found that shoppers with different body types not only prefer different \nclothing styles, but also shop at different times of the year: Slimmer consumers tended to buy \nearly in a new season, whereas larger folks tended to take fewer risks and wait until later in the \nseason to see which styles proved popular.34\nBritish Airways  British Airways took personalization to a higher level with its \u201cKnow Me\u201d \nprogram. One goal was to centralize information about frequent fliers from all of the company\u2019s \nservice channels\u2014website, call center, e-mail, on board planes, and inside airports\u2014into a single \ndatabase. For any given passenger booked on a flight, British Airways knows his or her current \nseating location, previous flights and meal choices, and even prior complaint history. It also \ndistributed iPads to crew members and ground staff, allowing them to access the database as \nwell as to receive personal recognition messages about passengers on any flight. To facilitate VIP \npassenger identification, British Airways uses stored photos of fliers downloaded from Google \nImage searches.

At the same time, online companies need \nto make sure their attempts to create relationships with customers don\u2019t backfire, as happens when \ncustomers are bombarded by computer-generated recommendations that consistently miss the mark. \nBuy a few baby gifts on Amazon.com, and your personalized recommendations suddenly don\u2019t look so \npersonal! Online retailers need to recognize the limitations of online personalization while searching \nfor technology and processes that really work.\nTo adapt to customers\u2019 increased desire for personalization, while considering that not all cus -\ntomers want a relationship with the company and that many have privacy concerns, marketers have \nembraced concepts such as permission marketing. Permission marketing , the practice of marketing \nto consumers only after gaining their expressed permission, is based on the premise that marketers can \nno longer use \u201cinterruption marketing\u201d via mass media campaigns. Perhaps one of the most common \nformats of permission marketing are newsletters sent to readers who have chosen to subscribe and \nthus have granted the publisher permission to send them relevant information.\nPermission marketing implies that marketers can develop stronger consumer relationships by \nrespecting consumers\u2019 wishes and sending messages only when the consumers have expressed a will -\ningness to become more engaged with the brand. This approach can help make a company\u2019s interac -\ntions with its customers more meaningful.37\nPermission marketing, like other personalization approaches, presumes that consumers know \nwhat they want, even though they often have undefined, ambiguous, or conflicting preferences.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3485, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12569e6e-874d-43ce-8bba-496458cb5b53": {"__data__": {"id_": "12569e6e-874d-43ce-8bba-496458cb5b53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50ecd6a0-c8b4-4ff8-9035-83f3a0a18bde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "72f247bb8f41d71e7eb4d44e6b0d269f240f90e1fdce853deba7a3627b854a58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e79d7bff-1446-4cc4-b1b6-8d4175c37433", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "61dd4fd628b048a37a164bba542c484393ceb01823ed2ca1d0e15e803bab6084", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be4d8ae8-d36f-4f6c-8399-e809392baa33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42e129bbc63b4c15adf9669dc12d9dac1dfe6d5dcef11df1a180fd8d277c6803", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "430 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\n\u201cEngagement marketing\u201d might be a more appropriate concept than permission marketing because \nmarketers and consumers should work together to find out how the firm can best satisfy consumers.\nCUSTOMER EMPOWERMENT\nIn recent years customers have had an increasing opportunity to control how they interact with a \ncompany. In the past, customers were often passive consumers of marketing messages, but today they \nare able to choose whether and how they want to engage with company marketing. This phenomenon, \ncalled customer empowerment , means that companies must strengthen their relationship with \ncustomers and engage with them in new ways. Because company empowerment has been matched \nby customer empowerment, companies have to adjust to changes in the nature of their customer rela -\ntionships. To strengthen customer relationships, marketers are helping customers become evangelists \nfor brands by providing them with resources and opportunities to demonstrate their passion. Doritos \nheld a contest to let consumers name its next flavor. Converse asked amateur filmmakers to submit \n30-second films that demonstrated how the iconic sneaker brand inspired them. The best submissions \nwere showcased in the Converse Gallery website, and the best of the best became TV commercials.38\nAlthough new technologies help customers assist or become involved in a brand\u2019s marketing, \nthey can also help them avoid marketing. For example, many web browsers feature ad-blocking and  \npopup-blocking software, e-mail servers offer spam filters, and mobile phones offer call-blocking \noptions.\nAlthough much has been made of the newly empowered consumer\u2014in charge, setting the \ndirection of the brand, and playing a much bigger role in how it is marketed\u2014it\u2019s still true that only \nsome consumers  want to get involved with some of the brands  they use, and even then, only some of the time . \nConsumers have lives, jobs, families, hobbies, goals, and commitments, and many things matter more \nto them than the brands they purchase and consume. Understanding how to best market a brand given \nsuch diversity in customer interests is crucially important.39\nWhen will consumers choose to engage with a brand? Many factors can come into play, but one \nstudy revealed the following about customer pragmatism: \u201c.  . . most do not engage with companies via \nsocial media simply to feel connected.  . . . To successfully exploit the potential of social media, companies \nneed to design experiences that deliver tangible value in return for customers\u2019 time, attention, endorse -\nment and data.\u201d40 That \u201ctangible value\u201d includes discounts, coupons, and information to facilitate \npurchase. Many businesses overlook social media\u2019s capabilities for delivering customer value while cap -\nturing customer insights, monitoring the brand, conducting research, and soliciting new-product ideas.\nMANAGING CUSTOMER WORD OF MOUTH\nAlthough the strongest influence on consumer choice remains recommendations from friends and \nrelatives, recommendations from other consumers are becoming an increasingly important decision \nfactor. In an atmosphere of heightening mistrust of some companies and their advertising, online \ncustomer ratings and reviews are playing a growing role in the customer buying process.41\nA Forrester research study, for example, found that about half of consumers won\u2019t book a hotel \nthat does not have online reviews. Thus it\u2019s not surprising that more hotels are launching their own \nprogram to post reviews (Starwood places independent, authenticated reviews on individual hotel \nsites) or are using travel review sites (Wyndham streams its five most recent reviews from TripAdvisor \non its site, leading to a 30 percent increase in bookings).42 TripAdvisor has quickly become a valuable \nonline resource for travelers.\nTripAdvisor  After being frustrated by the lack of detailed, reliable, and up-to-date \ninformation available to help him decide where to go on a Mexican holiday, Stephen Kaufer \nfounded TripAdvisor in 2001. The pioneer in online consumer travel reviews, the company \ngrew quickly and is now the world\u2019s largest travel website. It allows users to collect and share \ninformation and make bookings for a wide variety of hotels, vacation rentals, airlines, restaurants, \nand other travel-related locations or businesses through its hotel and air booking partners. users \ncan post reviews, photos, and opinions and participate in discussions on a variety of different \ntopics.

Despite consumer acceptance of \nsuch reviews, however, their quality and integrity can be in question.44 In one famous example, over a \nperiod of seven years, the cofounder and CEO of Whole Foods Market posted more than 1,100 entries \non Yahoo! Finance\u2019s online bulletin board under a pseudonym, praising his company and criticizing \ncompetitors. Some companies offer computer-recognition technology to monitor for fraud. Bazaar -\nvoice helps companies such as Walmart and Best Buy manage and monitor online reviews using a pro -\ncess called device fingerprinting. The company caught one firm posting hundreds of positive reviews \nof one of its products and negative reviews of its competitor\u2019s products.45\nOnline reviews and blogging sites have struggled to police comments. To avoid attracting anony -\nmous or biased reviews, Angie\u2019s List allowed only paid and registered subscribers to access its website. \nUsers rate providers on price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality, and professionalism, using a report \ncard\u2013style scale of A to F. Other sites offer summaries of professional third-party reviews. Metacritic \naggregates music, game, TV, and movie reviews from leading critics from multiple publications and \ncombines them into a single 1-to-100 score. In the gaming industry, some game companies tie bonuses \nfor their developers to game scores on the more popular sites. If a major new release doesn\u2019t make the \n85-plus cutoff based on user reviews, the publisher\u2019s stock price may even drop.46\nMarketers may benefit from tracking social media traffic to identify popular blogs. Bloggers who \nreview products or services are influential because they may have thousands of followers; blogs are \noften among the top links returned in online searches for certain brands or categories. Firms also court \nthe favor of key bloggers via free samples and advance information. Many bloggers disclose this special \ntreatment from the companies they write about.\nFor smaller brands with limited media budgets, online word of mouth is critical. To generate \nprelaunch buzz for one of its new hot cereals, organic food maker Amy\u2019s Kitchen shipped out samples \nbefore its release to several of the 50 or so vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian food bloggers that the com -\npany tracks. When favorable reviews appeared on these blogs, the company was besieged by e-mails \nasking where to buy the cereal.47\nAs it turns out, even negative reviews can sometimes be surprisingly impactful. For one thing, \nalthough they can hurt a well-known brand, they can create awareness about an unknown or \noverlooked one. They can also provide valued information. A Forrester study of 10,000 consumers \nof Amazon.com\u2019s electronics and home and garden products found that 50 percent found negative \nreviews helpful. When consumers can better learn the advantages and disadvantages of products \nthrough negative reviews, fewer product returns may result, saving retailers and producers money.48\nDEALING WITH CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS\nSome companies think they\u2019re getting a sense of customer satisfaction by tallying complaints, but \nstudies show that even though customers are dissatisfied with their purchases about 25 percent of \nthe time, only about 5 percent of dissatisfied customers complain. The other 95 percent either feel \ncomplaining is not worth the effort or don\u2019t know how or to whom to complain. They just stop \nbuying.49\nOf the customers who register a complaint, 50 percent to 70 percent might do business with \nthe organization again if their complaint is resolved.

The 3M Company claims that more than two-thirds of its product-improvement ideas \ncome from listening to customer complaints.\nGiven that many customers may choose not to complain, companies should proactively monitor \nsocial media and other places where customer complaints and feedback may be aired.

The slower the company is to respond, \nthe more dissatisfaction may grow and lead to negative word of mouth.\n\u2022 Identify the true source of customer dissatisfaction before seeking a solution. Some complaining \ncustomers are not looking for compensation so much as for a sign that the company cares.\n\u2022 Accept responsibility for the customer\u2019s disappointment; do not shift the blame onto the customer.\n\u2022 Resolve the complaint swiftly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction, while taking into account the \ncosts of resolving the complaint and the lifetime value of the customer.\nNot all complaints, however, reflect actual deficiencies or problems with a company\u2019s product or \nservice.52 Big companies especially are targets for opportunistic customers who attempt to capitalize \non even minor transgressions or generous compensation policies.

Yet every com -\npany loses money on some of its customers. The well-known 80/20 rule suggests that 80 percent or \nmore of the company\u2019s profits come from the top 20 percent of its customers. Some cases may be \nmore extreme: The most profitable 20 percent of customers (on a per capita basis) may account for \nover 100 percent of the company\u2019s profits. The least profitable 10 to 20 percent, on the other hand, \ncan actually reduce profits, and the company breaks even with the middle 60 to 70 percent.54 The \nimplication is that a company could improve its profits by \u201cfiring\u201d its worst customers.\nCompanies need to concern themselves with how efficiently they create value from the customers \nand prospects available. It\u2019s not always the company\u2019s largest customers who demand considerable \nservice and deep discounts or who yield the most profit. The smallest customers pay full price and \nreceive minimal service, but the costs of transacting with them can reduce their profitability. Midsize \ncustomers who receive good service and pay nearly full price are often the most profitable.\nTHE CONCEPT OF CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE\nA key driver of shareholder value is the aggregate value of the customer base. The aim of customer \nrelationship management is to produce high customer lifetime value.55 Customer lifetime value \n(CLV)  reflects the monetary equivalent of the value that customers will create for the company during \ntheir tenure with the company. CLV can refer to the value created by an individual customer, or it can \nrefer to the cumulative value created by all of the company\u2019s customers\u2014\u201cthe sum of lifetime values \nof all customers.\u201d56 Customer lifetime value is also referred to as customer equity .\nCustomer lifetime value is affected by the revenue and the costs of customer acquisition, retention, \nand cross-selling. A profitable customer is a person, household, or company that, over time, yields a \nrevenue stream exceeding by an acceptable amount the company\u2019s cost stream for attracting, selling, \nand serving that customer. Note that the emphasis is on the lifetime  stream of revenue and cost. Indeed, \nfrom a company\u2019s perspective, what matters is the value that it receives over the course of all of its \ncustomer interactions, not on a particular transaction. Marketers can assess lifetime customer value \nindividually, by market segment, or by channel.\nTo effectively manage its customer relationships, a company must be able to measure the value \nthat each of its customers is likely to bring to the company over the course of that customer\u2019s tenure \nwith the company. Yet, although many companies measure customer satisfaction, few measure \nindividual customer profitability. Banks claim this is a difficult task because each customer uses \ndifferent banking services, and the transactions are logged in different departments.

Activity-based costing also allocates indirect costs such as clerical costs, office expenses, and \nsupplies to the activities that use them, rather than as a proportion of direct costs. Both variable and \noverhead costs are tagged back to each customer.\nCompanies that fail to measure their costs correctly are also fail to measuring their profit correctly \nand, therefore, are likely to misallocate their marketing effort. The key to effectively employing activity-\nbased costing is to define and judge \u201cactivities\u201d properly. One time-based solution calculates the cost \nof one minute of overhead and then decides how much of this cost each activity uses.57\nCUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE AND BRAND EQUITY\nThe customer lifetime value (customer equity) perspective and the brand equity perspective certainly \nshare many common themes. Both emphasize the importance of customer loyalty and the notion that \nwe create value by having as many customers as possible pay as high a price as possible.\nIn practice, however, the two perspectives emphasize different things. The customer equity \nperspective focuses on bottom-line financial value. The main benefit of customer equity is that it \nyields quantifiable measures of financial performance. At the same time, it does not fully account \nfor some of the important advantages of creating a strong brand, such as the ability to attract higher-\nquality employees, elicit stronger support from channel and supply chain partners, and create growth \nopportunities through line and category extensions and licensing. The customer equity approach can \nbenefit from more explicitly considering the \u201coption value\u201d of brands and their potential to affect \nfuture revenues and costs.\nThe brand equity perspective, on the other hand, tends to emphasize strategic issues in manag -\ning brands and creating and leveraging brand awareness and image with customers. It provides much \npractical guidance for specific marketing activities. However, managers who focus on brands do not \nalways develop detailed customer analyses in terms of the brand equity they achieve or the resulting \nlong-term profitability they create. Brand equity approaches could benefit from the sharper segmen -\ntation schemes afforded by customer-level analyses and from more consideration of how to develop \npersonalized, customized marketing programs\u2014whether for individuals or for organizations such as \nretailers. There are generally fewer financial considerations put into play with brand equity than with \ncustomer equity.\nResearchers have argued that a focus on either brand equity or customer equity depends on the \nway a company creates market value. In general, product-centric companies (such as like Procter & \nGamble, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo) tend to focus on brand equity as a major source of value and a key \nasset for future growth. In contrast, service-centric companies (such as banks, airlines, credit card \ncompanies, and cable and internet providers) tend to focus on customer equity as a key asset and \nperformance measure. Specifically, the distinction between focusing on brand or customer equity has \nbeen attributed to the following factors:\n\u2022 Firms that utilize subscription models\u2014such as health clubs, mobile operators, and movie \nstreaming companies\u2014are more likely to find value in customer equity; firms that do not utilize \ncontractual services tend to focus on brand equity.\n\u2022 Companies that can uniquely identify their customers and assess their profitability tend to focus \non customer equity; companies that cannot establish a direct link between a customer\u2019s behavior \nand performance outcomes tend to focus more on brand equity.\n\u2022 Companies that produce self-expressive products such as cars, apparel, and fashion accessories \ntend to focus on brand equity.\n\u2022 Companies that cannot readily obtain customer-level data and/or do not have direct contact with \ntheir customers are more inclined to focus on brand equity.\n\u2022 Service-oriented companies are more likely to focus on customer equity than are product-oriented \nfirms.\nDespite the tendency of some companies to focus on either customer equity or brand equity, both \ntypes of equity matter. There are no brands without customers and no customers without brands. \nBrands serve as the \u201cbait\u201d that retailers and other channel intermediaries use to attract customers \nfrom whom they extract value. Customers are the tangible profit engine for brands to monetize their \nbrand value.58", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4717, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "506a18cc-e77a-41bf-81e5-989a340cabb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "506a18cc-e77a-41bf-81e5-989a340cabb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec323cac-9207-40ed-9c60-17b278944ba5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "d148a5fd3eef0a4f8ef66fe52881c5a7f382a8933407044b7a198ecdcdebd77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0201cc1-fe73-46cd-8355-0f25ae1a46a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "a1767809560fc2994b5d3d8912820c19f96ebf18d3ba76360691f92cb296ec23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7ad29b6-4e20-40c3-9bd7-c7f344857a82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32d2308688093d1e15511efbc81ee466c348b4db5a74be2901a307f158a01848", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 19    |  BuIlDING  CuSTOMER  lOyAlTy 435\nBUILDING CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE\nCustomer profitability analysis and the customer acquisition funnel help marketers decide how to \nmanage groups of customers who vary in loyalty, profitability, risk, and other factors.59 Winning \ncompanies improve that value by excelling at strategies like the following:\n\u2022 Improving customer service.  Selecting and training employees to be knowledgeable and friendly \nincreases the likelihood that customers\u2019 shopping questions will be answered satisfactorily. Whole \nFoods woos customers with a commitment to provide fresh, high-quality food and deliver a supe -\nrior service experience.\n\u2022 Engaging customers.  The more engaged with the company, the more likely a customer is to \nstick around. A large percentage of new Honda purchases replace an older Honda. Drivers cited \nHonda\u2019s reputation for creating safe vehicles with high resale value. Seeking consumer advice can \nbe an effective way to engage consumers with a brand and company.\n\u2022 Enhancing the growth potential of each customer.  Sales from existing customers can be increased \nwith new offerings and opportunities. Harley-Davidson sells more than motorcycles and \naccessories like gloves, leather jackets, helmets, and sunglasses. Its dealerships sell more than \n3,000 items of clothing, and some even have fitting rooms. Licensed goods sold by others range \nfrom the predictable (shot glasses, cue balls, and Zippo cigarette lighters) to the more surprising \n(cologne, dolls, and cell phones). Cross-selling isn\u2019t profitable if the targeted customer requires a \nlot of services for each product, generates a lot of product returns, cherry-picks promotions, or \nlimits total spending across all products.60\n\u2022 Managing unprofitable customers.  Marketers can encourage unprofitable customers to buy more \nor in larger quantities, forgo certain features or services, or pay higher amounts or fees. Banks, \nphone companies, and travel agencies all now charge for once-free services to ensure minimum \nrevenue levels from these customers. Firms can also discourage those with questionable profitability \nprospects. Progressive Insurance screens customers and diverts the potentially unprofitable ones \nto competitors. However, \u201cfree\u201d customers who pay little or nothing and are subsidized by paying \ncustomers\u2014as in print and online media, employment and dating services, and shopping malls\u2014\nmay still create useful direct and indirect network effects, an important function.61\n\u2022 Rewarding the most profitable customers.  The most profitable customers can be treated in a spe -\ncial way. Thoughtful gestures such as birthday greetings, small gifts, or invitations to special sports \nor arts events can send them a strong positive signal. Hotels, airlines, credit card companies, and \nrental car agencies typically offer superior service to their best customers to ensure their loyalty, \nwhile at the same time maximizing their profitability.\nA company should aim to build customer value across all of its customer touch points. A customer \ntouch point  is any occasion when a customer encounters the brand and product\u2014from actual \nexperience to personal or mass communications to casual observation. For a hotel, the touch points \ninclude reservations, check-in and checkout, frequent-stay programs, room service, business services, \nexercise facilities, laundry service, restaurants, and bars. The Four Seasons relies on personal touches, such \nas a staff that always addresses guests by name, high-powered employees who understand the needs of \nsophisticated business travelers, and at least one best-in-region facility, such as a premier restaurant or spa.\nCREATING CUSTOMER LOYALTY BY BUILDING TRUST\nWhat does it mean to trust a company or a brand? Research over the past 30 years has shown that \ntrust is established and maintained via three important building blocks. One building block is com -\npetence. Companies and brands build competence trust  when its managers have the skills required to do \nthe job effectively, and when they meet or exceed expectations for those skills. Another building block \nis honesty. Firms build honesty trust  by consistently telling the truth and keeping promises. A third \nbuilding block is benevolence. Companies and brands build benevolence trust  when they demonstrate \ngenuine concern about the interests and goals of customers and employees.62\nWhen customers are asked about how a particular company or brand performs with regard to \nthe three building blocks, most companies learn that they are stronger with regard to some build -\ning blocks than with others. Facebook, for example, may be perceived as more competent than it \nis benevolent or honest. In contrast, a local bank may be perceived as more honest and benevo -\nlent than it is competent. It is therefore often overly simplistic to say that a company or brand is \n\u201ctrusted\u201d or \u201cdistrusted,\u201d because companies are often trusted more with some things than with", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 5013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7ad29b6-4e20-40c3-9bd7-c7f344857a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7ad29b6-4e20-40c3-9bd7-c7f344857a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67f332ff-1767-42ef-a1b9-873e6a9a40f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "9e5ad145fb048a3291c27426d985aed88a51760928972086d49223453ea6cbb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "506a18cc-e77a-41bf-81e5-989a340cabb0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "e5b32d2327a3239342cfbb419186c2bf12592a314f91147f85c2ba54a7efb4f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c19f5b4-fe0d-4989-bca2-e18ff65bfb86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd7ba9a4347c9d2fd402950e3687f5484cbfdf6a3a99b39dcc99213172141045", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "436 PART  7   |  MANAGING GROWTH\nothers.  Companies and brands need to diagnose more specifically where their trust building blocks \nare strong or weak so they can more specifically develop strategies and tactics that will fortify trust \nwhere a building block may be weak.\nResearch by Kellogg School of Management expert on trust Kent Grayson suggests that a wide \nrange of company activities can influence the extent to which customers trust a company or brand in \nterms of three building blocks: competency, honesty, and benevolence.63\n\u2022 Consumers tend to judge competence  by thinking about how what they experience with the \ncompany or brand is similar to or different from what they have experienced with relevant com -\nparison cases. For example, customers who order room service at a three-star hotel are likely to \nassess their meal in relation to meals served at other three-star hotels and restaurants. If the cus -\ntomer asks for Dijon mustard and room service delivers regular mustard instead, the customer\u2019s \ntrust in the hotel\u2019s competence will be more negatively affected if it is a five-star hotel than if it is \na three-star hotel.\n\u2022 Consumers tend to assess a brand\u2019s or company\u2019s honesty  by comparing company statements \nwith company actions. An airline that claims to have \u201cno hidden fees\u201d will become mistrusted by \ncustomers who find surprising fees on their airline ticket.\n\u2022 Customers assess a brand\u2019s or company\u2019s benevolence  based on whether they think they got a \nfair deal, and on whether those who work for the company have a clear understanding of customer \nneeds and expectations. For example, many customers believe that charging customers different \nprices for the same product is not fair, so they mistrust companies that charge customers different \nprices depending on their ZIP code.\nThe activities that most strongly influence perceptions of the three building blocks of trust will \ndiffer, depending on factors such as the culture in which the company operates, the segment that the \ncompany is targeting, and customer perceptions of the company\u2019s brand. Companies that wish to \neffectively manage trust must therefore engage in customer research before deciding which activities \nrequire investment.\nResearch has shown that each of the three building blocks is differentially affected by positive and \nnegative information. Competence is more strongly affected by positive information than by negative \ninformation. If a brand or company fails to deliver, and if the reason for the failure is related to compe -\ntence, customers are often willing to forgive the behavior, especially if the brand has been competent \nin the past. In contrast, both honesty and benevolence are more strongly affected by negative informa -\ntion than by positive information. If a brand behaves in a way that demonstrates lack of honesty or \nbenevolence, customers are less likely to forgive, even if the manager or brand has been honest and \nbenevolent in the past.\nTrust is more salient early in the development of a relationship and becomes less salient once a \nrelationship has been established and is operating successfully. Once trust is established, companies \nand brands can benefit from the trust that employees and customers have. As long as a company or \nbrand does not behave in a way that makes established customers question their trust, trust consid -\nerations move into the background of their consideration. This can sometimes encourage companies \nto exercise less care in their long-term relationships, or even to start cutting corners in ways that cus -\ntomers or employees will not notice. Although this can be an effective strategy in small measures, \nbrands and companies cannot be too cavalier about trust with long-time employees and customers. \nThe life-time value of long-term customers is often relatively high, and perceptions of trust violations \nin long-term relationships can sometimes have more significant negative effects than violations in \nshorter-term relationships.64\nMEASURING CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE\nCustomer lifetime value is typically calculated as the net present value of the stream of future profits \nexpected over the customer\u2019s lifetime purchases.65 The company must subtract from its expected \nrevenues the expected costs of attracting, selling, and servicing the account of that customer, apply -\ning the appropriate discount rate (say, between 10 and 20 percent, depending on cost of capital and \nrisk attitudes). Lifetime value calculations for a product or service can add up to tens of thousands of \ndollars or even run to six figures.\nCustomer lifetime value calculations provide a formal quantitative framework for planning cus -\ntomer investment, and they help marketers adopt a long-term perspective. Researchers and practi -\ntioners have used many different approaches for modeling and estimating customer lifetime value.66 \nCommon factors in such models include the revenues generated from a given customer, the cost", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4996, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c19f5b4-fe0d-4989-bca2-e18ff65bfb86": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c19f5b4-fe0d-4989-bca2-e18ff65bfb86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bcc1abc-b3cc-4ab3-bf68-9cf5099b9277", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "27a8663337e2008099a4f98d4d635c332ca0780abd64a89f518e2b335a6794fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7ad29b6-4e20-40c3-9bd7-c7f344857a82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "data/Chap19.pdf"}, "hash": "bdd9f7890133032fe3e9bfd3c535f1e75b8ecb8fc4abad62ca3b0b9607ef5236", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9307154-107e-4ad6-a58d-82a1e9e478a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1332dda8dcc7d7ab947663ba56051c2bc21542b16924fd0152e6ed664b997779", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 19    |  BuIlDING  CuSTOMER  lOyAlTy 437\nof acquiring and servicing this customer, the probability of customer repeat buying in the future, \nthe customer\u2019s likely tenure with the company, and the discount rate (cost of capital for the firm).  \nMarketers who use customer lifetime value concepts must also take into account the short-term, \nbrand-building marketing activities that help increase customer loyalty.\nWhen measuring customer lifetime value, it is important to consider not only the monetary value \neach customer is likely to directly generate for the company but also the strategic value this customer \nwill create by endorsing the company and its offering to others.

Because of its \nsimplicity, NPS cannot capture the different nuances of \ncustomer satisfaction and, hence, can produce inaccurate \nresults. A common criticism is that many different patterns \nof responses may lead to exactly the same NPS. For \nexample, NPS equals 20 percent when Promoters equal \n20 percent, Passives equal 80 percent, and Detractors \nequal 0 percent, as well as when Promoters equal  \n60 percent, Passives equal 0 percent, and Detractors \nequal 40 percent, but the managerial implications of the \ntwo patterns of responses are very different. Another \ncommon criticism is that NPS is not a useful predictor of \nfuture sales or growth, because it ignores important cost \nand revenue considerations.\nOthers question the Net Promoter Score\u2019s actual \nresearch support. One comprehensive academic study \nof 21 firms and more than 15,000 consumers in Norway \nfailed to find NPS superior to any other metrics, such as \nthe ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index). Some \nhave criticized both NPS and ACSI measures for not fully \naccounting for ex-customers or those who were never \ncustomers.

Bain\u2019s Frederick Reichheld suggests that only one \ncustomer question really matters: \u201cHow likely is it that you \nwould recommend this product or service to a friend or \ncolleague?\u201d\nReichheld was inspired in part by the experiences \nof Enterprise Rent-A-Car. When the company cut its \ncustomer satisfaction survey in 1998 from 18 questions \nto two\u2014one about the quality of the rental experience \nand the other about the likelihood that the customer \nwould rent from the company again\u2014it found that those \nwho gave the highest ratings to their rental experience \nwere three times as likely to rent again as those who \ngave the second-highest rating.

Popular strategies for enhancing customer \nrelationship management include customization, \ncustomer empowerment, customer word of mouth, and \ncustomer complaints.\n6. Customer lifetime value (CLV) reflects the monetary \nequivalent of the value that customers will create for the \ncompany during their tenure with the company. CLV \ncan refer to the value created by an individual customer, \nor it can refer to the cumulative value created by all of \nthe company\u2019s customers\u2014the sum of lifetime values \nof all customers. The aim of customer relationship man -\nagement is to produce high customer lifetime value.\n7. A company should aim to build customer value across \nall occasions on which a customer encounters its \nproducts, services, or brands\u2014from actual experience \nto personal or mass communication to casual \nobservation. Companies that fail to consistently deliver \nsuperior customer value are likely to see their customer \nbase eroding over time.\n8. Marketing managers must calculate the customer \nlifetime value of their customer base to understand the \nprofit implications. Customer profitability analysis helps \nmarketers identify their most valued customers and \ndevelop strategies to create value for these customers \nin a way that fosters long-term customer loyalty. When \nmeasuring customer lifetime value, it is important to \ntake into account not only the monetary value each \ncustomer is likely to directly generate for the company \nbut also the strategic value this customer will create by \nendorsing the company and its offerings to others.summary\n1. Customer loyalty reflects a deeply held commitment \nto patronize a particular product, service, or brand \nfor future purchase and consumption occasions. \nLoyalty is a continuum, with different levels of loyalty \nvarying in terms of their strength and ranging from \nsatisfaction with the company\u2019s offering to advocacy \nand evangelism.\n2. Customer satisfaction is the key to building customer \nloyalty. Satisfaction is a person\u2019s feelings of pleasure or \ndisappointment that result from comparing the actual \nperformance of a product or service to expectations. \nRecognizing that high satisfaction leads to high cus -\ntomer loyalty, companies must ensure that they meet or \nexceed customer expectations.\n3. Customer satisfaction, product and service quality, and \ncompany profitability are intimately connected. Higher \nlevels of quality result in higher levels of customer \nsatisfaction, which support higher prices and (often) \nlower costs.\n4. To ensure sustainable growth, a company must not \nonly attract new customers; it must also keep them and \nincrease their business. Losing profitable customers can \ndramatically affect a firm\u2019s profits. Three of the most \neffective strategies for building customer loyalty are \ninteracting closely with customers, developing loyalty \nprograms, and building brand communities.\n5. Customer relationship management (CRM) is the \nprocess of carefully managing detailed information \nabout individual customers and all customer touch \npoints to maximize loyalty.

Then she went out to stores and picked \nclothes based on these preferences, dropping off boxes \nat her friends\u2019 homes. They would pay her for the clothes \nthey wanted to keep, and she would return the rest. Venture \ncapitalist Steve Anderson backed the concept, and a year \nlater Stitch Fix leased a small office in San Francisco. \nEvery week, employees went out and purchased clothes \nand shipped them from the office. The demand for these \nboxes, called \u201cfixes,\u201d grew beyond what the office could \nhandle. At one point, the company had a two-year wait list. \nThis prompted Stitch Fix to expand, opening warehouses \nto manage inventory and hiring executives to streamline \nbusiness operations.\nAs Stitch Fix grew, the company was presented with a \nmajor challenge: creating a personalized stylist for everyone. \nThe highly idiosyncratic nature of fashion made it a tough \ntask for the company to predict what kinds of clothing \ncustomers would want. The company was aware that fashion \ntrends come and go in patterns that are difficult to forecast. \nIn addition, aspects such as fit, style, and material are all \nqualities that customers consider when deciding whether \nthey want to keep the clothes. If any one of these three \naspects was not to the customer\u2019s liking, Stitch Fix found \nitself with returned inventory. In the summer of 2012, Stitch \nFix made incorrect assumptions about the kinds of clothing \nits customers wanted that season and had to write off a large \namount of inventory. learning from this mistake, Stitch Fix \nbegan investing more heavily in their data-collection and \nstyling algorithms.\nStitch Fix turned to algorithm expert Eric Colson, who \nhad previously served as VP for data science and engineering \nat Netflix. In his new role as chief algorithms officer, Colson \nled his team in collecting massive amounts of data on Stitch \nFix customers. The wide breadth of data gathered included \nbody dimensions, pattern preferences, and clothes previously \nkept. Stitch Fix\u2019s machine learning\u2013backed algorithms were \nthen combined with information that required a human \nstylist\u2019s judgment, such as fashion trends and personal \nrequests made by the customer.\nThe algorithms developed by Stitch Fix improved the \nsuccess of personalized styling dramatically, which helped \nto manage inventory and ensure customer satisfaction. \nAs customers shared more information with the company, \nStitch Fix clothing recommendations became more and more \nprecise, and the company\u2019s many prediction techniques \nkept customers subscribed for long periods of time. Sales \ndata showed that a quarter of Stitch Fix customers kept their \nsubscription for at least nine months. Furthermore, Stitch \nFix\u2019s analytics became so sophisticated that they could predict what stage of the buying cycle the customer was in. \nThe data showed that most customers began their Stitch Fix \nsubscription when their closets were in need of an overhaul, \nso they would order multiple boxes in a short period of \ntime; as their closets filled, customers would become more \nand more specific in their preferences. The combination of \nthese two factors helped Stitch Fix adjust different levels of \ninventory to different types of apparel needs, ensuring that \nless inventory would be returned to the warehouse.\nStitch Fix\u2019s algorithms were not limited to optimizing \nclothing personalization; rather, they were used to improve all \naspects of company operations. The company\u2019s data science \nteam was encouraged to explore the various problems that \nStitch Fix management faced and write algorithms to improve \nlogistics, inventory procurement, and demand estimates. \nThese algorithms help to decrease capital costs, increase \ninventory turnover, and speed up product delivery. One \nalgorithm was created by tracking the movement of company \nwarehouse employees to help optimize their routes, saving \ntime and energy.\nThe machine learning that Stitch Fix employs has also \nhelped the company release its own apparel line, Hybrid \nDesign.
